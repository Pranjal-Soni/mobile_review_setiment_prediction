  Hi, this is going to be a long-detailed review…So make yourself comfortable, relax and Let’s begin.I got this device on 6th March from flipkart, pre booked on 21st Feb itself. Probably one of the early recipients of this device. Then why did I take such long to post this review?Because I didn’t want to post an incomplete review for the sake of likes and views. I want my review to help average consumer to make his decision as this is an expensive device.I’ll start with Pro’s of device, because why not? Everyone likes to hear good thing first, right? I’ll spare your time with specs as you have already seen the specs sheet anyways. This is going to be real life review.1. Dynamic AMOLED Screen: Sure, the dynamic term is marketing strategy, but you know that Samsung is the best display manufacturer and this device is no exception. I am amazed with the quality of the screen, the colour reproduction, the lowest and maximum brightness. Everything is top notch.Oh, and speaking of notches, I’ll always prefer the punch hole cut out over the hideous long notches. It’s simply less intrusive in my opinion.2. Cameras: Yup, u read it right the Camera with the ‘s’. Well u know there are 3 camera lenses but why?The main shooter is dual aperture lens meaning you’ll get crisp shots in bright daylight and brighter shots in darker night time. All this achieved due to dual f stops of 1.5 and 2.4.For an average consumer, the auto mode works like a charm and you’ll not be disappointed by any picture you click without any prior knowledge of photography.The ultra-wide shooter adds perspective to your photography. It is a must have lens and it click picture with the same width as you see with your eyes. One of the best additions to the galaxy devices in my opinion.The Telephoto lens is good to have feature for future proofing, but I hardly see using it for myself. Maybe someday I’ll be using it often than I think right now.The other modes like Super Slo Mo, Cool Live focus effects, Wide Panorama shots…All these are great to have features and fun to use.PS: Posted some clicks from night time as I know daylight shots are generally better in every phone. It’s evening or night shots where major phones struggles.3. Dual Speakers: Not the loudest but one of the best mobile speakers I ever heard. It is such a great experience to binge watch videos on any streaming service due to it’s amazing display and ever so loud dual speakers. There is no distortion at max volume and most of the times 50-70% is ideal volume for a great experience.4. Ultrasonic On Display Fingerprint: Let’s get this straight, It’s not fast as capacitive one. But it’s not about the speed after all. It’s about the future of devices. Capacitive sensors are past now and we are constantly evolving with technologies. This ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is result of cutting-edge technology which unlocks your phone with the help of sound waves. And It freaking needs your blood flow in order to work…pretty darn cool I say. In my experience, It’s fast enough for everyday use and pretty reliable too. It gets better with each passing day learning your pattern. Sure, there is a lot of room to improve here but the current gen no way is unpolished or un ready product. Also as opposed to optical sensor it works with screen off and avoids burn in issues.Pro Tip: Register your most used thumb or finger twice for best results.5. Essentials: Headphone Jack, USB C, Heart Sensor and all other varieties of sensor. Everything is present here. And the proximity and ambient light sensor is hidden under the display right next to camera cutout in front. Again freaking cool stuff. To see the sensor for yourself, call someone and check the left space next to camera cutout, you’ll see a blinking light which your proximity sensor is. And yeah Headphone Jack in 2019. That’s one hell of a deal. I’m amazed that Samsung didn’t follow the trend and listened to their customers. Great Job Samsung!6. Premium Build: And with all these extra ports, Samsung still managed to build a beautiful glass metal sandwiched design with sleek looks and a great weight distribution. No complaints here whatsoever. Great for one hand usage.7. Cool additional features: Wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, Samsung pay, Dark mode in one ui…All these are pretty useful depending on time and place. It’s good to have it than nothing.Now as no device is perfect, so is the case here. Coming to the Cons now:1. Battery: I feel the battery at the moment is just okayish. Snapdragon variants are showing great results and here in india, the exynos chip is not optimised fully which is leading to battery drain. Hopefully it would be fixed in future updates.2. Higher Power Button placement: Idk why but power button is placed above the normal position making it hard to reach for small to medium size hands. Good thing is that device supports lift to wake and double tap to wake gestures eliminating the dependency of the button completely.3. Charging Speed: Samsung restricted this device with QC 2.0 which is pretty outdated now. I wish they had matched the industry standard and included QC 4.0 support in their most premium offering. One thing I’m not happy with this device is that it takes almost 100 mins to completely charge with provided charger. Still better though than Apple I suppose 😉.4. Bixby Button: Extra button is always a good thing, but restricting it is not so useful. I am using Bxactions app from play store and have remapped my bixby button to perform 8 different actions. Hence, my button is a great addition to my device after remapping it.5. One UI icons: I feel the icons on the one ui is cartoonish and I liked the S9 icons more. But that’s my preference but overall one ui is fluid, snappy and great for one hand usage.6. Night Shots: I feel Samsung optimisation in camera software department is still behind pixel. They have great hardware but not so good software resulting in okay night shots instead of amazing pixel like quality. Maybe software update will fix it. But make no mistake, the cameras on this device is still better than the competition in most situations.I have gone great lengths now to review the device. As you see the cons are very minor as compared to pros. And most of them can be fixed with future updates.If you have the budget and thinking of buying a flagship, make no mistake that Galaxy S10 is the best one out there. Period!! Samsung put everything they had at present in this device making it near to perfect. It’s a No compromise, No nonsense phone.

  So happy to get my pre ordered S10. So far i'm impressed with most part. The display is unimaginably awesome, and pics dont do justice.

  Don't buy from Amazon. Samsung is not giving galaxy buds and watch offer on devices from AmazonUpdate.Wait for 72 hours after inserting simAnd wait for 24 hours before installing Samsung shop before redeeming offer.If you have installed then clear cache and data and uninstall app. Then wait for 24 hours and then try installing and redeeming

"
"

  The battery life is not very good. It's bad compared to most of the phones on the market today from any segment.

"

  Power adapter doesnt provide fast wireless charging on my existing pads whereas my s8 adapter does. When contacted samsung and visited service station they denied replacement. Very poor support for a premium product. Need return and full refund

"
"

  I opened the package about 5 mins back and it has heated up terribly. On top of that, when I call up amazon for the replacement policy.. the guy says he needs to prepare a technical report for which I have to download an app which i did but it did not get connected to his server.. the he suggested a technician can come over which for which a slot is available only on monday.. you buy such an expensive product and this is the experience !! Couldn’t have been more disappointed by Both samsung and amazon

  - Phone is amazing.  Speed,  display,  software everything is a huge step up for me (Coming from a Nexus 6P).  It's the most fluid phone I have ever used.- Loving all the features included - gestures,  bixby routines, smart capture,  one handed mode,  night mode and loads other stuff.- In- display ultrasonic fingerprint needs some getting used-to, but I'm loving it now.- And oh the phone is a delight to look at, screen turned on or not. The full screen display with the punch cut out is the best implementation for me.  Kudos to Samsung.- Camera in general is both really good,  but front camera during night time needs some work.  Maybe we get a software update and it's better later on.- Battery is not that great.  I foresee myself charging at least twice in a day. It still is learning my usage patterns, so maybe it's better later on but I'm not banking on it. Oh well,  I will use my same office charger as I did before.- Also,  nitpicking,  but the back glass vibrates a bit when the speaker is working. I have to check if everyone has this issue.- Despite all of this,  I have been glued to my phone for the past 3 days, I can't take my eyes and hands off it and I would buy it again.

  Its a nice phones does everything a flagship is supposed to do. But the main drawback is the poor battery backup i mean i was using oneplus 6 before this and it was better in battery performance not to forget dash charging.Also the phone is getting heated up while watching videos.Hope a software update comes soon.

  Pre-ordered the 128 gb S10 with bunch of pre-order benefits. Really fell in love with the screen quality, camera performance, and the battery life.  This is my first samsung device after using google nexus for almost 6 years including nexus 4, nexus 5x. So i was little worried about getting used to non-stock android, but the One UI software changes done by samsung is still really great to use. I got it effectively at 59,500 with 7500 discount on hdfc credit card. It's one of the coolest devices of 2019. Go for it.

  We bought this cell phone with no cost EMI for 9 month two weeks ago. Today we get a call from the bank that we will be charged an interest of 5K. We call up amazon and they said that we didn't select no cost EMI. Literally 3 of were sitting while buying this product and ensured to pick no cost EMI. The website showed that it was selected. Amazon says that it's our issue but not sure how the hell 3 people can be wrong. There's a glitch on their website. Amazon's customer service was just not helpful and didn't give any solution. They just threw the blame on us and didn't bother to help. Felt like they didn't want to do one thing to help despite us being a loyal customer for years. Please be wary about buying expensive electronics from Amazon. The horrible outcomes of buying from here outweigh any possible benefits.

  Filled with so many features that still exploring after a week of purchasing...Every day knowing another amazing feature....

"
"

  Pros:. Great screen. Good camera. Loud speakers. Very responsive. Good for games. Loving finger print senser as it works even when hands are wet.. One ui is batter then what i had on previous mobile.Cons:. BATTERY... one of the worst thing about it.. Not liking Included earphone sound. On Galaxy buds sound lags about a second or 2 while playing games.. Hard to avoid accidental touches on edges.So editing after 1.5 years of use (August 2020). Samsung will now provide os upgrades for 2 more years. I.e. for 3 years in total.. Accuracy for accidental touch detection on edges has been improved.. New upgraded camera software is awesome and night mode is now comparable to other devices.. System upgrades increased battery life a bit.

"

  I was looking for a phone with the following specs:• Max ~6 inch display (OLED) so that it's easy to hold• A flagship (or close enough) processor so that I don't need to upgrade for next few years• A headphone jack so that I don't have to dish out another ₹2500• A great after sales service network• A good camera that's not as bad as the last two I've had• A good battery that I don't need to keep charging now and againAnd I'm happy to say that apart from the last one, the S10 ticks all the other ones. The battery life isn't that bad, just more representative of a flagship like Nexus 6 from 2015. Its performance is comparable to the SD855 (in the S10 Lite) but has some mostly quality of life additions like IP68, Gorilla Glass 6, WQHD display, Dual Speakers etc. that make the extra ₹7000 over the S10 Lite sort of worth it, although I wish it was only ₹4000 more and not ₹7000.

"
"

  Features and as always samsung display is best...problem is that we can,t purchase the accessories of the same in samsung...bad thing is that samsung is doing fraud that they are not offering me the galaxy buds.

"
"

  I had chosen the ""with offer"" product including Samsung earbuds but I only got the phone and not the earbuds........

"
"

  I put a lot of thinking behind rather wasted time between S10 & 7TPro. Finally I decided to go for S10 to have my first flagship experience. After spending almost 40k including exchange I'm nothing but disappointed. I'm not at all a heavy user,don't ever use Facebook but battery man....it just simply drains even with amazon, whatsapp, couple of Google browsers.Heating is a big big issue with this phone. Its alone deal breaker. Agree display is stunning but whats the use if you can't browse, always worry about battery.network reception is as bad as a 15k phone. I think one shouldn't buy phone with exynos processor specially high end phones. Do me a favor and take my word, if you are confused between one plus 7TPro or S10or S10 plus then go for one plus. End of the day when you are ready to spend 40k you need a phone which works not the one which gives you trouble. Again....heating issue as serious as it gets.at times it gives the feeling that it could brust any moment!!

"
"

  Worst phone in the segment below are the cons1. Pathetic battery life lives upto 3 hours max regular use.2. Distortion in slightest low light.3. Super heating issue in any application. Camera, Maps being top of the list.4. Network issues and wifi receptor are way to weak compared to Apple or Oneplus.5. Doesn't work well with many apps.6. Stock Samsung apps keep showing unnecessary popup notifications and consume most of the battery.ProIt's good looking.

  There are professionals who base their careers on recieving phones, I am just a normal user, so this is going to be very short.Not a photographer, don't care about complex camera functions, and use camera for family photos onky occassionally, looks great.Coming from OnePlus 3T and Samsung Note 8, nothing extraordinary here, things run smoothly. Not a gamer.Sleeker than the other phones I have used, and extraordinarily slippery.AKG earphones look junk, not even tried them. 3.5mm is a bonus. Non-removable battery is a minus, stuck back without screws is a big minus. SD card is a plus. Being water-proof is a minor plus (usually are careful). Wireless charging might be a plus, but wireless chargers are quite expensive (for the simple coil that they have), will wait for them to become commodity.In comparison with other high-spec phones in the market, this phone charges a Samsung brand tax.

"
"

  Best Screen I've ever seen. So crisp and unreal.However, Battery Backup is the worst ever. I need to put black wallpapers,  tone down Screen Resolution, turn off all the fancy features. Basically,  convert it into a 20k phone and use it only to get 4 hours of Screen On Time?I'm definitely returning it and getting  a One Plus 7 Pro maybe.

"
"

  Well a week into being a part of an experience  called galaxy s10 i feel that I am the owner of a great phone except the battery life. Let me deceibe it in details:Screen: Best in the industry. The colour is crisp and not over saturated, but it is also the sink that drains the battery rapidly.The UI: feels awesome. Smooth  and no lag.Camera: superb, have uploaded some sample shots. Felt that the selfie camera could have been better.Battery: Thats where all the tears come from. It is below average. If you are a user who loves to play games, watch videoes for almost 4 to 5 hours a day, i would suggest carry your charger or power bank.Overall its 3 for me. Had to battle myself to choose s10 or one plus 7 pro but in the end feel i am happy with what i have got.

"
"

  Worst battery backup, and generating over heat. Unfortunately purchased. And there is no return policy. Better do not purchase.

"
"

  This is an awesome product.Fabulous screen.Compact factor.Light weightClear call qualitySuperb sound qualityIts super fast.No words for camera quality. Its fantastic.I don't play games. Getting a day on battery easily with WhatsApp, calls, browsing, camera, office apps, emails, webex etc.Must buy.Better than s10lite in following:Screen  dynamic oled,  protected with gorilla glass 6Camera, faster shutter speed captures blurr free photosStereo soundIp68 ratedLighter

"
"

  It's look like a refurbished phoneDon't buyIt's really disgustingAnd as accordingly the condition price is too high

"
"

  Good phone with just about average battery life due to the exynos chip which is shipped in India. Qualcomm chip has more power efficiency. I need to charge twice a day and I have to keep the resolution at 2k mode instead of 4k. You always need to carry an extra charger

"
"

  This review is not for the mobile but for the Amazon and its policy. I got stuck in some medical emergency after ordering and recieving the mobile so I decided to return it . Recieving it was the only mistake which I made but that too happened before I got into this situation.I requested n no. Of times and told them my situation and also the seal was not broken yet they were not ready to return. For me it was the worst experience on Amazon. Guys be aware of this policy and Amazon you need to rethink on your policies.

  I was always scared of Samsung as the phone goes slower over period. Something that i have personally notic3d everytime i used the phones. Around then galaxy s is around for a while n reliable ..but then while playing games the screens and buttons are getting heated.sometimes the screen gets heated by itself even when the phone is not in use.. Is this normal. Phone is hardly a week old and i already start3d feeling sorry as the old phone never heated.how much ever i pushed there. Day before yesterday the ear speaker suddenly started behaving weird.Had try alot of options to set the speaker right. And today it suddenly started working as normal..last week while taking photo the phone was heated n the screen was boiling. is my phone hacked already..? Am scared..alteady Samsung has a reputation of phon3 bust outs.

  Phone is perfect all-rounder. Beautiful display and promising camera that you can look for, adding to the great battery life. Samsung did a fantastic job on this phone.Great :1. Display2. Battery3. Camera4. Hardware quality5. Akg Earphones6. Size and weight7. One UI8. Fast Wireless chargingNot so great1. Fingerprint reader2. Hard to find tempered glass3. Fingerprint magnet4. Untrusted face unlockYou can live with those. It's the best Android phone in the market with great service network from Samsung. For first time Samsung did a great job with both hardware and software. Go ahead if you looking for top notch premium android smartphone.

  I have been an Iphone user ever since Iphone was launched, i tried phones but could not even hold on to anyother for more than 3-4 days.With s10 samsung has done an awesome work.Camera, screen and typing is as good as iphone even better in camera.Yes fingerprint scanner not that accurate and responsive as iphone but still a 5 star.

"
"

  A good phone. My first time with a Samsung device and I don't have too many qualms about it. The new UI is definitely better than what I've seen on other Samsung devices.I hope Samsung keeps pushing out the latest updates on time.The camera does a good job. Not sure about low light conditions yet cause I have not yet tested it with as many shots.The battery is holding out for a decent amount of time but I have not yet subjected it to any intense usage.I wish the Bixby button could be set to open Google Assistant directly in the settings. You can still do that through other means.

"
"

  Battery life is horrible  but can not complain much if you you have oled display. It could have better with OTA updates.Screen is fantastic.  Super premium quality.  Everything falls in place.Camera accept night mode is beast.  Samsung really needs to work on it considering P30 pro masterclasseOverall it's a good buy. I would definitely recommend this phone specially for those who are waiting for OnePlus7(pro)

"
"

  Amazing phone. Built quality is very good, feels nice while holding. Could have been a perfect 5 star if battery was 4000mah. Battery is good but it could have been excellent if it were 4000mah. Camera is awesome. Fingerprint very responsive. It responds even if your fingers are wet. Screen size is amazing. I don't like super huge and heavy phones. A phone should feel like a phone in my view. 5.8 to 6 inch screen sizes feel good while operating the mobile single handedly.This phone is excellent for single handed operation

"
"

  Its battery backup is really weak even when i am not using it its battery is getting drained which should not happen in this kind of high hand phone

"
"

  It was not mentioned anywhere in the description that this phone takes only Indian SIM.  After I bought I left for Africa and there I find that the mobile instrument is not compatible with local SIM.  Wish Amazon or Samsung had disclosed this information before I ordered the phone.  I am very disappointed with my purchase.  Feel cheated.

  This phone totally turned out how i expected it to.  For me this is the most elegant looking phone designs I've ever seen that is why a lot of phone manufacturers like e.g Huawei,  one plus , oppo , moto are copying the same hole or cap. punch camera cut with curved glass display .  The one UI is amazingy its smoother and faster than previous generations .  Speakers are amazing with dolby atmos.  Display is top notch like every samsung flagship phone with HDR 10+ support .  Camera is decent too but not great . And like every other phone this phone's got cons too so here they are :No Snapdragon - exynos is inferior in performance and battery management.  Due to inferior chipset this phone's battery life isn't that good plus battery's capacity should be atleast 4000 MAH.  Camera isn't that great either mainly due to chipset.  Fingerprint sensor works good but it takes more than one tries sometimes.Overall this is a great phone if you can ignore the battery life , i get an average of 4 to 5 hours screen on time which is okayish.

  Really a great slab of technology. Price is quite justified. Delivers better performance for gaming and video.Amazing camera performance for images and video recordings.Fabulous display and white back makes it beautiful phone.Battery could have been better. However reverse charging a nice feature for charging your wireless accessories.

  Why does samsung stick to exynos processors for its flag ship phones beats me. Qualcomm processors perform better, photos are better.finger print scanner sucks badly and even after a update at the samsung center , it doesn't work properly.photos are a big let down and night time pics are hopeless and so are the low light pics. Even day time pics are grainy especially when you  crop the pics 1:1.Battery doesn't let you down for a day with controlled usage.Overall not a good phone . Leaves you with a  feeling wanting for more.

"
"

  I have used it for only a week and returned it because of the reasons I felt like it has not satisfactory for the amount I payed . Display is gorgeous..finger print reader and face recognition are fast enough . But my main reason to return is because of battery..I was gettig only 3 and half hours of screen time which is rediculous..I know that it will take some time to get used to my usage patterns but I don't know for sure it will get any better ..anyway switching to one plus seven pro ...

  Pros:Excellent cameraFastCompact and beautiful designDecent Battery ( I am not a gamer)Super fast chargingExcellent ScreenExcellent multimedia qualitySolid buildCons:Samsung BloatwareI have been using this phone for a month - skeptical upgrade from iphone 6. I am loving it. Never faced any issue with the phone. Satisfied with camera, screen and multimedia quality. Wide angle camera is a killer. You will love it. Front camera is Good enough. You will find a better front camera in cheaper A71 Performance of the phone is good. No lag, no crashes. The only part of the phone which I did not like is Samsung bloatware (A lot)  I disabled whichever Samsung allows me to disable. I bought the phone @49000, now the price is dropped again. Overall I am very much satisfied with value and utility

"
"

  Not worth the money. Has poor battery life, heating issues and display sometimes shows a blue line. Amazon and Samsung not very helpful in replacing the product...so don't think that there will be easy replacements. Overall a poor experience.

"
"

  Can someone please clarify?I received this lovely gadget. Without inserting the SIM, I used the product for around 15 mins on wi-fi. Just setting up Samsung account and emails. But to my surprise I found that the product heats up immediately. This is with just 15 minutes of usage and which has disappointed me. I am a fan of S series and in my earlier S series I never found such problem with so less amount of usage.Should I raise a request for replacement?I hope you'll give your genuine opinion/feedback.

"
"

  I bought this phone few days ago and it has network connection problems. Amazon replaced with a new S10.The actual problem was not with hardware but with the network provider you are using. That network providers network  4g signal had full strength with one plus but not on galaxy S10. I changed sim but result was same 4g net work was unsteady, i inserted another popular network  companys sim and now network is steady. If somebody suspect a nexus between network provider and mobile company i will not blame them thats my experience.So if you experience net work issues with samsung S10 change your network provider.

"
"

  Pros:Excellent build quality.Prism white finish(the one I bought) beautiful while reflecting warmer colours.Hole punch over a notch screen interruption. Liked it on the corner than on the center as seen on the Note 10 leaks, as this gets you easier to ignore it.Best display, superb peak brightness, excellent colour reproduction.As a lover of compact phones, this one has a beautiful form factor. I can reach the entire screen with my right thumb.Doesn't quite heat as I had understood prior owning the device.Doesn't lag of any sort although One UI animations are sometimes chunky.Charging speed is great while refraining from comparing to other phones with greater charging speed, as they do not provide the rest of the characteristics of this one.Do not need to invest additional on a tempered glass, as most of them aren't compatible with the ultrasonic FP scanner. I usually do not mishandle the device and am okay with the pre-installed thin film.The extra button below the volume rockers which I use as my camera launcher. Samsung fans do not like Bixby either.One UI is amazing. Dark mode(on this amazong OLED slab) and one handed operations are practical.Not such a pro:Battery life is average for a phone of this caliber.Power button is pretty higher than where you expect. This increases the risk of sliding it around your palms to drop it.That asymmetry of the type c port on the bottom intimidates my OCD.You get an Exynos variant in India and many parts of the world. I would prefer the Snapdragon one, firstly for it's proven battery efficiency over the Exynos counterpart, and secondly the less availability of mods and roms including the infamous Gcam.One UI icons are cartoonish, and literally all icons on the theme store express the lack of taste of the devs. Haven't yet switched to Nova, as I am trying to adapt myself to start loving the rounded cartoon icons.

  Yesterday the phone had a 1.5 feet fall and the screen broke. It was a nice experience for last 2 months except for bad battery backup. But the screen is surprisingly fragile for a 60k phone which could not withstand a 1.5 feet fall from my bedside table on the wooden floor. Note that I was using the cover which came with the phone in the box. Samsung customer care said there is no warranty for physical damage. So I have to pay 15k to repair for replacing the screen. If the fall was from a higher place or on a hard surface, I wouldn't have been surprised. But this is ridiculous.

"
"

  Great performance,  awesome display.  Dolby atmos at it's best. Camera is disappointing, worst front camera I've ever used.

"
"

  Bad battery life. Doesn’t last for more than 6 hours even after full charge. Poor customer service and no means to reach out to the seller for additional details. Not recommended to buy from here

"
"

  Best display and camera.Processor speed superb.But it is charging slowly not like fast charging with USB c type.Front camera could have been improved.Heart rate sensor and touch sensor goodOverall good budget  flagship phone.

"
"

  looks r good. The front camera at right top corner is annoying as it feels like a icon on the full screen unless you are used to it. Comes with a plastic back case. Slightly bigger than so. The packaging was good but I found a mark/scratch on screen right on opening the box which was a let down. I hear that it comes with a screen guard prepplied.  This is end of production with s20 in the market now. So I hit the 30% discount price. Not a big difference from my s8.

"
"

  This phone is obviously a killer in every way right from performance to price! I think it is better than S10+ because of how compact it fits in hand and that circular cutout. Everything is excellent may it be performance or camera..but there are two things that are bothering me is 1. Battery runs out of charge easily if u use it in 2k resolution. using it in 1080p just helps. Still battery should have been better. 2. It bothers the pubg lovers..everyother game plays so well with no lag at high settings...but when it comes to pubg it really struggles even at low settings.it is not gpu fault. the optimization is to be done from tencent. This issue with Exynos S10 and S10+ has been long lasting and not yet resolved...if you don't believe me search for ""pugb issues on exynos S10"" on Google and you will know it

"
"

  Phone is very premium and feature packed.>Camera quality is excellent, but still lacks the quality we get from iPhone/Pixel’s  images.>Performance is top notch as it has a flagship processor.>OneUI is very smooth and I encountered very rare lags and glitches during my 2 months of use.I am receiving monthly updates and security patches.>Battery life is good only.I am getting 5-5.5 hrs of SOT.>Recently,camera quality got improved with updates especially night mode.>Speaker quality is Outstanding and I think no other phone has a speaker sounding like this. Call quality and reception is also excellent.Finally,you should get this phone if want a feature-packed experience with no compromises  on any feature and experience the standard-ness of SAMSUNG

  This product is in complete contrast with 2020 products on following accounts: Battery, Camera specification, Screen size, Weight. However, other than the battery, I think on all other parameters it should be preferable over any other 2020 product.6 inch screen size with a great screen to body ratio makes it very compatible and handy. I don't think huge screens actually provide any significant better viewing experience considering the inconvenience they carry along.Cameras though 12MP are far better than any 64MP camera, there is no gimmick and its all a practical camera set.157 grams is too light and again makes it very convenient to handle it, while most other phones are ranging 180-220 grams.Yes, in an era of 7000MAH battery, 3400 is actually low. However I compensated for it by using some recommended settings and using a wireless charger thats the parking place whenever I m at home and not using my phone. In the current time, when we are mostly home, this is a con that I am able to manage well.I got the phone at 32K with exchange and I am pretty satisfied with the buy.

"
"

  Absolute garbage. Received a faulty piece. Now this was suppose to be a gift to my wife on her birthday, turned out to be quite an opposite of that. The device I received will simply not load the setup and keeps restarting every now and then. Well I’ve asked for the replacement, Amazon better don’t not replace it from the same seller.

"
"

  Please replace my s10 because Betty is very weak please exchange those product

"
"

  Everything is awesome about this device except the battery life which last for around 18-20 hours on a normal usage.Overall best purchase in 40-45k with perfect screen size.Build quality 10/10Camera 10/10Display 10/10Audio 9/10Battery 6/10

"
"

  Worst phone i had ever seen everything in this phone is below the mark.phone heating so much

"
"

  Samsung , pls fix your stuff . When I'm buying a phone  that costs 50k+ , it better be worth it . When it comes to perfomance,  it's actually pretty good but there are other flag ships with wayyy better performance.  Battery life is the worst . EVER. Even after many updates , they were unable to fix the battery drain problem on the exynos variants . ( which is an inferior processor compared to the one being sold in the us , the snapdragon) . The camera and display are phenomenal! Everything else including the ui feel smooth with occasional legs here and there

"
"

  Hi...i am not satisfied with the working of the phone there is some problem with the touch sensors.Pls help me return this phone .It is only one day above the return closing window date as i could only operate my phone after 16th as i was not in the city.Kindly consider my case as an exception.Thanks and Regards

"
"

  Well.. Honestly its my first flagship samsung mobile after I ditched one plus 7t (No chinese mobile ever). First impression.. Just wow!! Samsung is really Samsung when we talk about the display quality. I just looked few times every day to the display only without doing any activity on the phone. Apart from display it had glass finish back which give premium looks to the phone. One UI gives a good & clean android experience. Also after Samsung announced 3year service for Android & security updates it already make android 12 guaranteed which is awesome 👌. Only one bad thing I noticed that it drained battery a lot.I need to charge minimum one time to keep it 💯.. Though battery usage can drastically reduced by changing display from qhd to fhd but again what's the point if I dont get that colorful & crisp display when using a flagship. Lastly it satisfy my security concerns which I didn't get on chinese mobile.Overall Its a good 👍 phone to use on 2020 if you don't want to spend 70 to 80k on s20+ or s20 ultra.

  Disclaimer: Consider my review with the fact in mind that I'm a moderate user and I don't play heavy games or stream too much content on this device.---I purchased this device during the Prime Day sale and got for Rs. 37,000 with exchange, which is a great price for an S10. I had a some concerns, but since using this phone for a week now I can put them to rest:- Fingerprint sensor: This had mixed reviews so I was skeptical about its speed and reliability, but at least for me the sensor has been working flawlessly and its been very quick to register my fingerprint. I was quite surprised about this.- Battery life: I'm getting around a day and a half of battery life. I'm a moderate user though, and the screen on time I get is between 5.25 to 5.75 hours, sometimes even up to 6 hours (all on FHD+ resolution) so I'm happy with that.- Cameras: the cameras are excellent and a big step up from the mid-ranger (A50) I was using before- Heating: Like I said, I'm a moderate user; I more or less exclusively use WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, Reddit, Boost so I haven't encountered any heating issues. The phone gets a little warm to the touch when doing a lot of things, like updates and playback/video recording simultaneously, but it never gets hot.- Speed: For what I do, the Exynos 9820 is more than adequate. The UI is snappy and responsive, apps open instantly, no loading screens or jitter, and 8GB of RAM is adequate enough for all the apps in my recents to be in memory and not requre reloading.

"
"

  You can not say enough about the screen, it's just too good. This is the best screen I have seen period, be it on a TV, monitor or a phone. If you watch a lot of movies or videos on your phone it's the best phone you can have.Other than that, you can expect all the other flagship quality features from the phone like the camera and battery life. The phone is very light, very comfortable to use. The UI is cleaner as well. You can not go wrong with this phone.

"
"

  This is my initial review of unpacking the phone.After opening the Boxed phone and pulling out the phone found white spots with fine grains like substance sticking on the body of phone both front and back . Like someone has packed the phone with unwashed hand .On the front screen have taken shot with black background(mobile) intentionally to highlight the details.

"
"

  Well, well, well,I've watched too many tech reviews on YouTube includingMKBHD, Technical Guruji, jerryRig everything, supersaf, mrwhostheboss,..................................Well this list is too longEverything is supper good no problem at allDisplay is too good as it's ""Dynamic AmoLED"" not ""Super AmoLED"".Camera is awesome 4k @60fpsReverse wireless charging supportBut but butWhat makes me disappointed is battery lifeIn one day, i have to charge phone minimum 2 timesIt takes 1 minute to charge 1% at the end it takes more than 100 minutes to charge like 110 or 120 minutesIt means I've to wait 4+ hr in a day...Which is li'l bit disappointing.Well, if battery is not a problem for u can go for it.That's it..

"
"

  Very good processor. It is very fast, can play any advanced graphics game. Very poor battery life. Also finger print reader is also not that effective. Have to press multiple times.

"
"

  well it got delayed by six days because of lockdown in west bengal, but the product is absolutely awesome..i had lot of apprehensions as i had ordered mobile online for the first time , payment was already made.  but i did lot of research for authenticity , duplicity etc.. but Samsung Galaxy S10 i ordered is original and working awesome....i would say that i would do similar online purchases in future from AMAZON....

"
"

  This is samsungs premium mobile but after this. I am disapointing so much. Camera is looking like oppo vivo mobiles camara. Battery backup is worst. And some heating issue. I don't know these problems i only facing or other coustomer also facing.

"
"

  Very good quality phone. But unfortunately phone started malfunctioning from 3rd of September. Charging port was not working. Eventually gave phone to Samsung service centre on 4th evening. As per them charging port needs to be replaced. Really disappointed with Amazon & Samsung. If a new flagship phone performs in this way how could we trust the brand. I don’t want to write anything negative, just a request please check quality of every product before selling. Presently my new phone is in service centre. Hopefully problem will be fix by them. Let see. Otherwise I need to contact with Amazon & Samsung for the solution.

"
"

  I am an i-phone user since 2010, now i bought samsung for first time and i am amazed with this s10. i was worried that i m gonna miss apple's luxery, but i was wrong. This S10 is way more cool than apple 11. must buy thing!

"
"

  Reliable, efficient, high quality camera, great resolution & a good capacity - a very good phone if you want a phone that is both reliable and comes with high end performance. I lost my S10 last year and purchased this one again - that's how much I like it.

"
"

  A beautiful phone imagined by Samsung. They have  always been making very practical phones and S10 is no different. I have got the S10 varient. There are a few things yu have to keep in mind before buying it.This is a flagship device with mediocre battery life. Lasts 1 day with medium usage. Camera and other things are spot on. Usage is smooth is monor stutters here and there. They are still working on stabalising this phone completely.My point : If yu want a bigger battery go for the S10+ or else sticking with the S10 will be fine.

"
"

  Excellent phone .But there are some heating issues.Android 10 update available now. Battery lasts a day if usage is minimal. Overall one of the best android phones available in the market. But the price is little bit higher side compared to similar types of popular brand phones. I hope that the price would be reduced when galaxy s20 enter into market.

"
"

  As of now if u want a perfect phone ... just go for it!Camera is mindblowing.(if u see it with a phone camera perspective)Sound quality through speakers and 3.5mm jack is great tooFingerprint reader is a 8/10  it is quick but u need to place the finger very accurately on the sensor. But overall it works fine ... turn on face and fingerprint lock together and u r good to goGaming ... it's simply free flowing...pubg is a joy on this device ...ya iPhones shine there with 1/2 of a second...they are faster in gaming...no big deal though.Call quality  is great.  Network reception is awesome too.Battery life...on a typical usage. It would last a day.  I started using it at 9:00am with 95% of battery and it lasted till 9pm for meThe usage includes  30 -40 mins of gaming camera usage other social networking apps and everything else which u would ever use on a typical day.I faced a bit of heating. not a lot but it gets slightly warm on the back if battery is low and usage is heavy.  But that too is not. a huge thing...

"
"

  Switched from Apple 6 to this one, loving the phone interface, beautiful screen and amazing camera. Battery life is ok, can run uptown 24 hours without any charging and with full usage.

"
"

  Received damaged product!!There's a small screen damag (black mark)on the left side of the screen.Didnt expect this after paying huge amount of money 45k.Also the mobile box I received was without plastic covering!Now I doubt if they have given me a refurbished one!The phone was working  totally fine! But I can't accept a phone with damaged screen!

"
"

  The phone look stunning...display quality is amazing in this price range and also the camera , all are perfectly good the only thing I found that the battery backup is poor..... its draining very fast and also the packing, its just kept in the package with no protection

"
"

  Very Happy with phone . loving it

"
"

  Battery life is a bit low otherwise best phone in market right now.

"
"

  Returned just due to Poor battery life and Very slow charging Disappointed at thus cost such a poor battery life and No Fast charge

"
"

  Superb android beast with really impressive camera. Comfortable to hold and operate thanks to its compact design.Display quality of  the screen is awesome.Stereo speakers produce great Dolby atoms sound. Front camera takes nice photos in all three modes with all natural like colours. Night mode is really superb. Super slow motion videos are fun to watch.Little bit disappointed with the battery side as it could have been better. Fingerprint reader is somewhat slow to detect.Overall a superb masterpiece phone for camera lovers.

"
"

  Just awesome..the phone is rightly sized and absolutely mind blowing camera. I have used iPhoneX as well but feel this one comes close in terms of camera & stands out because of its price value. Build quality is good don't get fooled by its glass body, have been using it without case, the phone comes with the glass scratch shield which can be removed later. I love it as truly meets the expectation from a flag ship offering from Samsung.Just go for it you would not regret!!

"
"

  Awesome phone for everything only battery is little bit weak for high gaming users normal users not have any issue cameras ,display, speed,everything have 5star buy without any doubt

"
"

  Pros : Spectacular display  : Lightening speed  : Unbeatable Features (Power Sharing,Wireless Charger)  : Light weight  : Elegant Design  :  4K recordingPros : Battery Life.(battery keep draining without using anything)  :  In-display ultrasonic finger print sensor .(Not accurate many times.U can't use normal screen protector.)

"
"

  Best device in galaxy series by Samsung, one of best smartphone in 2019. The screen is awesome and the new oneUi of samsung is really nice and you won't miss stock android in oneUI.

"
"

  other features are okayoneplus 7 pro would be best in this rangereally battery draining a lot, slow fingerprint sensor, camera quality very ordinary, display not upto mark for video streaminggood dolby audio but low bassthere is powershare but you need some other power source to chargeregret after buying but only benefit is the Samsung tag

"
"

  I am using it for around 2 months and everything looks great. I switched from ios to android after 8 years and I do not regret it. Initially i was having issues with the fingerprint sensor, but after a system update everything is ok. The look and feel of the phone is so nice. I am using ringke screenguard with a spigen case.

"
"

  Battery backup is worst , and i can’t avail my April offer.

"
"

  The perfect Android phone.Good things:1. Superb display2. Well improved OS3) Best design4) camera is superb just for non person thingsBad things:1) front camera very poor, too soft image like vivo oppo2) even rear camera with person is poor ( only good for natural things)

"
"

  I was skeptical about the product as there was no plastic packaging outside the box due to which there were some fine dust particles inside the box contents. Talking about the phone is good camera is best in class front camera is average Battery backup is below average maximum 6 hours Sot with light usage .Performance is top notch. Even with dark mode,animations disabled and all battery consuming things turned off the battery backup is not good.

"
"

  I have been using this mobile past 1 month. I am giving 1* to fingerprint reader, most of the time it is asking to press again and header.  and face unlock is also not much impressive mostly its unable to detect.Rest of feature are very good, camera quality is super.

"
"

  The Beast with Low Battery BackupIf we talk about Features no one can beat This phone bt issue is only with battery backup .I don't understand why Samsung has given this much low capacity battery with such a great phone.Overall 4 star ... one star less for battery backup.

"
"

  Please don’t buy....!This product is waste of money as we just started 2-3 days and now phone stared heating from back side while playing video  even when i reached to customer care they suggest trouble shooting n all

"
"

  Writing after 15 days of use. Everything works superbly, delivery was also lightening fast. The only concern here is battery life, they should have provided atleast 4000mAH. It remains nearly 30% in the evening, after you fully charge it in the morning.Thereby deducting one star for battery life.

"
"

  Stunning display n camera but horrible battery back up, gets very hot after playing 10-20 mins pubg/asphalt. 15w watt charger is average ,could have been better considering price point , it's not worth paying extra premium

"
"

  Screams ""premium"" every way you look at it. Nothing to complain about. This is one gorgeous gadget! Amazon delivered it in just over 24 hours and that's the icing on the cake.

"
"

  In 2020 still one of the best phones to buy. Excellent built quality with metal frame and smooth glass on both sides. Not 90hz but super sharp and accurate display with 1440p. Great camera setup. Battery is a bit weak and may feel warm to touch on heavy use. You'll struggle to find good screen guard

"
"

  The phone is fantastic in terms of:1. UI2. Display3. Camera4. Performance5. HandyOne thing that am not satisfied with is Battery. I use the mobile for less than 5 hours (in 24 hours). But still I have to charge it everyday. I wish I just had to charge it 2 days once.

"
"

  Update 17/7/20Still using the phone and going great. The fingerprint scanner still gives me hard times sometimes. Other than that, Going strong so far.–-------+++++++-------The fingerprint scanner is a nightmare. Camera is pretty good. Display is awesome. Battery life could have been made better. Overall decent phone.

"
"

  Worst phone a person can have in 62k

"
"

  Worst phone I ever used.from day one security pattern is not working.not expected from a flagship mobile from samsung.horrible!!!!I pure waste of money

"
"

  This phone is just perfect for the price I purchased it. It has an amazing camera, perfect size - fits in my hand perfectly - it's not as big as other phones these days, decent battery life and a good processor. The phone looks and feels absolutely amazing!!!! Not to mention how amazing the screen looks!

"
"

  M using this phn frm last 5 days and charger is nt cnnctng prprly. I cnt replace bcoz i dn't hv amazon packing. M nt satisfied 😑

"
"

  Starting from the camera it is awesome is good lighting condition but used to struggle at low lights but now after the recent update it can see in dark with much less noise.The fingerprint is something not to be very proud of i found it to be a bit inconsistentRAM management and overall speed is good.Overall it's good deal an a complete pakage

"
"

  Best Mobile I Have After S7 edge am Very Happy With This Phone....

"
"

  Its size and design is superb. Its light wt and can be operated with one hand. Phone is fast and I haven't come across performance or heating issues.Picture quality is good. Battery lasts a day even after good use.

"
"

  Light weight , classy look , good camera quality , as name indicate it's a true Samsung premium phone ...

"
"

  Ordered on prime day sale, received it today.Excellent build quality, the screen is a treat to the eye with the qhd dynamic amoled display, amazing cameras, received 2 major updates so far, the security patch is of 1 August 2020.Only one con... the battery drainExcellent packaging by the seller, and timely delivery by Amazon.

"
"

  Loving the product, Fingerprint scanner is too good and camera qualityis amazing. Best buy in 2020 as well since its an year old product. Got it delivered on time and the delivery guy was very nice and honest. He did not mind me recording a video of me opening the package even before I gave him the otp for receiving the package.

"
"

  Performance is so great...but one little problem which are battery draining is very fast otherwise everything is superb 💥💥💥💥Ek hi mobile mai sab kuch nhi milta dosto....

"
"

  Phone quality is awesome very handy phone very slim display is brilliant...fingerprint scanner is not that fast but its quite accurate and secured...Camera is just awesome videos photos are shoots exceptionally well..Battery is ok not charging that fast like oneplus  cellphone...

"
"

  Best phone I've ever used. The phone is great for one handed use despite having a large screen. Display is aweosme. Only have a problem with battery life as it is not enough for a heavy user like me.

"
"

  This is just what i hoped for.. Screen quality is just best in the business  and the sound quality  will just take your heart away its too good..Not sure with battery life may be it justs when it understands  my usage

"
"

  mobile looks good,  compact design, for normal usage battery stands for whole day. Finger print not working good.

"
"

  I love my phone. It's got everything it promises and more! Only thing I worry about is how delicate it is.. so far so good!! It's been 5 months and going strong.

"
"

  Can't stop gazing at this piece. Everything is so perfect till now. Only problem when I tried for power sharing to my moto 360 watch it showed me a pop up "" phone is too hot please try after it cools down"" and it auto stopped the dock charging of my watch in just 5 mins. I also realised that phone was heated up indeed.

"
"

  The best decision I've ever taken for a mobile. Completely satisfied with the amazing device. No problems what so ever. There is only one glitch I face though, the screen is too sensitive and sometimes it reads the fingers or palm while watching movies or playing games and minimises the screen.

"
"

  when I forgot to my password to unlock the handset I had to visit service centre and wait for one and half hour to get the handset opened , which is ridiculous there needs to be some way out made available to do it by the owner on his own as forgetting password can be normal problem

"
"

  Finger print reader is good and the camera quality is also very good. But battery life is not that great.  Some times I see it getting stuck

"
"

  Great phone, when new it didn't support Google lens. But after few updates now I'm able to get it.Brought my phone 3 months back and never faced any issue.Just wish the fingerprint reader worked as good as the physical button.

"
"

  Overall, it is a good product, the downside I found is that it gets hot very quickly when watching videos on Youtube.

"
"

  Extremely disappointed with the camera quality/performance.A big no if someone wants to buy this phone for camera.My old S9 plus clicks even far better pics.

"
"

  Over all a perfect  phone for 2020  without  no doubt thank you Amazon

"
"

  Average product  guys  , display is superb  , elegant,  but not much battery  life , if you previously used one plus phones then this phones UI will look bad and you will find it small  , sound quality is good , camera is superb  but overall average phone .

"
"

  Product not good. Gets heated up. Very poor life of Battery.I want to return it. How it can be done.

"
"

  Disappointed as the phone is getting stuck and heats up very fast in few hours of purchase.

"
"

  Well its absolutely fine and great but not sure why I got the ear phone of some other company by name AKG instead of a Samsung ear phone

"
"

  Pros:Phone feels very premiumcameras perform very wellCons:Fingerprint reader sucksBattery life is average, as too many unwanted samsung processes

"
"

  Pros:1. Great Screen2. Good Camera3. Premium FeelCons:1.Battery not suitable for a Gamer. Will do good for an office professional

"
"

  Amazing screen ratio, Screen resolution, and battery life. If you put the phone on max battery power saving mode, you can easily go more than 40 hrs with it.

  The phone has a major heating issueAlthough I had read the comments about the heating issue, I didn't take it seriously..But the issue is really serious......It gets like boiling withing the use of half an hour , rest the phone is good

"
"

  Beautiful in itself, apart from battery use everything works like a charm, screen, sound, camera, in ear sound, performance everything is so perfect.

"
"

  Superb display.....Excellent build quality. Performance was pretty good but snapdragon will be better option. Battery life will be better. The only one drawback is battery till I observed and everything is good.

"
"

  Absolutely slow finger print reader... really disappointed

"
"

  Value for money.I have used S4, S6 , S7, S8 & now S10.  Only grievance is that the prices of the samsung flagship drops way to low inexcess of 30k within a year of launch . One who buys it just when launched feel cheated.

"
"

  Display awesome 👌Camera 1st grade quality ☝️Fingerprint works well 👍Battery good enough for normal users, but not for heavy users 🤏

"
"

  The fingerprint reader is pretty accurate, but it doesn't recognize fingerprints if fingers are wet or dirty, contrary to what many people think. Everything else on the S10 though is top class, no compromises anywhere, no corners cut.

"
"

  The device looks beautiful in white. Overall performance is great bt not perfect. Ultimate display quality better color saturation.  Gaming experience is good but can be better like in other device like one plus 7. Battery quality is better in s10 plus.

"
"

  Great Compact , Premium is Premium,  good for hold aand handy, initially it was heating too much and post a recent update no issue

"
"

  Very bad product. It heats up to 45 degree.battery life few hours .amazone exchange policy is not good

"
"

  Amazing device works like a charm. Being my first flagship purchase it could not have got better

"
"

  Over all good performance but i think price is high for mobile.

"
"

  Awesome phone. Great camera,premium looks. But battery quality is not good enough. Overall its a good flagship phone.

"
"

  Mobile has awesome features, though screen is 6 inch or so, easy to handle. Touch sensitivity is great and display is also great. New things are battery may not come for an entire day if you are continuous 4G data user.

"
"

  Completely Happy with the purchase.Note: upgraded from S8

"
"

  Excellent phone, only heating problem.

"
"

  Nice, stylish, sleek but you can get similar feature phone in far lesser price with other brand.

"
"

  Everything its just unbelievable but price is high but ur getting lots of things so super

"
"

  The cameras and display is exceptional. And the feel is pretty premium too. But performance is not what you would expect from a phone this expensive and the current flagship.

"
"

  Wonderful phone from Samsung. Excellent screen 👌 love Samsung pay and reverse charging.Battery could have been better.

"
"

  Very good phone. A bit issue withthe battery life as it drains out prety fast. Camera is awesome.

"
"

  Poor battery life Figerprint less effectiveCamera quality goodDisplay owesomeSize very handySound digital dolbyPerformance very goodStorage goodFaceunlock goodBetter than iPhoneOver all go for it 👍

"
"

  All 5 starts....but battery should have been 4k mah atleast

"
"

  One of best mobile to buy in 2020. Battery life is very ordinary if your are ok with battery life one of beast mobile and User Experience is far better than OnePlus mobiles.

"
"

  Awesome phone with great camera and display.. only issue is with the battery as it drains quickly and fast charging is not that fast as u compare it to one plus.

"
"

  Battery drains fast.... camera quality is excellent.... fingerprint sensor is very poor...... look was very nice.... touch is very smooth....... and over all performance of this phone is very good

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is slow and can't detect sometimes

"
"

  Camera, display and performance are great. Battery is okay. Front camera is average.

"
"

  The performance of this devjce is extremely impressive...in love

"
"

  Phone is looking nice and operating very well. i like the extra ordinary features of the phone.

"
"

  Its my 3rd flagship phone in the span of last 7 year started from note 2 then s7 edge n now s10... very happy with the phone after using since last 3 months. Looking for more innovative and exciting products from samsung..

"
"

  The manufacturing date was 14 months old... so a bit disappointed. it is brand new and good but somehow a recent manu date helps..

"
"

  Great cameras,light weight,display is too gud,great performance,better than iPhone xr just go for it😎

"
"

  Battery is not good. Front camera not worth. Looks on point. Rear camera awesome

"
"

  It's not an unlocked sim and it doesn't show in the description Amazon needs to take more information before showing product here , it's a full time process to return the mobile and to get the refund ..

"
"

  I was an iphone user , i switched to this phone ,believe me its worth switching ,everything is great i  this phone

"
"

  Good smartphone but battery should be upgraded

"
"

  This is very great product because of super specifications. Awesome product. I am very happy because i was not disappointed with the money which i spend on it.

"
"

  Fingerprint print reader and front camera is not upto my expectations(selfies are amazing but AI kicks in a lot). But the phone is loaded with features. I'm in love.

"
"

  Charging point has become non functional within 3 weeks. With company provided charger, it is taking 5 hours to charge fully.Poor quality of workmanship. I want to return

"
"

  The screen gaurd was damaged

"
"

  An awesome product

"
"

  Poor battery backup

"
"

  Battery backup is not goodBut overall phone and camera is superb

"
"

  Performance is not so great.  Phone is slow. I had to restart the phone 3-4 times as the phone stopped responding. Not worth paying the money.

"
"

  Overall phone is good but battery quality is very poor. Its below average. If your use is normal then you have to charge at least two times in a day.

"
"

  Amazing camera , Great Quality of Pictures and lots of features available

"
"

  Phone is good, No complaint about it. But I need an invoice of my phone which I did not get the time of delivery. Please provide the invoice at the earliest.

"
"

  Samsung s10 is very light weight and fast. INFACT it is very convenient to use. ALL in One... All rounder.

"
"

  With exchange, and other offers combined for it at 37k. Great phone.

"
"

  GOOD phone at right price

"
"

  Battery backup very poor

"
"

  Camera quality is very good, still could have added more features and increased MP.Battery life is fair enough. In general, samsung at it's best!!

"
"

  Camera and screen is too good. Unfortunately battery drains very fast. Overall good performance so far. Atleast it should have 4000mh battery.

"
"

  One of the best premium  quality mobile with really great experience. Thanks Amazon to put such great offer to us

"
"

  But not include invoice

"
"

  First impression is really good. But after 2 days battery backup is not do great. Otherwise it is wonderful. Great display

"
"

  A great phone within the new price range... Go for it..

"
"

  Beautifully made fits perfectly in hand , lagfree performance , excellent quality , well priced in sale !

"
"

  Poor oximeter and health sensor.... it's only dummy featureI compare more time.... Samsung Galaxy s10 always fail to read right oxygen level...

"
"

  Good phone

"
"

  Camera is awesome... battery life is low

"
"

  Awesome performance. Samsung concentrated more on phone but the quality of charging cable is way below expectations. All others too good and I'm loving this phone

"
"

  Battery is not up to the mark and 15w fast charging is not enough for full high end mobile..

"
"

  It would have been full 5 if the battery didn't started to heat up after gaming or heavy usage. Also tge charging speed is bit slow.

"
"

  It would've been perfect smartphone if battery performance was good. Everything is just perfect except battery. Just an average battery.

"
"

  Not as per the shown in order.Battery 4100mah but it is 3400mahRam  8gb but it is 3gbWhy Amazon doing this.

"
"

  Soo good

"
"

  Go for it... The camera, powerful performance & best ever display experience!

"
"

  Amazing, nice to hold, good performance.

"
"

  Still the best 👌

"
"

  phone is great but battery life is ok for a flagship. You should go for s10 plus unless you are getting s10 for less than Rs 45000

  Fingerprint reader takes time, camera qualty good, Battery life worse, maximum 45mins if you play any video

"
"

  Superb display and camera. Beats any phone out there and relevant in 2020!

"
"

  The picture quality of images clicked from rear camera are blurry and not sharp. Pictures taken from my Samsung M30 are way better

"
"

  Product is very good. Camera is awesome. Battery last 1 to 2 days.

"
"

  Overall its a good purchase

"
"

  Good phone and I ordered the watch greatttt

"

  Got it from Store Retailer in Chennai on 6th of March 2019 But still, Cudnt Hold Myself from posting this review!!PROS:1. Excellent Display and Saturation...rated A+ in displaymate2. Extremely smooth and polished enough to hold and use3. One UI is absolutely fantastic and much Intuitive4.exteremely well-built and lite weight..can't help but wonder how they made it under 160gms.. s9and s9+ were both above 180 gms..5.tri camera setup lives upto its hype..feels glorious6. Radical design with punch hole camera..Feast your eyes on this beauty7. ultrasonic fingerprint is snappy..CONS:1. Need to put in a case ASAP.. or if u want to show off ur s10 with no case/cover then better buy urself a mobile protection package..2.ultrasonic fingerprint scanning is limited to a certain screen area and u have to ensure that u properly keep ur finger on it..3. Camera quality, especially at low lights, feels a bit oversaturated and artificial4. Battery life is a debatable topic on one's daily needs.. i found it lasting for 7 hrs with 4G switched on!!BOTTOMLINEU CANT AFFORD TO MISS THIS ONE ..THIS IS A FULL FLEDGED PACKAGE WITH THE BEST SAMSUNG HAS TO OFFER IN SUCH A GLORIOUS DESIGN..HAIL THE KING OF 2019!!!!

"
"

  Was really hoping for the snapdragon processor to be present but unfortunately it's not. Its frustrating we Indians pay so much for ""phones"" only to not get the best out there. Whereas in the US you definitely pay less and even more cheaper if with a contract and get so much more. Sucks, on Samsung's part as well. Probably gonna wait on the OnePlus 7 now. S10/+ disappointed me :/

"
"

  The display and camera is really the best. Performance  is really good. Software is user-friendly and phone is light weight. The only drawback I faced is battery drain. It doesn't  last more than 8-9hrs of usage(Office time). I have to carry a power bank everyday. Hoping that next software update might fix this.

"
"

  I am using Samsung devices from galaxy s3 - 2012. Samsung had improved so much in camera but they are restricting some features in camera.Camera:- Very nice camera and night photography is also nice. Slow Mo is awesome on this phone.What i disliked is the shutter speed in pro mode. There is still same settings like 10 sec max open shutter time. Samsung needs to improve it to 30sec plus.For night photographer like me, it needs some pro features like auto shutter timers, night time lapses video must be improved.If you liked my review, please prees helpful button.Thanks.

"
"

  Never go for samsung flagship smartphone in india these days..Becoz the processor is the  of weakest point of the phoneIf you pay 60000+ plus for the performance phone ... you never get the performance same as you pay... After a year when warranty expires you smartphone will go to disturb you.... And the biggest point waterproof... Is the only for name.... It's not real waterproof... Yesterday my s7 shows messege for remove moisture before plug charger... But there was no moisture .... And when I go service centre they say the charging port is damage.. due to liquid .... If liquid damage your smartphone... Where is waterproofing.... And so much lag... And another side mi note 4 with same 4gb ram ... No lag No frame drop but in samsung  so much ...... Samsung Only cutting our pocket... Not justify the price of their product.... Namaste Ram Ram

"
"

  I got the S10 white exynos variant as my birthday gift from my wife, I was excited due to the amazing reviews provided for the phone from critics however the excitement was short lived due the the horrible idle drain time. If you get a american snapdragon variant than you don't have to worry, however exynos Indian version is horrible. I have to charge twice a day even if i keep the phone on idle and using the lowest resolution, if you turn on ultra HD mode the phone heats up , worst part is the battery drains even in the Maximum power saving mode.I called up Samsung support care twice, Even the Samsung support person wasn't helpful. He disconnected the phone call and never bother for a call back. Unlike the S7Edge models there is no premium home pickup service for you device, you have to go the service store. My older S7 edge has poor battery drain and i moved to 5T. After the amazing reviews I saw i thought s10 had a good idle time but its horrible. Please don't get this phone, if you don't trust my experience there are a lot of users on google who reported the same on exynos S10 device. I wouldn't lie, Screen is beautiful. I have a colleague who got a S10plus and its battery is very good, he gets a one whole day. so please either get a S10 Snapdragon variant or go with S10 plus or even better wait for S10 NOTE OR ONE plus 7.note :- Camera lens are very poorly built and they are prone to tear and scratches if you place along key-chain or a phone.- getting a working finger print shatter proof screen guard is nothing short of a mobile store visit adventure

"
"

  I am using S10 indian version from 8th March.The major 3 problems i have  areBiggest one--Battery last max 9 hrs with Normal usage**NO SNAPDRAGON 855 SOC FOR INDIA BUT EXYNOS!Gets heated alot easily while even using inbuilt appsGreat features are1.DISPLAY is out of world..2.Camera setup front & back.3.Audio output on both speaker & Headphones.4.Wireless charging.5.IP 68 certified.6.One UI.7.secure folders feature.8.Easy to hold & use due to size.9.AKG headphones inbox.10.Light weight.11. Gorgeous Looks..!I hope battery issue will be fixed soon with software Updates.

"
"

  Great rich and vivid display. Low light photographs are excellent. Battery is  disappointing, hope it improves with update. Will update more details post usage.

"
"

  I hope below review will suffice everything.I got delivery on next day. Such a fast delivery thanks for Amazon. Samsung promised to give 3 years continuous updates and trust me in coming few months this phone will be a beast interms of performance.As soon as I got the phone I put in front of god and opened after hour.What I experienced was superb design, elegant classy look. Screen quality is a beast. No one can compete with the screen quality. There is hardly any difference between the screen resolution between S10 and S20 so why to pay heavy price. Earlier I was using Samsung M30S so compared to that screen size of S20 is just 3 inches small. But trust me it's more comfortable in holding the phone in hand.Lot of people are mentioning battery issues. Now it depends on the actual purpose you wish to have. For gaming there are asus phones hence this phone is definitely not built for gaming. Also you can set the resolution to 1080p FHD mode in order to get more battery. But I don't have any complaints as I easily got one day battery backup. Make sure phone software should be up to date to get most of the latest usage.Camera is the best in class trust me. Compared to S20 which is 22 to 25,000 more S10 is definitely worth purchasing. So why to pay such heavy price for small differences. Camera improved a lot after updates. 1.5 aperture is best in low light. We always edit photos and after editing results will be the fantastic. Don't go with YouTube reviews, once you use the product then you will easily find the way to make the best of camera.Exynos version is definitely a disappointment for most of customers but this is what it is.  In terms of performance I have not noticed any kind of lags.No heating issues as I observed, make sure your phone is updated to latest software and as I said this phone is not a purely gaming phone hence you may find heating issues in excess use of gaming. But in my day to day usage I didn't find any issues.So overall I didn't find any scope for complaints. For day to day usage, camera, app handling, calls everything work smoothly.

"
"

  It's a average phone, not worth the price. Really disappointed. There is something really wrong with Samsung. Camera quality and battery life really bad. Never thought a 60k phone would be this pathetic. Takes 1 hr and 45 mins to charge from 0 to 100, battery life is less than a day(sometimes only 6 to 8 hrs).Camera is too bright, photos doesn't look real, too much noise.I was using oneplus 3 before, wonderful phone and it charges in less than 1 hr and the charge comes for 1.5 days.Only pros about S10 is Finger print reader, face lock and screen quality.My advice is don't buy this phone, don't fall for advertisements and their paid reviews online. IPhone xr and oneplus 7 pro are much much better, worth buying them. You will definitely regret if you buy S10

"
"

  Flipkart is selling this same mobile for 43k on this same day.... This is not at all a prime day saleMobile is good but Amazon is charging more for it

"
"

  The moisture detected issue will drive you to insanity. Google it and you'll know.  The only solution to this is to replace the motherboard which is 21k.  And this happens with most of the S10s.  Also read Samsung official blogs.

"
"

  I have used it for 13 days so far, so far i am enjoying my shift to android from iphone (except some apps are weird on android like WhatsApp, copying text from anywhere is not possible on android)Camera: didnt used it extensively but so far so goodBattery: it's just fine better than my iPhone 6s but not great, it won't die during the day even with mediun to heavy use (just beware of pubg on this device)Performance: day to day tasks are breeze and samsung have come a long way with it's one ui which is great compared to its previous uisGaming: here comes the real trouble- if you play pubg stay away from it, you can't even play at low settings, screen is so choppy and it's unplayable.... Iphone 6s was so smooth even at medium or high graphics, it heats a lot as well during pubg onlyOther games are fine, pubg is not optimized yet, will update my review after they resolve this issue.Design: it looks amazing especially the front with curved edges otherwise it will just look like any Chinese phone, it's not inconvenient at all as i expectedDisplay: simply gorgeous

"
"

  What a waste of money.. Spending that large amount and getting only 2.7 GHz processor... Even a 20k priced phone offers 2.83GHz processor.. Why is Samsung forcing us to use that out dated and underpowered exynos processors?

"
"

  The day I preordered this phone i was worried. I thought was i wasting my money as Samsung Phones are widely known for providing asian customers its low powered processors than the global edition of S10. But as soon as i received the phone i was awestruck.It was really an amazing looking phone and was really handy! My 2 flatmates had already bought S10+ and S10e amd i was supposed to bring their middle brother to complete the set and to be honest! it was one of the best looking yet sleek among the 3 ! it had more screen to body ratio than s10+ which gave it a bit edge! only thing that it lacked was battery life! but considering its 3300mah battery it gives quite a decent life! and not after almost 2 months of having this phone i am proud to say that i am one the most happy customer of S10! only issue i found that PUBG was getting a bit laggy since the start! so i did a little research and asked around and came into a conclusion that tencent have not optimised PUBG for exynos 9820 as there are only 3 phone that are having this processor! That's quite a dick move by tencent for not optimising the game! It's Camera is one of the best as Samsung is know for its camera! and its Samsung One OS is a Icebreaker! its quite efficient and gives the phone a premium edge! Hope my review is helpful for people looking to buy this amazing phone!

  Yes, it is nothing but the best and deserves the hype. It is not the most accurate fingerprint reader but it is forgivable since it portrays the future of smartphones. The screen as we have come to expect from Samsung is the best in it's class. Photography is taken care of by the impressive triple camera setup. The camera with its accomplish an excellent job while capturing memories even in low light. The wide angle lens with it's 120° of vision is one of the best in the industry.The telephoto camera captures moments with a 2x zoom. The 4000 mAh battery never fails to last for a whole day. The 10w wireless charging is fast and reliable.The 15w wired fast charge does not fail to charge the phone as fast as possible. The Exynos processor never fails to load the heaviest of games fast and reliably. The 8 gigabytes of RAM ensures that your gaming session is uncompromised. Overall the Samsung Galaxy S10+ is undoubtedly one of the very best in the industry.

  I purchased this in July, paying 50k, 23 days later I accidentally kept the phone on the dining table where a little bit of water was present since the table was a transparent glass I couldn't see the water 3 minutes later when I checked the phone I could see the water inside the rear camera. This astonished me since the phone has a IP68 rating of 8 for water resistance, I had an iPhone as well which was kept right next to it no issues with that phone one wipe and iPhone was ready. Boy Samsung device screen started flickering, flash light started flashing since i can't remove the battery I kept the phone to dry. It has been more than a month i still haven't got my phone fixed from the Samsung service center. I am very much disappointed in the quality of the device as the response I received from the Samsung customer care. Seams like I will never purchase a Samsung phone ever again cause of the trauma caused by this. never again Samsung Bye Bye.

  The phones nyc bt the mst imp problem is battery drain on this phone. Im a frequrnt traveller n need good batterylife the phone gives me 4 hrs sot im a heavy user n mst of d tym my phns on download. When my phones idle at nyt it consumed 16-20%. Which phones does that? Samsung has no solution for this. Nly exynos processors have this prob snapdragon ones dont have.

  This is coming from a Samsung and Apple Loyalist , so assess as you see fit.I have been a Samsung user for about 5 years now , and my relationship with Samsung began with S7 , Note 8 and now S10.Bought this device from Samsung outlet overseas due to very good offer.Pros :1) extremely good display. This is the THE BEST display you can get , period. Even the new S20 Ultra is not that much better per se.2) Has so much firepower , you will just glide through everything.3) Comes with Android one , the UI experience is Flawless.4) Next level camera and most importantly the Camera App. It flawlessly detects scenes and adjusts accordingly. To take Pro level shots you really dont need to be a pro.5) S10 especially , is very sleek and perfectly sized. Fits in pockets and palm perfectly and not bulky at all6) Music when played from loud speakers as well as earphones is so amazingMost important PRO of all :The Samsung DEX : This is seriously the NEXT LEVEL of Mobile phone. As in , you can connect your phone to the laptop /Desktop and use it just like a desktop.All my work related apps are in the phone but i like editing documetns in laptop. The DEX fixes this need in one fell Swoop. Seriously. Check it out , it really is NEXT LEVEL.Cons :1) Battery capacity is a little low , but then if you set the power management right and are not a super heavy user, lasts easily the whole day.2) Curved Display looks cool , but the screen protection glass is expensive and does come off.Note , i dont play any games in the mobile phone at all. Seriously , if you want the BEST Android has to offer , look no further than Samsung S/Note series.Also one piece of advise. Samsungs latest flagship vs the predecessors arent THAT different so always go for 1 version lower. It gives you the best of everything.

  This is my 6th Galaxy S series phone. The improvement in each iteration of series is simply awesome. The s10 is Simply the sexiest smartphone in the market. People will ask you which device is that. Just don't use silly cases and coversCamera is the best thing about the s10. Lowlight, daylight when the sun is blazing outside, raining; it just takes awesome photos. Special mention to the LOW LIGHT MODE.Speed of the phone is at ultra level god mode. Display is just a treat to one's eyes.Only if they can improve the battery life although its much better than my s8I didnot buy from amazon but u can definitely go for it

"
"

  Samsung phones have a bug where they delete photos from even google drive automatically.I have lost all my photos from 2006 - 2018. Google it online, and you will find this a common problem with samsung phones. No way to recover the photos if you dont realise it in time that all your saved photos have been deleted.

"
"

  The flagship that packs every feature from the best display ever made for a phone to the most versatile camera. ONE UI feels well made and cleaner with more focus to the one handed users. The exynos version is definitely inferior to the snapdragon variant but the different ain't very big. Bixby is still your unworthy sidekick but can be remapped easily. The excellent haptics with fine sound is a blessing. The finger print sensor takes a while to get used to but is pretty good. The reverse wireless charging is best if used for accessories like the buds or the watch which I personally use. Otherwise it's just a gimmick and fairly slow when Charing real phones. Battery is fairly good and lasted up to 20 hours with my heavy usage. In conclusion it seems like best flagship of 2019

  I made a switch from iphone 6s to Galaxy S10.. after 4 yrs of usage.. It felt strange and certain features still are better on iphone. ios is refined in many ways. But the reason to switch to Android was that I wanted to frequently copy content to my phone, like pictures, music, videos, movies.. etc.. installing many softwares outside the playstore.. all this was not possible in iphone, and I had to go through Itunes all the time. I had also bought a software called Simple transfer to copy files to iphone but not 100% effective. Finally.. after having used the S10 for 2 months, I feel its a great device with beautiful screen and great camera. The battery backup is also good. The OS could further be refined in many ways to make it more simpler.. The new OneUI on Samsung is smoother, better than the older Android versions.. Charging with the fast charge is awesome as it charges 50% in 30 mins..

  On the same day I got the phone, the glass covering the back camera broke. The phone was in ma pocket. I was using a phone cover. There was no keys or coins in ma pocket. I didn't expect this from a Samsung flagship. The glass is  so delicate. I submitted it for repair at the Samsung service centre. Now even they don't know whether they have spares for this . So who ever is buying this phone. Please consider this.

"
"

  I purchased this phone on 25 may its almost 6 months now the phone is super smooth till now there is no lag or hanging problem the display is one of the most beautiful point about this phone it is crisp, clear and bright with those amoled panel speaker is loud enough not the loudest but still one of the best i have used till now.But the battery backup is very poor i am hardly getting 3.5 hours of screen on time and other thing is that the fingerprint scanner it is working fine but not with the third party sellers tampered glass and it is having a good rear camera even though not as good as pixel phone but comparable with iphone xs but the selfie camera disappoints.

"
"

  samsung phones are now stuck with display discoloration issues. large number of users are affected by this after latest software updates. samsung has not yet resolved this. so kindly think twice before going with samsung.#im samsung note 9 user

"
"

  I bought it from store but i would like to tell my friends if you are spending above 50k+ probably you will disappoint with battery life and it heats in sun and while playing games like PUBG.

"
"

  Samsung mobile phones are now have no quility and not look back what they make. All s series phone have display problem a vrtical pink line is came on my glaxy s7 edge phone.screen. For that samsung services center told me display has to replace. That happened after 2 years. I checked online so many phone have same pink line problem

"
"

  Great phone but with a lot of battery drain s10  if you keep the display to FHD from QHD the battery life can improve a bit.great gaming experience,great camera,great display too. Very satisfied

"
"

  Didn't meet my expectations..camera is of poor quality...pics are coming like oppo or vivo....low light u can't take a pic...by evening 5 PM battery will be over even if u don't use heavily...have to carry a powerbank...totally disappointed with Samsung...my s6 edge was far better that this....pity myself spending somuch without waiting for reviews...

"
"

  Everything is best except battery life.Performance is also good. Overall best phone but as i said battery life don't even last 1 day i have to charge the phone twice a day.I want it fixed.Any suggestions?

"
"

  Samsung doesn't sell this phone with snapdragon processors in India, they put their own exynos processors. These exynos are 25 percent slower than snapdragon. There are many videos at youtube detailing this slowness.

"
"

  Product quality is good for a year.After that it gives some problem. As soon as the warranty of my phone expires its screen broke internally without any accident or fall. It happened with two of my devices both S10+ also the battery seems to be declining.

"
"

  I am very disappointed with this phone after using for only 40days, Fingerprints issue, Battery life is pathetic, and Touch screen feels like am i using a crap chinese phone( tired of accidental touches and touch wont work perfectly at edges and at fingerprint sensor area) and the price; when i bought it was 66900 and now it is 61900 and there are cashback offers which stops me reselling this phone in OLX and Quikr

"
"

  The mobile is overall quite nice, but the battery is huge let down. Samsung screwed this one big time. Charging speed is also slow. I have transitioned from moto g5 plus to samsung galaxy s10. The moto turbo charger was way better than the chager which s10 is providing. And battery is draining too quickly. Even on standby the battery is depleting at 5% per hour. And while screen is on, battery drain even faster than it charge.

"
"

  Exynos version heats up very fast and lag after 20 mins of gaming at low settings.....battery backup also bad...go for snapdragon varient oneplus..wayy better

"
"

  The Camera is great. Although the front camera has some inbuilt beautification which I hate a lot. Also the fingerprint scanner's area is not wide which sometimes makes it difficult to place correctly.And most importantly, Battery life isn't impressive at all.

"
"

  The best phone that u can buy in the current time..The biggest plus point is the display....wow its super amazing..u will be in the love at first sight with display...amazingly smooth one UI after a long time from samsung..no bugs till now..camera quality is superb..one of best portrait pics u will get on this phone..and non the less the design..it feels soo premium in hand..undoubtedly go for this device.

"
"

  It is discontinued model so not worth of buying for more than 35,000. Good camera phone. Battery won't last for whole day you need to charge it again for whole day use.

"

  Bought this phone recently..The camera is below average for a phone priced 50k.!!Battery life is just average.Don't waste your money on this.Honest review!!

  Camera,  is not at all great . It's less than average.  Please try once before purchasing. Front camera adds unwanted skin tone which makes overall picture more bad

  Samsung again proved it that they are best when it comes to screen quality. The phone has fabulous edge infinite display. Speed of the phone is mind blowing. Camera is big plus of this phone specially newly introduced wide angle lens.  Battery life is yet to be tested. Overall I am happy with the decision buying it.

"
"

  Below aspects are something that you will find ages to find fault and complain about.Build QualityPhone receptionSpeedUser InterfaceOnly drawback is the battery life...I use it heavily for Office work, browsing, video game & very bit of camera..  With all this if I start 100% at 7am by 7pm it is down to 25% or sometimes less.Having said that, every samsung lover is already prepared for battery life compromise.  It has super fast chargin, wireless charging to compensate.  With some of the battery issues of Samsung Note...i guess they are intentionally keeping it low.The looks & build quality will simply amaze you.  beyond perfect i should say.

"
"

  1st couple of months everything was good.Now mobile network is not working good.Phone is heating up quite often.Night photos are almost close to worst.I have seen many of my friends using S10, and they are ok with it.So it looks like this phone is second grade product.I need to go to service center for see the issue.After paying more than 60k product like this is not acceptable.

"
"

  I pre ordered the device from Amazon and I was able to redeem the offer as well.Poor battery life and an average camera.Only display is great. The camera is poor.Samsung phones are overhyped maybe it's the Samsung fans. They are willing to like almost anything samsung throws in the market.Honest opinion1. Poor battery life. The exynos variant which was launched in India is far behind Snapdragon 855. So don't rely on the reviews of the youtubers who are not in India. This is an Indian unit. Performance 2 out of 5.2. Camera is nothing great or not bad. As compared to samsung mid range phones camera is the same then why bother paying 30-40k more. Competitors(excluding oneplus) have far better camera. Even iPhone xr camera is better than this one. The night mode on this device is a joke. For camera I'll say 3 out of 5.3. Call connectivity issues. Even samsung brag about their wifi 6 is nothing special. They are unable to implement it properly with their os.The phone takes much longer than its predecessors to even connect a call. Connectivity 3 out of 5.4. For Indian unit battery life is very poor. You will get a SOT of 3-3.5 hours. That's very low.5. Now even samsung is launching M30 so samsung s10 got nothing then its mid range brothers doesn't have.OpinionI will not recommend it to anyone who is thinking to invest 60k in this phone and use it as a primary device. It's not worth it. I will recommend pixel 3a over this.

"
"

  Good phone with great quality photo and performance but fingerprint scanner needs improvement. Also the battery eats up big time, doesn't last 1 full day also. Things like SPO2 sensor from previous phone are missing in this. The proximity sensors are also not great. Found the stay awake option not work in most cases. While it's a good phone, this is far from greatness. Proprietary tools should be optional and uninstallble like Bixby. Also Google's trust to ensure all the activity gets on for using assistant should be managed. Its ment to risk our privacy.

"

  I have been using One plus 5T for 3 years and have been pretty happy with the phone.  Though there was no real reason for me to change, few things were prompting me.1. No more updates to OnePlus5T. Android 10 is last update2. Camera is decent nothing great3. Post 3 years i have worry the phone may start acting up.For me headphone jack is very important and hence all the latest OnePlus ruled out. I wanted to try Samsung for a long time and among flagship on S10 has the jack.Got a decent deal at Amazon and booked s10. Had confusion on this or S10+ but did not like the big from factor so went ahead with s10.Thanks to Amazon for delivering within 2 days that to in Vizag. Using this for a week now. Here are the impressions.1. Very handy. OnePlus5T felt top heavy and was difficult for one hand use. S10 is awesome and never feels it will slip out.2. Camera is quite good. Much better than OnePlus5T.3. Battery life is average. Have to charge it by evening.  Take more time to charge than OnePlus5T  and discharges faster .4. Fingerprint sensor is a disaster.  OnePlus5T was awesome. This in screen scanner is useless5. Screen is awesome. Much better than OnePlus5T.I am not yet irritated by samsung bloatware and it hasn't interfered with my day to day work. I will keep this review updated after 1 month.

"
"

  Pros:Display is good.Camera is good.Speakers are decent and loud.Design is beautiful and very easy to hold due to the form factor.Cons:The SOC is rubbish. Exynos doesn't outperform anything. Please don't go by synthetic benchmarks only.Wifi and signal strength is weak.Gaming is utter rubbish in this device. Heats up, battery goes down pretty quick and the charger cannot provide sufficient wattage. Even when the chatger is plugged in, battery goes down during heavy gaming.GPS module is not very accurate in this device as well.Fingerprint sensor needs very thin screen protector. So no tempered glass for this thing. You'll have to stick with thin plastics.

"
"

  I did go through tons of reviews and many of them were negative, comparing S10 with OnePlus 7 Pro but in the end, the Samsung Galaxy S10 did what I wanted it to do.ProsExceptional displaySlim and sleek designStylish punch holeHeadphone JackConsThe fingerprint reader sometimes may not recognize instantly (I don't mind it actually)Go for it...* If you don't game too much and want a premium flagship phone with one of the best smartphone displays, excellent camera, decent battery life and overall unique experience unlike a Pixel or OnePlus. I am whole heartedly happy with my purchase and all the updates have just made the S10 the best in its class. Really nothing to complain about!

"
"

  The phone is premium, so are the accessories which you have buy separately.  The screen is awesome.The only issue is Battery, which is moderate. It doesn't stay for so long. But, the better part is the Fast Charging which does it from Zero to 50% in no time.So, it's kind of like, a smoke break!! Every 8 hours!!

"
"

  I recently brought this mobile and exchanged Vivo V9. Camera quality is too good with given professional setups. 3400 mah battery is good with 10-11 hours of continuous use. Graphics are catchy. Worth buying it.

"
"

  I have been using Samsung lineup from many year but When i have received S10 within two days the bottom speaker and microphone stopped working, Thanks to Amazon i got Replacement for the Same 👍 and received a new one.Currently dont have any previous speaker issue but still phone is restarting own its own many times. Hope its a software issue not hardware and Samsung resolve it fast

"
"

  Beast in mobile industry all topnotch spec. nothing bad to say, you will get all best in terms of Hardware,software and performance.Camera is best of best you will get great output.Only one thing is finger print scanner which is slow as compared with other phones  ut since this is ultra fingerprint scanner which is more secure so ok  and can be manageable.Also i got this product for low price which is another great thing for me, overall i m happy with my decision.

"
"

  Most beautiful screen experience you will get. Power sharing is innovative and helpfulBattery life good and charges fastOnly concern is on screen finger print which gets activated in two to three attempts, also face recognition slightly lower in quality than iPhone XBut the good points are far more than discarding it for few small glitches.Camera quality, depth of photos and Dolby atmos sound quality are amazing

"
"

  Am using galaxy s series since s2 and this phone is simply superb like all others . Fingerprint is a bit slow or sometimes unresponsive so i have enabled face recognition which is very fast . Now i have enabled face , fingerprint , pattern all at once which is cool . The company fitted screen protector is a good thing . Lag issues on Samsung phones is gone with one ui  .The phone is an all rounder in all areas , just go for it

"
"

  Undoubtedly this is work of masterpiece...truly one of a kind display and user experience...got everything up its sleeves...some might say this phone got cons but truly there aren't any...this  isnt some cheap china made phone...it feels premium and is premium...not for people who complaint all the time

"
"

  Awesome,  purchase without rethinking. Best choice

"
"

  For non gamers like me n loyal Samsung user since from last 5 years,s10 is too far enough for my kind..I agree it does heats up bcoz of exynos processor..still ok..after all flagship features r there..

"
"

  Pro- camera, display, ease of use, features which none of the existing Samsung hasCon- battery life, wide angle lense with ppl in the background, selfie cam (really crap)

"
"

  There is clear difference between SD and Exynos processor,performance,battery life,heat management.....No doubt its a great device but if you get a choice to get S10 with SD 855 go for that only....

"
"

  Fingure print sesor is little slow. Camera is on little warmer side, low light images may look a little more on red, Battery backup is just fine. Can pass your day with a single charge for a moderate user.

"
"

  Superb phone , but poor battery life ....fast charging is actually slow

"
"

  A very capable device. Bought this for my wife. Camera and screen are far better than my iPhone xr

"
"

  Really impressed with  the screen  quality. The one ui is also smooth. No lag what so ever. If looking at flagship this wall be definitely at the top.

"
"

  Very nice feature

"
"

  Delivery was fast and smooth. Phone is great. Didn't thought will be able to move from iPhone. It's a great device.

"
"

  Samsung at its best.... Just need little bit fair pricing....

"
"

  Finger print sensor is pathetic. While camera is good, display is awesome. Battery lasts for 13-14 hrs.

  Best decision  to change from oneplus 6t to s10

"
"

  1 month usage. Best phone I have ever bought in my life.

"
"

  I am using S10 , 6 GB RAM and 128 GB Storage  for the past 8 months . Mobile is elegant and Beautiful. Slim , easy to use, looks Premium in hand. But it's having connectivity issues. Signal strength is always -2 / -3 bars . Lots of disconnections. There is a Lag in Finger sensors (Face & Finger print) battery will come for a day. Charges fast, no issues. Hangs now and then though it has enough space .  I have not downloaded any games which occupy space.  Not worth for money . I am fed up with connectivity issues. SIMs work well in other phones .

"
"

  Hello People, I brought S10 from official samsung store and got 6k discount (not HDFC offer) Thank you Samsung store for that.. Well I've used this phone for a week and writing review...Battery Life is below average, I have to charge phone 2 times. Samsung says its ""Fast charging"" actually It is not fast charging. I was using OnePlus phone and I had DASH CHARGING FACILITY. You can never compare dash charging with Samsung fast charging.. There is a big difference.....Samsung is lacking in FAST charging.. It is normal charging, It take 1 hour and 40 minute to get full charge.... while Oneplus phone takes 1 hour OR 1 hour 10 minute to get full charnge ...Samsung really need improvement on this matter. Rest features are impressive. Screen quality and android pie is awesome. Camera is superbOverall go for this phone if you don't care about battery drain

"
"

  Designed with sleek looks and a great weight distribution. Really amazed with screen quality, colour reproduction, the lowest and maximum brightness. Camera clicks crisp shots in bright daylight and brighter shots in darker night time. Also, wide angle camera click adds perspective to your photography. Other camera features like e.g. Super Slo-Mo, Live focus effects, Wide Panorama shots etc. works perfect.Anyways, speakers are not so loud. But, 70-80% is the ideal volume level for good effect. Fingerprint sensor works ok-ok, not quite fast but good for everyday life. Almost all accessories are provided, Samsung is not following the trend. It has headphone jack. Also, all other sensors like proximity, gyro etc. are working flawlessly.Just purchased this in Rs.58,500 by availing 10% cashback offer at https://amzn.to/30OX0M6 for my brother who is Android Smartphone freak. And he is loving it so far.Few perks like Wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, Samsung pay are given and are really cool.Below are some of the PROS and CONS just wanted to share with you before you buy this item:PROS:1. Fabulous display and white back makes it beautiful phone.2. Obviously, it comes up with the latest and greatest software.3. Amazing display quality and the curved edged display.4. Smooth Android experience with an Oxygen OS version.5. Excellent macro, depth-effect, bla bla modes in the camera.6. All back cameras are excellent.7. Ultrasonic fingerprint needs some getting used-to, but kind of like it.CONS:1. Feels heavy at times.2. Battery charging is not quite fast.3. Placement of lock or power button is out of reach for average-size-hand people.4. Selfie camera at night doesn't work well.5. Sometimes, phone got heat-up when watching videos or while playing games.

  This is one of the best phones you can buy. Period. A great value for 2020. I have been using this phone since June 2019 and this phone performs like a beast. It hasn't showed any lag whatsoever. Samsung also offers very frequent updates and so it also has got a few features of the Note 10+ and S20 series... It is a phone that I can easily recommend to anyone. It's camera is great! I prefer it over the iPhone 11 for still photos and it is still one of the best Android phones in terms of video quality, right after the new S20 series and iPhone 11 series. Battery life is also good but not mind blowing. It gives you around 4.5-5 hrs of screen on time on a single charge. I love this phone❤️.

  Excellent phone but battery life is disappointing not even 5 hours of screen on time if u you are heavy user don't go for this go for S10 + Samsung would not even let you upgrade it to the S10+after you purchased it

  Need QC processor  as Exynos isn't so good compared to QC 845. Outside India even S10 has QC chipset then why push Exynos in India.

  I own a galaxy s8. The phone is gorgeous, feels great in hand and fast too. Everything was fine until one year. After 14 months the screen started flickering and turned out to be a hardware issue. The screen needs to be replaced and which will cost around 16,000 inr. The biggest surprise was it's a known issue of samsung's AMOLED technology and yet samsung is not bothered and it keeps selling phones having the same technology used. This issue is so common that even there are android apps like 'oled saver' which almost resolves the issue by using software rendering, though it is not a permanent fix. samsung needs to ensure durability of it's hardwares as the s-series users would not be happy if they experience something like this.

  Genuine review....handy light weight phone battery not that good display is aewsome better than iphone which is around 80k to 1 lac face recognition might give trouble as it may accidentally get unlocked by any face power sharing is a good feature phone processor is fast it quickly opens any app camera quality will make u merry go round over all good phone but a little pricey

  The only thing that keeps me away from buying samsung high end mobiles is that they offer their homemade exynos processors for Indian market whereas they provide Qualcomm processors for markets other than India. They sell these phones at cheaper prices in other countries than in India. Other countries have some strict rules that keep samsung from using exynos Processors whereas we allow, we buy these phones with exynos processors.. So guys wake up.. Think twice before you buy high end samsung mobile.

  poor battery performance, Samsung is cheating customers with their low quality products..my new phone motherboard failed just after the warranty period.. Samsung ASP is quoting 18000 for part replacement. Makes sense to invest in Iphone

  🔷️ I have been a regular customer of samsung flagship smartphones and with S10 , the beauty , glory finesse  takes another leap.Here are few things that makes S10 , a cutting edge tech piece and my preferred choice.▶️ Obvious – Flagship processors and LPDDR4 RAM:*****************************************************************Indian version comes fitted with a 8mm Exynos 9820 processor instead of the 7mm SD 855 sold in US but is no less beast for a stutter free gaming or graphic content playback.🔷️The 8GB LPDDR4 RAM and 128 / 512 GB internal storage further adds to the technical edge.▶️ Beautiful waterproof design with Convenient Size and form factor:**************************************************************************************First of all – As Premium as it looks , A decent 6.1 inch screen with slim profile that fits suitably into all hands and pockets.🔷️ Neither too small like S10 E to suffer upon rear wide angle camera or ultrasonic inbuilt fingerprint reader and neither too large like S10 plus.🔷️ Comes with an IP68 rating that is currently the best offered water protection in any mobile device.▶️ Super amazing Display :***********************************You need to see for yourself to really understand and appreciate how gorgeous this dynamic amoled screen is over previous super amoled screens with amazing 550 PPI density and excellent sun legibility at 1215 nits .🔷️Display is protected by latest gorilla glass 6 which is quite reassuring.🔊 Just one word – Super Stunning.▶️ Super Amazing camera :*********************************Forget about one plus , nothing comes close to S10’s camera with super- fast shutter speeds , Excellent clarity, Exceptionally low noise in low lights & ultra-wide angle views.🔷️ In fact ultra-wide angle is such a boon that I was able to capture whole Tajmahal at just 50 feet away.🔷️ Ultra-Slow motion at 960 fps @ 720 p is also worth mentioning.🔶️ Only iphone 11 can compete in comparison but lack of a very handy feature like ultra-wide angle view takes the overall crown away from it.▶️ Very  loud with stereo speakers :*******************************************With S10 , Samsung has come out of its stigma of insufficiently low audio volume which was there in previous flagships. Now the audio is quite loud & crisp with quality stereo as well.🔷️ 82 dB – voice and 85 dB – ringtone compared to 71/81 dB on Note 9.▶️ Type-C port but with 3.5 mm jack slot extra :**********************************************************Yes , you read it right – even though you have a type C port in this , still it has an extra 3.5 mm jack slot extra to fit in your existing premium headphones.🔷️ Type C headphones can also be used with this.☝️ Scope of Improvement not a cons :********************************************♦️ A Li-Po 3400 mAh – Not that the endurance is bad but it would just have been so perfect , had it come with a bigger battery like 5000 mAh or something as in some budget Samsung mobiles now.🔸️I mean -  advanced small size processors like 8mm Exynos 9820 is surely power efficient but why should battery be even a little concern in such a premium smartphone.🔸️It provides a decent 18 hours with regular work but I would have loved to boast around , if it lasted like 2 or 3 days.♦️ Inbuilt ultrasonic Finger print reader is a bit slow when compared to faster readers on other phones.☝️ Final verdict :*****************🤙Absolutely amazing as of 2019 with an amazingly loud stereo sound.♻️ Do click helpful below , if you find the revoew helpful.
