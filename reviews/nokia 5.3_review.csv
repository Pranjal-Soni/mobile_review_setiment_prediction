   Nokia 5.3 Cyan 4GB/64GBThings I like:* Big Display which is well lit* Light weight* Beautiful back gradient design with pattern* Pure android (Android One) with out of box Android 10 and August Security Update (after updating)* Camera is above average* 2 Major android upgrades (Android 11 & 12)* USB-C & Headphone jack* WHITE NOTIFICATION LED in POWER BUTTON ITSELF* No bloatwares except Google apps* Flip to disconnect call and pickup to silent call gesturesThings I didn't liked:* Camera performance in low light* Screen ratio (bit longer)* Display resolution (720p+ or HD+)* Device battery and processor (comparing to others in 14k price range)In the box:* Mobile Phone, charger (5V 2A), USB Type C cable, earphones with mic, sim ejector tool and documents.Conclusion:It is a relief and life saver amidst the No China campaign. Strictly speaking, you will be more than happy with the performance of this phone if you are average user (not a heavy mobile gamer).This phone is great for daily use and Nokia could have added few extra features. Overall this is a beautiful phone for this price range and one shouldn't expect too much.Go for it, you'll be happy.Note: Charger is ""Made in China""

  Some people think that this phone maybe overpriced. But I have to say it is one of the best phone of this price. I buy this phone for moderate use, not for gaming. The camera of this phone is really  & the audio quality & battary perfect & in-hand fill are great. Nokia is not like other chiniese brands who have a lote of privacy issue . It give you a stock Android with zero bloatware, that give you a good experience for use. Nokia give 3 years security update & 2 years android update.

  Really love the design and build quality of Nokia products.Nokia 5.3 is a beautiful Android one device, hence zero bloatware. Great Camera, Big screen, Smooth performance, Solid build quality. What more can one ask for.

  Since most of you would already know about the kinda average specs. Here are my impressions of using the phone:> Built feels good, the plastic back panel doesn't feel cheap at all and the buttons are very tactile. The notification light is placed on the power button, which is hard to notice. The back panel has a fine texture, but it doesn't feel or give any extra grip, but the curved edges help in holding the phone better.> Display resolution is not right for the price and screen size. It's 720p+ on a massive 6.5inch screen. There is no outright pixelation, but if you have seen 1080p screens before you would notice that the text and icons are not sharp enough. If you used a 720p phone before then this display would be okayish. Other than that the 20:9 ratio makes the display quite tall. Brightness is decent.> Stock Android experience: Probably the main selling point of Nokia would be the clean Android OS it offers. There are no additional apps installed in the phone, except for some basic Google apps. Even you can choose not to install some Google apps like Duo, Google News, Google Play Music etc during the setup.Some may not like this as most other brands pre-install some social media and utility apps like voice recorders.The phone is upto date with security patches till August 2020 on 5 Sept 2020, which is nice. The optimizations are good and regular apps like social media, browsing and video playback work fine. I don't game, so idea about that.There is 2 year software update guaranteed as a part of the Android One programme.> Battery life: It's excellent, phone is well optimized for battery life. In my two days of use with 4G data on always, the battery lasted very well. I got 2.5 to 3 hrs screen-on-time for every 25% of the battery on regular use. But no inclusion of fast-charging is quite disappointing.> Cameras: Haven't tested much, but GCam seems to work better as seen from some reviews. Will update this later.> Confused hardware: There is NFC (probably because the phone was for European markets) but no information on a Gyro sensor. Though there is a compass, which some say is not available.Other than that you get a clear case and headphones in the box, like most other Nokia phones.Overall, if you want to buy a stock android based phone or cannot wait for flash sales, then the Nokia 5.3 is good.

  After using for two days , I say that a wonderful product designed and developed by nokia, little dissatisfied with the size of the phone, little bigger on size, I've been a fan of nokia since windows Phone, already using 6.1, 6.1 plus and this one is the latest addition in arsenal, the greatest thing is software updates from android one and nokia living upto it's promise. Had no issues with any of nokia phones till date like heating, lag. Zero bloatware and a pure android experience which makes it a wonderful experience to enjoy the phone. Basically I am an iphone user earlier, but after using nokia 3 which is my very first phone after nokia launched in Android, since then I have shifted to nokia completely. A wonderful brand one can rely on.

  Mobile looks very nice,but performance is very bad.Battery drain 100 to 10% only in 4hour and using only of fb. Mobile got hand in every 1minute. Over heat if you using multiple aap at the same time. As per Specifications, the cost was little high. I am using all brands mobile, but 8k mobile also better then this.I was pleased return request but Amazon service is very poor they not responding. And courier service also not give the this product to door step. If you don't wast your money then go with other mobile.

  Bought this phone yesterday. Writing a review,Pros:1. Light weight for 6.5 inch screen size2. Excellent build quality3. Stock android one with all the latest and greatest features4. I bought the 6 GB variance, and you can feel the multitasking works smoothly5. Face unlock and finger print unlock works well6. Color scheme and HD+ display suffices the screen. I was using one plus 6T, find very less differenceCons:1. Fast charging unavailable, however charging is decent2. I added 64 GB SD card additionally and it uses it as a portable device onlyI think at this price point, this is the best available phone with future promised and most importantly its made in India and non-Chinese brand.

"
"

  I am using now from last 2-3 days. Average phone with  high price tagNokia still long way to catch up with market trend or other mobile in this price range.Simple phone no special features in term accessibility like taking screen shot, launching camera, torch, DND mode,  or navigation.Battery 4000Mah but does not last for more than a day with normal usage.i feel price should be around 10k for product and features.

"
"

  Nice product in this price range, have used it for 4 days only presently, but found the battery backup to be good, runs for around 1 and 1/2 days, depending on usage. Camera quality good. Light weight, audio is good. Shuffling between apps is smooth and easy. Though there is 64 GB internal memory, most of it will get occupied by the apps and their updates it seems. Will require SD card for expansion of memory in the long run. Gaming was not a priority, so can't comment on how it works when playing games. Otherwise definitely value for money, and of course, 'Nokia', name says it all.

"

  So finally our Nokia arrived to take on other Chinese products.  I’m so glad it came back.  I’m using this phone it just works.  Thank you Nokia

  Pros:1. Smooth Software Experience.2. Multi User support, on my Poco f1 I could not have two users. One user I use for personal and other for work.3. Good display.4. Excellent battery life.5. Excellent Software update support. It will receive Android 12 and 3 years of security updates.6. No bloatware.7. For light gaming and day to day video usage is butter smooth.8. No heating.9. Software is optimized very well and Qualcomm 665 provides butter smooth experience.10. Much better than any phone between 10k and 15k.Cons:Decen camera.

  Fresh off using Samsung galaxy M30s, shifted to Nokia 5.3.Right off the bat, this one is bit expensive if you compare with Samsung products, way expensive if you go for other Chinese brands for the specs it's packing.That being said it didn't fail me so far, very good slick design (M30s felt bulky and heavy), good performance (I don't play games so I'm good),  pure stock Android with 2 yr updates so that's a win( I hate it when my phone asks me to install or installs apps that I don't want)4000mah battery does last for atleast 1.5 days on normal use. I was watching YouTube for 2 hrs that discharged battery about 20% So I guess full charge will give you about 10hrs playback. No fast charging could be issue for some. There was a bit heating issue while charging, not exactly buring sensation though.Cameras I don't use much so won't comment on that.One thing did bug me though, it's display. I usually keep brightness at 0% even in dark mode. With M30s and Moto G4 (secondary phone) I don't face brightness issues. Here with 5.3 first time I have to increase brightness.Overall It's a good phone. I look for mid range professional looking phones for long term use. Nokia checks all the boxes.For others who go for photos, games or higher specs it may not be for you.

  An elegant phone. For people who don't mind spending a few extra bucks on time-tested, solid brands. Nokia might not have been on the popularity charts for quite some time, but I decided to go for this phone after reading the reviews, and because I'd been using the Xperia R1 Plus for the past two years and needed a change. I am delighted to have chosen the Nokia 5.3, to last me for the next 3 years at least! The display, camera and battery backup are all decent. The 6 GB of RAM helps the phone run super-smooth. What I found most impressive is that the swipe gesture from the bottom of the screen conveniently exits you from any app and takes you to the home screen, or displays your apps running in the background depending on your swipe motion. Also, swiping inwards from anywhere on the side edges takes you to the previous page, which in most phones can be done only using the back button at the bottom of the screen. Dark theme can be selected easily in the display settings and it makes the phone so much more easier to use for weary eyes.The Nokia 5.3's build quality and design is awesome and reminds you of back in the day when Nokia phones used to be everything. I didn't mind paying 3-4K extra for the same specifications that other second-rate phones available in the market in the range of 11K provide, because I know that the sturdiness and delight of using the Nokia will, in the long run, factor out any premium I've paid for acquiring the device. I would highly recommend the Nokia 5.3 to users who rely on their phones for 9-10 hours of work in a day, 2-3 hours of leisure and the rest to battery-power conservation!

  Camera is average (good in daylight, but poor performance in low light).Charging time is too long maybe due to 10 W charger and more over phone is getting heated up while charging.Notification light is not working on app notifications (except while charging) still after various setting changes.

  Was a Nokia fan during my education years. Then we saw the industry switch and then Nokia coming back with android OS.Wanted to give it a try for old time sake. Well the phone doesn't come close to any of the expectations. My foremost expectation was smooth operation of the phone while using basic operations like browsing internet, switching between tabs (I'm not into gaming or using high performance demanding apps on phone), but this phone has unexpected laga very frequently. And sometimes it freezes for no reason. One more pathetic issue is that when you dial a number a the screen goes black for some time. No matter what you do it won't be active. Just imagine the call processing happening in the background and you are helpless if it was mistakenly called or you want to switch on speaker phone and move to some other tab.I think this is the reason that they only have replacement option and not return. That too window is for 7 days. Seems like a thought through way around. You may have once sold this pathetic phone to me, but I would never ever buy a Nokia phone now. Probably this childhood love needed a heartbreak to come out of the fondness zone of Nokia.One more thing, I was ready to buy another phone by exchanging this within a week's time. But this model doesn't even show up on the exchange phone list. All the edge cases are also covered. Haha.Will probably use this for an year if I don't end up smashing it against the wall for it out of no where screen freezes. Awaiting Good Riddance.

  It's a simple and solid device. Android one is refreshing without the pre installed and nonsense apps.The device and camera works good. Maybe a little underwhelming, but does its job.Android's gesture control is also intuitive once you get the hang of it.Overall, a respectable non Chinese alternative at this price range.

"
"

  Better try from Nokia to give this Android model. I'm giving my review after 4days of usage. Phone quality is really good, camera is nice. Weight is very less.It will be good if they still concentrate on user interface side. Yes, it is collaboration of windows+Android. Gallery and themes are missing, Girls will really miss those items.

"
"

  I did not see the spec of main processor/ram/storage  etc.. All i wanted was a phone to use confidently for the next 3 years with regular software update.Confident of Nokia fulfilling its commitment.

"
"

  This mobile has no features whatsoever. You are living in ultra HD age and this mobile is still living in 720+. No sound output in earphone mode. Trusted Nokia but now I realised why Nokia has lost its market. No Joy of having this mobile.

"

  14k and HD+ display

"
"

  Phone is good.. overall but not a value for money.Battery life.Just a normal battery.. used just 2 days and it barely made 1 day.CameraIt is fine.. not the best.. but good for day to day life.ProcessorOkay processor.. not ideal for high graphic gamesNot many features.. just have basic features.It should have been a 13000 phone for 6 gb varient.Only best thing is the uodates android one.. and a non Chinese phone.And the seal of the phone was broken.

"
"

  Received yesterday, used continuous for 3 hrs no heating issue. Battery is decent. Charger is 10W but is decent, you have 4k battery and no need to charge again and again. Camera is decent too, if you are Pro photographer, wait for Pixel 4a. Snapdragon 665 is enough for this phone. Receive 3 security patches within12 hrs.  But it should have 1080 display being 6.5 inch screen.

"
"

  First of all I've been using this a really great phone for 3 days and these are my takes:pros:1.great build quality for a plastic phone2.pure android experience with august security update ready3.decent main camera and good processing.4.performance totally cool for day to day tasks(i dont play games on phone )5.bright screen.6.speaker is loud and decentcons:1.low resolution display(fine print fonts gets pixelated)2.screen is larger beyond comfortable size3.battery average (with 7hrs screen time leaves 30% left)4.telephoto and macro camera utter rubbish.5.side button placements are too high given the phone is larger uncomfortably large.It's a fairly great phone if you want to avoid Chinese manufacturers like me. For optimum camera experience download gcam mod.

  I was very excited to buy this phone since Nokia was my favourite brand once. But once I unboxed the phone, all my hopes were shattered. I am not coming to the specifications at all, since there are many experts here who can give a better review of the same.I just want to highlight how user unfriendly the phone or rather the stock android is. I don't know whether it is a problem of Android one or the phone itself, but the fingerprint sensor is pathetic. It has taken 5 fingerprints of both my index fingers but the phone never opens with a single touch. After repeated 5-6 attempts, finally if it desires then it opens.You cannot silent/vibrate/put on sound mode from notification panel. Yes it is so.The autoroatate feature is disgusting. Most of the times the phone will rotate in opposite direction of my viewing angle when I turn this on.Wifi receiving capability of the phone is very poor.Since it is stock android, there are hardly any good customizations.I had to search the hell through to find a music player and then I found out YT Music the saviour. Seriously, the phone doesn't have an in-built music player.And one more thing, you will have to search in google how to bring the back button in this phone :-PFinally, the verdict. Please don't buy this mobile. I desperately want to get rid of this ASAP. For me as of now, Realme is the saviour. Nokia you betrayed me.

"
"

  Price is to high . In this price we get full hd display this mobile has hd display and processer is too old 665 battery only 4000...

"
"

  Don't. Buy this product. Behaves abnormal. Google assistant frequently opens up so irritating. Calling somebody and suddenly speakerphone will automatically starts. Hanging problems have to restart almost 3 to 4 times a day. Finger sensor is just horrible you have to press it hard to be able to unlock screen. Sad story overall regret that I bought this phone.

"
"

  I probably got a defective piece . the mobile suddenly stopped working after 10 days of use contacted amazon but got no proper solution from them, also I cannot replace the item now , because the window was open till 18 the of sept . my mobile suddenly stopped working, the screen went blank even though it had around 42%of charge left. It feels so bad that Nokia is not keeping up the quality it is known for. Now I have no other option but to visit the service center to get it checked, tried both hard and soft reset, but the phone is dead, I think I made a wrong decision by taking in account of the quality  Nokia brand is known for. I had been a Nokia user but sadly I think present Nokia is keeping up the quality, feeling sad that just 10 days of usage and brand new phone is dead , quality is compromised !! Now I can't get a exchange, no help from amazon nor from Nokia !!

"
"

  If you're into stock android without any bloatware or constant Ads running in your background then this phone is for you. Phone is fast and responsive for daily use and with good built.

"
"

  Just a Budget Phone, Average looks and average performance.For most of us one hand operation would be difficult with 6.65 inches screen!! Ladies and gentlemen it is not practical to use it with one hand!!!! This is the biggest drawback!!Average old style display!!! You get a really old feeling after using this.Nokia (HMD) you need to do better!!!  Bought this only due to current India Sentiment!!! Not worth the price!!!

"
"

  Not much complain about the price of the phone. The 13 MP primary camera is better than most of over hyped MP of other brand phones. Battery life is great when not treated extensively with high end games.The phone's clean UI experience and with 2 years of android update and 3 years of security update worth the price. Also with brand like NOKIA you get the best build quality and looks.

  I bought the device variant (6GB RAM, 64 GB Storage). As an Android Developer. I was interested in its Stock Android and guaranteed updates for 2 years.Pros:-1. Fast working, sufficient RAM, and storage space.2. Stock Android and guaranteed Android OS updates for 2 years. (good for developers only)3. NFC, Dual-Band Wifi, Good network connectivity, and good calling experience.4. Sepatare slots for SIM1, SIM2 and SD-Card. Also supports OTG with Type-C connector.5. Good Camera quality with 4k resolution, portrait and slow-motion supported (but not very good).6. Classic look with transparent back cover with Gorilla glass screen.7. No bloatwares or unwanted pre-installed apps.8. Very loud sound quality and Notification LED on power button.Cons:-1. Poor display resolution to watch youtube or camera taken pictures.2. Many required sensors absent. Gyroscopic-sensor missing which is mainly used in Google Maps for directions and precision.3. Lot of issues in software (like the screen goes off while calling many times and we are not able to cut the call).4. Very-Poor User-Experience in terms of look and graphics.5. Non-Fast charger inside the box (takes time to charge) and sometimes it heats up too even on normal charging.6. Battery of 4000mAH but lasts for less than 24 Hrs which is very less than expected.7. Over-priced. You can get the same device configurations in Rs.10K android phones too.Who should buy this device:-1. Developers who don't want to spend a lot of money on good stock android devices.2. Good for parents who want basic features with WhatsApp, FB, etc.Overall:- Good & Fast device but not for those who expect a good user experience from the device. Nokia lovers will also hate this device. Would recommend considering other devices too.

  Don't expect much but yes, at this price phone is quite cool and looks beautiful with this new design. Performance is also upto the mark. Thumbs up from my side.

  My Previous Review was rejected. So, I am writing again straightforward :-PROS -1) Android One - This is the reason I bought this phone. It has lot of cons which I knew but still I bought it. Its cleaner and faster and in 15k budget, I will say its great.2) Build Quality - As expected from Nokia, It has good build quality and doesn't look cheap at all.CONS -1) Display - Just ok. I can see big pixels easily. Just tilt phone a bit and you will see.2) Fingerprint - Slow and not accurate. It fails 3 times out of 10 at least for me. But its ok for the price. When we spent 15k on a budget device, we deserve this.3) Touch - May be with me. But I find touch not that responsive. Many times I have to swipe again to see notifications or app drawer. It was never the case with old phone4) Camera - Its good at day and horrible at night/low light but for 15k, I think its ok. That's my first low budget phoneEdit: 7th OctoberAfter using it for almost 3 weeks now.Fingerprint again: It fail 5 times out of 10 for me. I was using xperia XA1 plus before. There It hardly failed. May be 1 time out of 10. But In this nokia, situation is so bad that I am thinking to turn it off. I have removed fingerprint from whatsapp already.Connectivity: Many times wifi doesn't work. Other phones working fine. If I am using wifi while in call and then close it to switch to 4g, sometime it doesn't work. Jio and Airtel don't have connection speed in this phone. It was not an issue with Xperia XA1 plus. Sony phones are known to have bad connectivity but this Nokia did really poor. May be something wrong with phone? I will review for some more days and then make it 1 star if same issue persist.

  The front camera is really bad on this phone. And Amazon denied the return for this product as they'd return only if the product is defected, damaged or different item received . Completely dissatisfied by Amazon's refund policy.Probably use other platforms to buy products going forward.Thanks

  after 3 weeks of usagePros1)Nokia(2 yr software update, 3 yr security update)2)Decent Snapdragon processor (665)3)Battery backup is good(for average use, small games and stream)4)Display looks good(HD+). my previous mob has HD resolution so I didn't feel bad.5)Front camera is superb, the rear camera is okay.Cons:1)mobile is heating while charging.2)Price is somewhat high compared to other brands.3)audio quality is bad and feel the speaker vibration when the volume is more than 50%.

  Not at all good .. I don't like this device value for money...if it is under 10k then it would be value for money. Don't buy this... Its charger als not fast charger .

"
"

  I'm using this phone for the last 2 days. Battery is amazing it gives me almost 2 days backup. In daylight the camera is good, nice colour correction. But in night mode it is below average.I'm a mood gamer. For me snapdragon 665 is ok. But we can get more in this price.Best thing in this phone is stock android. No bloatware. Only google apps, if you want you can uninstall them.My verdict isIf you want to buy this phone for normal use then it is best choice. But if you want to use it for gaming purpose then it is not perfect for you.

  Would prefer phones to have removable battery and old fashion sim trays but this isn't how phones are made now I guess. It's better to buy this one than some chinki phone. Having a chinese phone used to make people a laughing stock and now their phones are like some weird status symbol. Anyway don't know what all those tech youtubers or as I like to say youtube home shopping channels are complaining about this phone. It is pretty solid. Go for it if this is your price range

  The phone out of the box has issues with speaker and microphone. When the issue was raised with amazon.in, they arranged a technician's visit outside the return window and he wasn't able to resolve the issue. We continue to work with Amazon Customer Service to exchange my Nokia 5.3 for a working phone.

  Firstly, I would say that my trust on Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. is reduced now than ever, as the phone's box was damaged, the corners were tore & the seller had applied a regular transparent sticky tape on it, and even the main phone seal was removed, so, the phone was definitely removed from the box earlier, before it was sold to us. Maybe it was a replacement unit, which was returned by someone & the seller just applied some sticky tape & sent it to us. Shame on you, Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.I immediately opened the box to see if the phone was damaged or scratched or something, & thankfully, it was not & is in good condition, so, I decided not to return it.Talking about the phone, the Nokia 5.3 comes with Android One program, with the Google's stock Android experience, which is the main reason I chose this over the other phones at the price range.Also the guaranteed 2 years Android updates & security patches every month, is what I like about this phone.The phone looks good, the back is glossy polycarbonate which looks just like glass & the Cyan color looks awesome.As it has stock Android, the performance is also great, the navigation is smooth & without any lag.The display even though it's not full HD, is clear, crisp & bright and the lesser pixels will help to improve the battery life, than it would have if it had a full HD display, so, the display is great.Battery is 4000 mAh, and stock Android's battery optimization & the Adaptive battery feature will help the overall battery life, so, that's good.The phone already got the latest monthly security patch after starting, so, it's a peace of mind to know that the updates are regular & will also get the major Android updates for the next 2 years.The main camera is decent & captures nice photos in bright light and the low-light performance is also okay. The photos from wide-angle camera looks soft & less detailed and the macro camera is just bad & I wouldn't have mind if it was not even there. But I'm glad the main camera's sensor is good enough to take photos & it's the main camera only which we use often.The Nokia 5.3 is a good budget Android One phone, at the price range (from not any Chinese brand) and I'm pretty satisfied with the overall experience of the phone.

  Nokia 5.3 is fantastic smartphone ever. Great Features. Feel premium & cool. Looking Good. Awesome build quality. Nokia give you one Quality back cover & Headphone with phones , feel great. Most people says they have only 10 watt charger. So I would like to tell you , It's a fast charger than other 15 watt charger. 100% satisfied with this Best Smartphone. Thanks Amazone & Nokia.

  The most trusted brand. Don't have to worry about security n the Cyan color is awesome n it's the best built phone in the sub 20k segment

  Issue production it's 10days only n phone display is all pink n it's becoming blank slowly n slowly why ?sale defective item🤬please look into this matter other's have complaint the same i want my money back now!!can't fool innocent people like me

"
"

  Got this phone on 2nd September 2020. Phone worked for only 10 days. Display turned bright pink and then went blank. I am now left with an unusable dead phone. Very disappointed with Nokia.

"
"

  This phone is for those who like a no nonsense device. The display, camera, battery are all reasonably good. The build is solid, and phone is compact to hold.I have been using Motorola for past 5 years. This phone feels like a step up. Comparison with cheaper Chinese brands are not fair, the experience with them is awful.

  First of all i am not a hard core gamer, but i am a moderate gamer.Battery life:if moderately used upto 12 hrs of screen-on time, complete gaming then 4 to 5 hrscamera: decent one for the main one 13 MP(Pure colors), wide angle color saturation is not upto 13MP, 2MP  macro noise is there and depth shots are good.processing: No lag faced when using, smooth performance, i have received 3 security patches updates within 25  days. when playing games too. Performance wise good though it is older processor, but it has android  one.charging: It takes around 2 hrs to get full charge.speaker: there is some noise in the speaker when volume kept low, but not noticeable if you do not put your ears  in the speaker.But very loud speaker, when kept volume high.the googles AI makes some task easier.the google assistant is very easy to use with dedicated button and very responsive when called inbetween games or video chatting.It had fallen two times from 4 feet  and not a small damge though(with nokia protective case provided with the phone)screen is nice,the brightness is actually bright, you will not notice if it is 720p when using,The compass works too.overall nice and sturdy phone, the OS is good as it's adaptivity is good.

"
"

  Using it for 4 days, speed is good in terms of ram, storage and processor as I'm not a gamer. Battery life showing good, in one day drains about 35-40%. Display is fair enough. Contains 4 cameras though I couldn't understand the use of the depth sensor one. A bit disappointing from the point of sound, without headphones somewhat okay but with headphones could have been much better. Used Nokia 5 before this, sound quality was superb. But overall good one.

"
"

  Great work by HMD globals...U have not compromised with the soul of Nokia brand....Everything is amazing...Camera quality is also very good but night mode not so goodHope I will receive regular security updates for 3 years for which I have given 14k...Overall good phone with great build quality...Come on HMD globals u can win the world...

"
"

  No Bloatware and regular security update & update in version having an edge

"

  Nokia has beaten all the other brands the colour feel performance gives you a premium feel.

  Nokia rises again! Honest review after 2 months of usage.Android One, great battery life, decent display, no screen lag, good audio, great multitasking, good design and colors, great hold and feel, decent camera (front and rear) - daylight shots are great, night mode, lowlight rendering are good enough, portrait mode selfies come out well. Expected at this price range. It's got plenty of neat features for business users like me.Cons: Nothing that's a deal killer, the headset could have been better, 5w charger - but then again i need to charge only at night after a whole day of being on zoom calls - battery still at 30-40 percent capacity. My previous phone would go down to 10 percent in less than 4 hours.If you are looking for value for money, Android One phone then this is a better option. It's Made in India too!

"

  I am owning different models from Nokia like 7 plus nokia 8.1 and 5.1 plus. I had the issue with charging port for nokia 8.1 which was out of warranty still got covered in warranty for this. The service which we would come to expect from Nokia from old days is still there.And for the Nokia 5.3, I bought this for my mother and to tell in short the phone is very reliable, this phone is for those who expect a reliable phone which will last you more and have covered all the necessary features, have top notch built quality. The phone is not for the gaming enthusiast.

"
"

  Firstly its stock Android and no bugs like other mobiles.. genuine security and software updates on monthly or timely basis.Then comes nokia build quality..for the price it could have been an aluminium block rather mix up..yet it's fine.. superb processor and Ram always choose high end variant..No lags on the screen and too good for murli tasking..yet it's bigger in size and careful while handling..4000mah Battery is lasting 2 days on a hectic days so normally it can last longer..Camera could have been more premium, if ur looking or purchasing only on the basis of camera don't go for this.. it's specifically not designed for camera experience I guess.

"
"

  Camera and screen quality is not good, Phone is too slow not like 4 GB RAM, battery life is average, No twin app feature, no app lock, no gallery app ( only google photos), Only design and looks good, build quality is good. But no features not worth for 13999.Also when i delivered the item package was very bad condition and one side seal is opened and found that mobile is taken out by bending box and pulling the plastic cover wrap on the mobile and returned back to box with out tampering the box. No smell of new device. Old unsold item. Very bad seller, do not purchase from this seller.

"
"

  Phone is Decent for professional use...exceeds expectations ...Much better than Chinese phonesCamera quality  =GoodBattery = Excellentcalling and reception = excellentRam management = excellentBuild = Decent0 bloatwareNo heating issueUsed with 44-50 apps ram management is DecentAnd phone is faster than samsung. Exynos  9611 devicesOnly disappointment is headset ...which is made in china....else Phone is quite Decent pick and  satisfactory to BrandGaming =Not triedLast but not least Sound quality and Equalizer work perfectly...sound quality is best.

"

  I got the phone withing 3 days. All safe and sound. Good packaging.Contents-Phone,10W charger,basic nokia headset,transparent backcoverMy first impression - the moment I took the phone out of the plastic case I was literally like 'WOW'.All my doubts went puff.Design-10/10Build quality- Do I even have to say it? 11/10I got a lot of questions from people around me like why did you go for nokia. You could have bought anything else. HONESTLY, I had to convince myself to go for this (With a tiny bit of effort from my bf).I had considered buying samsung's M21s M31s Or M51. Sure it had much better specs on paper But I was not so sure about its build quality. Now, I'm pretty sure my phone could stand wear and tear of my regular rough use much more than any other competition in the market with no compromise on the looks.Now let me tell you, I'll be getting 2 years of assured Android upgrade. Means I'll never be outdated in the OS section.It took 8 hours of movies songs and browsing to bring the battery from 100-0With normal usage it lasted 12-13 hours easily.Fingerprint scanner I found a bit glitchy.Face recognition is actually good. (3-4s delay)The powerbutton notification light is glamorous 😁Camera-8/10 I'm no wildlife photographer. I found its okay for regular use. Means if you are not into all the techie reviews you get on phone camera these days, its a decent camera.I found no lag switching btw apps. I opened multiple apps simultaneously had no issues whatsoever.Haven't tried gaming(not my purpose)Sound quality is good. Display is good.One more thing No Bloatwares.. I was so stocked for stock Android considering my prev phone was redmi. 😜To sum up I don't get all the negative review that this phone gets. I'm so in love with this phone.No regrets whatsoever.

"
"

  In first impression it's too good..!Yet used for 3 days only..!Please before using mobile update it fully..!It requires nearly 1.5GB update when you turn on phone..!And then all apps need update..!I didn't find any lag in phone..!Using for business purpose only not a single game..!I am using Excel, pdf, chrome for my website and my website apps and banking apps and it run smoothly..!Camera is good, I tried in normal lighting..! And it gives beautiful click..!One IMPORTANT thing, if you use banking apps in your phone it's better to go with stock android phones for security and safety purpose..!nokia 5.3 is with Android 10 and next month Android 11 is to get..!I am having 40-50 call per day and battery is good it give me approx 2 days backup..!

  Nokia has its brand and that’s the reason for this price. Quality of the product is sturdy and sure to run for years from now. Of course., this comes with Google’s native android OS which ensures better security and promising updates. But there are few cons for this price -1. Screen Quality is not so great, the HD contents even played have no great viewing experience.2. The sound goes sometime dead. You need to restart the mobile to get back to normal.3. Camera is not so great... Overall it is 13+5+2+2 => I know this range is very but I presumed the quality will match up to some extent with what an iPhone’s minimalistic configuration does., but that was a huge disappointment.4. Battery is just ok.., Not so great when the phone is used continuously for hours.Overall the price of this product can be at a range of ₹.10.5K for 4 GB and ₹.12K for 6 GB, that too this range only for the brand called NOKIA..!

"
"

  Very bad quality phone... Never ever buy... Always hang... Sick of it in 8 days... Want to return to Amazon

"
"

  Finally I got Nokia 5.3 ..an exceptional device at this price range. The display is vibrant in color & contrast, sharp text. In hand feeling is awesome. Call quality is also great .Camera fantastic. Device experience same as what Nokia advertised. Solid material and far better than Samsung and all other low cost high production Chinese  devices .

"
"

  Worst ever mobile that I have purchased. Nothing great about this mobile at this price tag. Samsung M21 is far better than this which is slightly lower in price. Poor antenna nor WiFi connectivity. Battery is big concern. Drains quickly. My old moto E3 power is far better than this in all aspects. Mobile hangs frequently though it's stock Android. I am using 6 GB variant and if this is hanging frequently don't know how 4 GB variant is working. Simply ignore this. Not at all worth for the price tag. One word for Nokia you need to improve a lot in terms of product quality and pricing.

"
"

  An absolute trash of a phone. Don't waste your money on it. I regret not buying a Samsung instead.The main problem for me is that the screen goes completely black while making a call and even when you answer an incoming call. Power or volume button doesn't help. The screen comes back on only when the call ends.I updated the phone's sytem too but it still didn't help.Apparently, this problem is common across most nokia phones. Should have known that earlier.Even apart from this, the phone is quite average. The camera is okay at this price range. Battery life is fine too. I'm not a fan of this pure android though. The screen problem is a major red flag. Other brands offer way better phones at a lesser price.

"
"

  Mobile is worth in this budget. Good look and attractive design.

"
"

  Awesome phone... And what more you need it's NOKIA.... Display would had been more better... Rest all good so far.... Will add more review after daily use...

"
"

  Good but mobile charger not good

  I purchased a brand new model Nokia 5.3 around 2 weeks ago & I started to face the Proximity Sensor problem a few days ago. I contacted the Online support, I contacted the Authorized Nokia Customer customer care & I got to know even they couldn't fix this. I heard it can only be repaired and not replaced. I mean who will be ready to get their brand new mobile phone opened and repaired right after 2 weeks of purchase and not replaced? I got to know that gives Replacement warranty only for 7/10 days from the date of purchase. So technically says they take responsibility on their products only for the 1st 7-10 days. Technically after that, it is not their headache. Nokia was a game-changer in the last decade and now its game is changing in the market against other competitors coz of this company policy. I would not appreciate this policy of the company of not replacing the mobile if it had the issue coming from the Company. I have used since the 3310 model till 5800 express music and I always loved to use this brand coz of its durability which is a big question in today's models. What an irony isn't it??  I would strongly not recommend to anyone to purchase mobile phones when we do not get a promising warranty from the company where we get the same replacement warranty from other mobile brands. I definitely need a Replacement for my purchase and not a repair from. This mobile was the First gift to my Father-In-Law & for sure made it more memorable or I would say ""Miserable"". I would really want to bring this into your notice. These little things will surely help the bring back their charm in India's market.

  A software experience non-chinese phone! If you want a phone only for the sake of software with zero bloatware and latest Android updates then go for it.Pros :1. Android one (zero trash apps)2. Build quality is good, only looks premium.3. Call quality is good, WiFi calling feature is added.4. Total control over any apps that you install.5. 2 years Android upgrades. (September 1 security patch out of the box)Cons :1. Weight distribution of this phone is not equal, can't text with one hand for more than 10minutes.2. Camera/Video quality sucks.3. Nokia claims to give 2-day battery life but it doesn't last even till evening.4. Phone lags sometimes during switching apps, specially during phone calls I found out.5. The charger is only 10W so it takes much time to go from 20% to 100% (i.e >2hours)Lastly the price should have been around 11k-12k.

"
"

  The Mobile speaker is having a problem, I can listen clearly while others are talking but they are not able to listen to what I am talking about. Call is also getting disconnecting very frequently.This is the really bad experience about this phone and i am still waiting for product to replace.No value for money, spent huge amount and not able to use the phone at all..

"
"

  I regret buying this stupid phone. Everybody told me to buy samsung but I gave nokia a chance. Camera is okay. Main reason we changed was that our samsung j was too slow. Nokia is not that fast phone. You cant even record the call without an alert for both parties. It doesnt even have a calculator or gallery. And the google assistant is too annoying. I wont recommend. For this features its heavily priced.

"
"

  The device is a delight to use as a daily driverThe only cons being the low resolution screen (which in no way is bad) and no fast charging. Else a perfect phone ...gwtting over 8 hrs SOT with power saving enabled . AMAZING!!!

"
"

  I have used it since last 4 days and I am writing about its performance as I experienced.1) It is simply the best comparing all popular china products within this range.2) Its battery backup is simply superb.3) Its screen resolution is okkay. But it can be improved as we deserve it from HMD global.4) Smooth operation with minimum uses of battery.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone by just looking at specs and thinking it's Nokia so quality would be good.This phone is below average with current market standards for camera, screen, performance. Build quality is very cheap. It's a big mistake to spend 15 k for this phone😓

"
"

  if there is less than one star I will give that toothe worest phone.trust me please don't buy this. I was crying after buying this mobile. getting that much irritating while using this mobile

"
"

  WISH I COULD GIVE A GREAT REVIEW. WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THE PHONE.UNFORTUNATELY THE PHONE TURNED OUT TO BE FAULTY. DESPITE 4 HOURS OF EXCELLENT INTERNET SPEED, THE SOFTWARE UPDATE DID NOT GET INSTALLED.THE AMAZON TECHNICAL TEAM WAS ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT. DIDN'T KNOW THAT IF THE PHONE IS FAULTY, INSTEAD OF GETTING REPLACEMENT/ RETURN/ REFUND, THE TECHNICAL TEAM WILL ACCESS AND THEN COME TO A CONCLUSION. NO ASSURANCE FROM THE TECHNICAL TEAM THAT IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTS BEFORE THE RETURN WINDOW, YOU WILL GET REPLACEMENT. RETURN IS DEEMED TO BE GIVEN BASED ON THE TECHNICIAN MOOD SWINGS. NO CONFIRMATION IF THE TECHNICIAN HAS IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF ANDROID DEVICES.FELT AS IF THEY WERE MAKING ME OUT TO BE A LIAR, BECAUSE I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FAULT.NO REGARD FOR OUR HARD EARNED MONEY. NO REGARD FOR BEING A PRIME MEMBER.PLEASE CONFIRM THE RETURN POLICY FOR ANY ELECTRONIC ITEMS BEFORE PURCHASING THEM ON AMAZON.EXTREMELY AND UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED.

"
"

  Awesome buy..got it last week. I'm impressed by the overall experience this phone offered. Love the Android One experience.. absolutely no spam apps..justbthe way I like. Camera can be better, but that's not something that was very important for me anyway. The processor is able to handle multiple apps and switching quickly between them. Good battery life, maybe need a slightly larger capacity bty. Loved the Google assistant button too. Bought the black one, seeing brown and cyan also available now...wasn't when I bought it.

"
"

  Hardly 15 days into using the phone and this happens to the screen. Pathetic. What a waste of money!

"
"

  This phone is good at1) Pure, bloatware-free Android. Two years of Android upgrades and three years of security updates is a bliss. You'll start to realize the value of software updates after a year.2) Build Quality. Feels Premium in Hand.3) Battery Life. Easy 2 days of time for 2-3 hours SOT per day.The display is not as bad as I thought it was. I've used a phone with an FHD display, and honestly, there is no noticeable difference between the HD+ Display and FHD Display.The Camera is OKish. Not as good as compared to 64MP Cameras that are available for the same price point. Stock Camera App works well compared to GCam on Rear Camera, and GCam works well compared to the Stock Camera App on the selfie camera. So using two apps for two cameras.If you want to buy a phone and forget about it for 3-4 years, this is the one. You get Software updates, so it is not outdated. Bcz after 2 years, you wouldn't care if it has 730g or 665, you would want android 12 with security updates.The Bottomline is, this phone is an excellent daily driver. Will never let you down.

"
"

  First impressions- Very good screen resolution. Nice video streaming and good audio. Calls, user interface is also very good. Impressive battery life!Like the feel of it. Happy to use trusted brand Nokia. Replaced OnePlus 6 + with this.Quiet pleased and thinking that whether there is any need for high end phones when one have good features at less than fifteen k!

"
"

  The device didn't support any sim. It came with corrupted IMEI. The replacement is also not instant. If you are gifting it to someone, the person will be in trouble. Sad to get such a poor service.

"
"

  Display is pretty good.Camera is ok.Battery lasts a day with moderate usage.Adv: two year+ android updateConsider Nokia before buying Xiaomi/Oppo/Realme/Poco etc.

"
"

  Phone lags, less battery power, low camera, slow charging, bad phone resolution , costlyBuy only if you need regular software updates

"
"

  Worst device. Just after 7 days I started having problem with calls. Every call connects after 10 seconds. When I connect ear phone, loudspeaker turns on which cannot be turned off. On payment apps unable to enter pin. Cannot even return the device as Return policy is only for week. Don't go for this device.

"
"

  5th October 2020 purchased Nokia 5.3 thinking that Nokia 5.3 will be a very good phone, but it is totally waste. I was using the fitness band and connected through the bluetooth through the phone. From the day one i am facing the issue on the connectivity. Once pair the device, it will get connected for some time and later it is not getting connected. Blurtooth connectivity is the major issue in this phone. I have contacted the nokia chat support and followed the instructions to resolve the issue and it is not resolved. It is frustrating.

"
"

  All of u note that in this phone we cant install dual clone apps.... major disappointment.In youtube found two optionsOpt1. multiple user/work profile option, but everytime we need to change user to see the clone appNot usefulOpt 2. Install a 3rd party app ( which has many ads and not reliable) to install and use clone/dual appNokia do something to support at lease whatsup clone app...

"
"

  I have used this phone for around 3 months the major issue is proximity sensor does not work which is irritating during calls as screen goes black during call and tap even does not make display on.Nokia failed again dont buy this brand they are not fixing major issues

"
"

  Handset is good, but Price is higher as compared to it's segment of others, Build quality is 👍, But there no options bar for Back button, in bottom as other's SO you Will confuse😵 how to back from app.  Over all Good, but not much users👥 friendly And easy to use.  Finger print sensor excellently work, hd+ screen ki jagh fhd+ hota to behtar hota par jaroorat nHi lagti, battery overall good. Side button blinking also at night.3 ⭐⭐⭐ out of 5star

"
"

  Pure android with good display ,build quality  camera and battery . Not sure if it's a good choice for resource intensive games but it's definitely a good one for moderate usage.Considering all these I don't think it's over priced.I am coming from samsung A50 ,it had some issues with on screen fingerprint sensor but in this fingerprint sensor is working seamlessly.

"
"

  everything is going good but 2 day battery life is myth.it runs for only 6 to 8 Hours after full charge.and ot has also problem of heating while charging.

"
"

  I was actually looking fr budgeted with trusted brand name attached. First name came to my thought was Nokia. But then I had dual thought to buy. Finally I bought Nokia 5.3. Trust me it's the best among in that range. Nokia s strength is battery n screen. This time again it has proved me right. Even the camera output also really worth. Overall in my view this is the best cellphone In an economic budget. You will surely proud on your decision to buy this phone. I could have written more but am busy enjoying the features of this phone.

"
"

  Pathetic service by Amazon. Since day one the phone was not working and the complain of the same was already been raised. Now unfortunately after a purchasing of phone in a few day my wife was having corona and because of the same reason my wife and myself were home quarantine for 14 days. Now after completing of period when the phone was given in Nokia care it was found that there's a issue of mother board so ideally the phone should get replaced but instead of replacement they are replacing a mother board and still the phone has not been given.

"
"

  I am experiencing touch issues where the touch is not very smooth and I recently discovered that it got serious issue while i try to use the phone while it is kept on bed or table. If the phone is on bed or table, the left top side of the screen touch doesn't work.Also,  I usually connect using home WIFI but recently I started to use the mobile data and it seems to be pathetic. I tried all sorts of mobile data related setting over the internet + the network reset option but still internet is intermittent and it feels very very irritating.Is there an option to replace this phone with another brand or refund? I don't see any option to replace or refund.

"
"

  As always best product from Nokia. Must go for it, don't even compare any other phone company with Nokia. Nokia  is legendary, Nokia is beast no matter at what price point Nokia is always best. Talking about camera it's 13megapixel is much more better than xiaomi, realme's 48megapixel.Even i am happy with its battery performance, gets full charge in about 2and half an hour and last about 2days in normal use and 1day in excessive use. If your looking for great all rounder budget phone with class ,don't think just go for it @nokia 5.3. Very happy with the product gives premium feel on hand.

"
"

  this phone is just comparable to a budget phone under 10k. Camera is poor and screen resolution is below average. User interface is also not as friendly as other android phones. overall not worth the money paid.

"
"

  Value of money, great product. This is my fourth nokia phone, first Nokia Asha, Nokia 8, Nokia 8.1 and now Nokia 5.3. Love Nokia phones. Awesome features and great quality. Nokia never compromise with quality. All features are working fine for nokia 5.3 as expected.

"
"

  3rd class product , Amazon replacement policy make fool electronic item don't by amazon

"
"

  1) Battery life is not good, 3 hours change 3 hours use only, then you want recharge your battery Life.2) Finger reader is not working very much, taking longer time, sometimes not reading.3) screen quality is okay but if it's comes with preappled screen guard that will be fine.Overall it's parformance is just okay.I'm very very big fan for NOKIA brand but it's not doing well, please consider this.

"
"

  Utterly disappointed with the display, 1080p video is not available when watching YouTube..Battery keeps draining rapidly unlike the othe custom UI devices though based on android one. I got another product after replacement and this time with additional problem, charging adopter is not working, is this kind of a joke?

"
"

  Bit over priced, quality of phone is premium with no lag, camera rear not good, front camera is waste, expected more from nokia. Great phone for one day usage, not for gamers,Not much multitasking, android one is fluid.Amazon service good, my first phone I replaced due to heating issue, replaced phone is not having charger in it. I blame retailer for sending faulty product.  But Amazon guys are nice nd supportive

"

  Positives:Super designLight weightBatteryGoogle assistantNegatives:Overheating when charging and when using multiple appsHight costCameraVery slow chargingAmazon tech support

  Worst Phone ever purchased.Speaker Sound is very poor. Call quality very poor.Face unlock is not working.Camera is getting hanged, and clicking very poor quality pictures.There is lag in screen response.When i am trying to return/ replace amazon customer care is adding ifs and buts.Where is the no questions asked policy now?Very Dissapointed from Amazon &Nokia.

  Overall a good phone using Android One and comes clean without bloatware.. I am using it for last 01 month.Updates are regular as Nokia promises.Although price could have been much competitive.02 issues which I found are fingerprint sensor poses problem sometimes and screen goes blank or black just after call is dropped from other end.Rest ok..

  Lovely phone and delivery came within a day.Very good phone for people who want stock android, good enough display and good processor.It does all the basics right and is a very sturdy phone.Very good non-chinese alternative and spec sheet DOESN'T always reflect the real life usage

"

  I used 6.1 plus from nokia which was quite good in terms of camera, built-in and performance.By trusting the Nokia brand i purchased Nokia 5.3 but i was very disappointed at very moment i use it.Camera quality is poor, front camera is even worse.Screen resolution is also not that good.Built in quality is also not that appealing.I would suggest that don't buy it for 15.5k.Don't know why nokia downgraded from 6.1 plus.

  Excellent value for money. Amazing built quality. Best hardware. Had all the sensors. Had amazing voice quality. Excellent battery life and a bright high res display. Does not have the best on paper specs. But has the promise of 2-3 years of software updates and zero bloatware. Phone usage experience is smooth and seamless. The fingerprint unlock could have been snappier, yet it's fairly accurate. Speaker is fairly loud too. I'd highly recommend it.

  Got 6gb model, 0% lag guaranteed. Best experience in daily usage.

  Who wants 1. Performance 2. Build quality 3. Battery life 4. Stock android can go for it.Average - 1.display 2.speaker 3. 3.5 audio out is good.Cons 1. Below average camera both front and back.It is sure that your phone will work perfectly more than three years bcz you get there years security update. So which Chinese company with this price segment will beat this quality ?????

"
"

  Pros: Low price, high battery life, good built quality at this segment, looks premium.Cons: multi tasking not good, face recognition issues a lot, higher latency rate, lagging is screen rotation, low sound on speaker

"
"

  Terrific Purchase, only downside is night mode camera  else everything rocks

"
"

  No basic application available in mobile like calculator, call recorder .. I expected camera quality like Nokia N8 but its upset me bcz moving items get blur. Battery backup is not much better than Samsung or MI mobile in this range. After 10 days of purchased its storage shows 99% used. I called to care than he suggested me pls reset factory or go to service center.. don't prefer it.

"
"

  met more than half the expectations being NOKIA product

"
"

  The phone is a real treasure for the price, the camera is perfect, sound is ok, the phone is fast and battery life is very good; last 2 days; the android 1 experience is much better than normal android, in short it's a good purchase!The original headphone is pretty bad but I used a Sennheiser on this phone , it sounded very good

"
"

  Trustworthy battery backup, decent display, good performance, value for money. It has single button for Google assistance and has a trendy notification indicator light.

"
"

  Pros: Stock android with no bloatware. Safe and secure software. Google assistant button is useful feature. Light weight and decent battery performance. Good match between processor and software.Cons: No FHD display, mediocre camera, small 10W charger, limited storage spaceFive star for software and 3 star for hardware. Average rating  4 star.

"
"

  I didn't exptected it to be so good , screen is big like really big , battery life is exceedingly abundant , it remains more than a day . Amd build quality is really good , it feels good to hold this phone in hand . Holding it tells us it's not made of cheap quality chinese products and best is 2 years of android update amd the phone is made in india

"
"

  Internet Performance is not fast as we could expect from its snapdragon and hardware.Speed of net is very slow which is a big negative point or we can say that This mobile does not get  good antenna or receptors .In our family we have iPhone,  Redmi and realme but This Nokia 5.3 has worst internet performance .This time Nokia has broken my trust .

"
"

  Screen hd view Night mode n camara quality good. Nokia lovers n pure android users will love it. After two weeks of usage. Just loved it.

"
"

  Pros:Apart from above specifications1. Camera is excellent (can give competition to other brands 64mp)2. Speed is good3. Light weight4. Good sound quality5. Good designCons:1. Front camera is lagging2. Finger sensor can be improved3. Battery draining fast if you are using front camera with flash option2.

"
"

  Nice phone. But Camera quality is not so good. And I am unable to get rid of the search bar on the home screen. It's irritating.

"
"

  Is it just a very simple phone,battery life is not as expected it's just last hardly 2-3 hours if used continuouslyCamera & photo quality: it's better not to take any photosPerformance: sometimes the touch get struckOverall their are pretty good phones in market then this at the same price

"
"

  Software is superb. Looks and feels premium. Though display is hd+ only but it feels decent. Battery back up is not extremely good but acceptable. The only area where the phone fails miserably is audio. Both speaker output and headphone jack output is very low even in full volume.

"
"

  This Nokia 5.3 is a great phone for normal uses. The phone is value for money. Comes with stock andriod. But there is a problem with the battery life of the phone. The phone need to be charged twice a day and its quit dissatisfying.

"
"

  Nokia means Reliable. You can definitely buy for the following reasons.Decent Battery lifeGood Camera for HD+Frequent OS updates

"
"

  Nokia is always Good. Nothing to say about Product. In Short AWASOME.Nice look, Nice Colour, Handy. Surprisingly I have got a Transparent Back Cover, and the Cover Quality is Very Good. If You buy that Cover seperately, You have to give minimum ₹599.

"
"

  Nokia still has long way to go wrt smart phones. Softwares are pathetic. Pictures taken do not save in first instance. Wanted to return the divide and go for Samsung, however there is no return policy for mobiles unless it is received in damaged condition. Software bugs are not considered as damaged. Cursing myself for choosing Nokia

"
"

  Iam giving this review after using 2weeks. The best part of nokia is camera quality and performance. Big phone, better quality, for middle class people it is more than enough,Pros:1 Good battery backup2 Camera quality3 Screen resolution is goodcons:1 Sensor is not working properly

"
"

  I love to use stock android phone due its simple and powerful features.This the best stock android phone available in non-Chinese brands.

"
"

  some charger issue this time they hv given a made in china charger so not happy with this charger but overall phone is ok nokia company plz solve thid charging point problem soon so that it will be hrlpgul to you and to us every nokia smart phone 6.1,6.1+,8.1,7.1,7.3 has charging pin problrm

"
"

  Not good.. I don't know what happened to legend NOKIA... Even if it's android 1,direct repository for gallery is not good which saving to Google photos, what it means for the internal storage of RAMCamera 😳, only charging is good

"
"

  The charging is not what it's say once you charge the mobile it takes only onther 5 to 8 hours to charge it's not the 1 charge that will last long for 2 days that's all false. Camera it's quite dull when u take pics.

"
"

  There are many phones better than this one in specs but I go with phone bcz oftwo reasons  android one software &  my love for nokia.😍😍😍

"
"

  Phone is nice, its taking too much time to focus while using the camera, battery life is excellent. It's mentioned in the phone specifications,it's take little time to full charge. Big display,nice graphics. Writting the review after one month used.Easy to use

"
"

  Price is much higher in respect of its quality and performance. Its price should be 8-9k. Rear camera is just below average. Battery exhausts within 10-12 hours. I don't play game. Data stays always on as I work from home.Face detector does not work properly. Earphone's quality is too poor.

"
"

  It's a very pathetic phone because of its hanging every time and also this is heating so much u just use this for only 10 Mintus. You feeling you are holding like a fire. So i suggest to everyone don't buy this phone. I want this phone to change. I have  doubt is this Nokia phone?????????

"
"

  Bad phone for heavy pricing , camera sucks all grains even in heavy direct sinlight ,2mp macro ( even a dash cam can take better pictures ) , I wasted my money

"
"

  Looking very nice. As for outlook it is definitely can pass the best level of 'value for money'. screen quality is also good, impressive and battery is stiil working in a very good way. However I am reviewing very early as I bought my phone just yesterday. So it is very early to say about its battery life and etc.

"
"

  Awesome phone in this segment. About 10 years ago, I purchased Nokia 7610. Now this one. In love with this brand.

"
"

  Very good mobile phone my daily tasks is complete with it and stock android is very fine.

"
"

  Nokia 5.3 has good battery backup and fingerprint reader has also good response . Over all it is nice phone who want to used for 2 or 3 years as normal used. Nokia has always good hardware components in its mobile phone . I always nokia mobile phone either smart phone or basic features phone .

"
"

  Performance is not good at all. Screen is getting off frequently while someone is calling. You can hear your own voice frequently and is not a neetwork issue at all. Very disappointed with NOKIA.

"
"

  This phone uses outdated Snapdragon processor when the current uses the 700 series processor.There is no fast charging.Over priced could get better models at this price.Completely unsatisfied :(

"
"

  So far it's very good. Battery is fantastic even though it's not more than 5000mah. Lasting for 2days with normal usage. Nokia Android one rocks..!!!!! Just go for it. Better than other mobiles with bloatware.

"
"

  Quality phone, pure android experience, no pre installed apps, built quality is awesome, nokia is doing fare job, quality and finishing is awesome, premium look , value for money.

"
"

  Good phone but overrated and overpriced since not much better display and also Screenshot feature is not so good..If a person used Samsung phone before it than he would be dissatisfied

"
"

  In simple words comparing with spec and sort with other brands you think you are buying is not worthy, when you actually check it it’s just better than what is said to be better than this,Also it is safe regarding patch ups and get android update guarantee ,that doesn’t come free.

"
"

  Totally impressed with the phone quality and it's quite bigger in size.. build quality is very good. Sound is also good. Camera is average. Overall very good.

"
"

  Alarm doesn't work, I believe issues with Android... Nokia need look. Rest all value for money... Good Phone that to make in India

"
"

  battery of the phone is getting heated with temp around 56deg C everytime i am charging the phone.i request for return or exchange , lets hope for the good return policy by Amazon.

"
"

  It's worth the money.

"
"

  Nokia is back with action.. its a good phone.. the cyan color is brilliant that catches eye whosoever see ot first... Display os little bit hazy as it is only 720p... Its an average user phone not for gaming... Camera is average

"
"

  Just Awesome. Sleek and premium design, smooth and clean UI, great Battery, Good Camera.It is just awesome. You will feel far better than stupid Chinese products. Will fall in love with the looks, design, and UI and user experience.

"
"

  Bought this phone a month ago! After a month the battery life is finished.. no replacement option. Even being on warranty period I'm being charged for battery problem. Worst product! No point of contact after purchasing! Useless ! Worst experience buying phones online.

"
"

  I ordered this product , look wise ok. it got  6GB RAM , but phone hang several time !! even 3GB ram phone works Better . I suggest Nokia, YOU have to work on your phones or will lose the market !! sorry but its true !! Even system update took more than a hour , what the hell !!

"
"

  Good Product but Upi page in digital payment apps does not fully scale up and we cannot use apps like Bhim, Phone Pe, Bank Apps etc. No response from Nokia to my tweet regarding this problem too. Kindly don't buy Nokia in future.

"
"

  I was a nokia fan and previously used nokia 8.1.and now bought this .the phone really sucks the screen lock opens simply by  pressing power button  though we have finger print and pattern lock enabled .during making or ending a call the phone lags and screen goes black.

"
"

  After many years Nokia has come with a great mid budget mobile.. great built quality,great display..good camera..I suggest to buy this mobile.. stock android..

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  Phone finishing is good.Good battery life.Pixel ratio, screen resolution not up to mark.Camera is bit average and not that worth comparing others brands with same price range.

"
"

  many necessary for life APPS missing. no call recording, not many camera features, Big screen hard to handle by one hand. FOLD both your hands in pranam form before buying it than later using both hands for handling it

"
"

  I thought I am buying a India made. But shocked to see the head phones are Chinese make. I don't know if the phone is also from Chinese.

"
"

  Worest phone ,touch not working properly,wifi to mobile net work if change mobile net not working,we need to switch off and on, speaker issue

"
"

  1st There is a crack on the device, and the device looks like an old phone. screen quality is also dull. hanging problem is too much its restart 4 - 5 times on its first day. Also camera quality is not so good. Chinese mobile has owned a better camera quality

"
"

  I didn't expect this type of quality form Nokia...wow super first 15days awesome after 2 weeks its  start hanging, flash light flinkering,automatic switch off, too much touch problems..why you processed worst case product for 15k budject? Chiiiiiiii>iiiii

"
"

  Very nice feel...not like chinese cheap trash. Clean stock android. No issues with playing games.

"
"

  See battery percentage after using two days Excelent battery thank you nokia brand super ultimate..Battery Camera screen all quality and i will sugest nokia company please release higher version like oneplus 8 pro with this battery life thanks to nokia

"
"

  Good phone for the value. Easy to use, screen size is good. I ordered this phone for my mom who is not very tech friendly and she was able to learn the gestures and keys easily. It also has a home look and usage option so that it is easier for people

"
"

  Over all ok . Speakers and mic problem. Little costly than other phones as per configuration. But it's not Chinese make it right.

"
"

  Purchased considering Nokia brand but disappointed. Finger print sensor is too slow to respond, camera quality just OK, screen resolution good. In short not worth the money as there are better options available.

"
"

  The worst phone ever. Nokia has become a very cheap company now. They are providing poor quality phones.Though amazon service is very good.

"
"

  Camera qulity is poor no additional features ,remaing battery and material quliyy is ok

"
"

  Lot of things needs to be fixed on this phone!, Finger print sensor is not that reliable. Screen quality is also low. There is little latency on face unlock. Yeah i agree nokia has taken a great initiative for come up with low budget phones.

"
"

  Good handset for Normal use. What I liked the most was Android One. No Bloatware. Should have provided FHD display and other important sensors.

"
"

  Although phone is good but it  would be better if price was little less. Average  camera and good battery backup. Great system performance and slight heating.Chinese charger and earphone.

"
"

  Screen quality is very bad. Colors are looking dull. Rest of the features including battery is good. But they could have added good quality screen or they should have provided display color calibration option. Nokia disappointed me.

"
"

  Not upto the mark. They should have provdied better camera quality at this price. There's no competition between MI VIVo poco with this. They provide much more quality and features at this price range

"
"

  Yes fingerprint reader and good battery and good camera.

"
"

  Once you love nokia then always you loves nokia!!built quality and look beats even samsung A51Stock android feel is vere level

"
"

  Everything is good but display is IPS LCD. For same money other companies are providing led or hd+ display , battery backup is ok, camera features should be improved otherwise everything is perfect.

"
"

   Within 1 month It's start Hanging. So disappointed with this. I want to return.

"
"

  Camare quality good( not bad). Very few regional Indian languages. No split screen & screen recorder. Fingerprint sensor very slowly sensed. No fast charging supported.

"
"

  Good one and light. Battery would have been higher capacity

"
"

  720x1600 pixel is too low is today's date, disappointed, Big Disappointed

"
"

  There is an issue with the product. The display automatically off and remains off while calling inspite of several touch but nothing works. Sensor doesn't work well.

"
"

  The phone is stuck on this screen since past 1 day.. switched off 4-5 times on its own and restarted.i want refund

"
"

  One of the best mobiles released by Nokia. The build and quality is far better than any other mobiles brands at this range. I love the pure Android version. The specs defined fits best for the price you pay.

"
"

  1. Display quality is bad.2. Both Camera Quality is not adequate.3. Battery is draining fast4. Started hanging on 1st day.It's not a value for money product.Bad product from Nokia

"
"

  Very poor battery backup only 5-6 hrs,camera quality zero,Look excellent,Light weight 👍🏻But not a value for money phone 👎

"
"

  Display resolution is not good enough

"
"

  Why this device is responding that much slow though it has 6 gb memory with just 64 gb internal memory where I've not even kept data in it.It's quite frustrating. All other things are found good.

"
"

  1. Screen vibrates while operation.2. Phone is slow. Hangs.3. Purchased 6 GB RAM, but cannot check on mobile that how much RAM is ?4. Add call option remain hide during incoming call.

"
"

  Worst phone by Nokia this time. Headphone and speaker both are working together. Camera quality is very poor. Battery backup is also not more than 5 hours.

"
"

  There is so much white noise while recording video and audio... Don't know if it is software issue or hardware issue

"
"

  A little bigger phone than I expected. Good build quality and works well.

"
"

  I exchanged this 5.3 once coz of screen getting dull automatically and I had to restart it to get it normal. I am facing the same issue with replaced item too. Poor display performance I have ever faced.

"
"

  It's overall a good phone. Not exactly value for money but it's passably good. Not built for heavy gaming. But a special thanks to @bhavana_s for her help in customer care service. Thank you.

"
"

  As the brand name is enough for many to buy. But everyone has one question in this price the other firms r giving a lot, ya maybe but u have see the security offer's and the durability of the product.

"
"

  Good product after a long time. No bloatware's and clean UI. Once if fell from 7ft and survived without a crack. Not lagging at any time.

"
"

  Not upto the mark. Battery is draining fast, camera is worst, it should have been fhd+ for this price

"
"

  Camera quality is too poor

"
"

  Phone box contained - handset, headphone , type c usb and charger, user guide , cover

"
"

  Great overall performance but the camera quality is not exactly as good as you'd expect. However, the device is worth the price, doesn't disappoint on any other front.

"
"

  Very worst battery and camera

"
"

  Overall very good, you will get stock android and great camera and 2+1 years android and security updates

"
"

  Very poor itme which i got...also major problem of heating during charging both mobile phone and charger, touch also not work properly at edges of mobile, camera quality is not good..

"
"

  My requirements are met.

"
"

  Appreciate the appearance and cost dislike button location

"
"

  It's excellent value for money

"
"

  Phone is good and very nice but the camera is not upto the mark has mentioned

"
"

  Im using this mobile since 1month... Software is not good,its not user friendly.. camera is worst..no in built gallery... Samsung is much better compared to Nokia

"
"

  Watching videos on this phone for a long time does not irritate the eyes

"
"

  Pros:Build qualityLook and FeelScreen resolutionAndroid OneCons:Photos in the night

"
"

  One sim is not workingIt's just 10 days and I am not able to return it

"
"

  Worst ever phone poor quality display and poor quality camera even worst than local phonesHonest review don't buy this phone total waste of money

"
"

  The phone has good battery life and camera.  Can work well with few heavy apps. Not tested for gaming. Overall a value for money.Cons. Plastic back

"
"

  As per the features it is costly... 11000 should be the correct price for this.

"
"

  Within 3 days of getting the phone it started creating issues. It got hanged multiple times which makes it worst Phone i have ever purchased.

"
"

  Overall good quality and good product....

"
"

  Worse phone ever .... Even chinese phone in 2010 use to have better camera than this 😡😡

"
"

  The product is not upto mark and I am not satisfied with this product .As such I want to return it so pl pick up this from my address and refund the money to my account pl .

"
"

  I received it with broken seal and replacement was refused from amazon/seller.As expected quality of HD+ display can be visibly differentiated compare to FHD display.

"
"

  Pros:Great UIGood battery lifeLight weightCons:Price is little bit HighCamera is not so good.Night mode is bad.

"
"

  This is a decent product. Some applications like direct storing into external pendrive are slightly complicated. Otherwise, for the money paid it is satisfactory.

"
"

  Good phone

"
"

  Never before

"
"

  Screen sensor is not working some time.. facing deficult while taping/typing screen.

"
"

  Nice product..

"
"

  This phone is really good in build quality, feels super sturdy in hand, and also the ease of android one is amazing!!!

"
"

  I have buy last 2days before, now i am facing phone hanging, battery life not betterI am giving avarage rating, not goodI feel Wastage of my money

"
"

  All are very good but camera is average But as per Chinese product it's very good with all facilities. I like the color and design patterns. Very new features are there.

"
"

  Brand name is enough

"
"

  The phone is frequently switching off and re-starting after some time.  While talking in a call, the screen is locking and returning to the screen is taking much time.

"
"

  Nokia at its best. Has premium look and solid build. Always a Nokia fan.  Not sure why Nokia don't market thier products properly even when making such nice products.

"
"

  Average mobile

"
"

  There is some problem in phone or phone networkIf someone calling you phone can't show in screen who is calling no ring no screening

"
"

  Software has some bugs. Okish price a little bit high for this.

"
"

  Worst and below poor quality juz like ,5k China phone

"
"

  Really Bad. No booster Charging. Screen idefective.  Automatic operation when kept in pocket.

"
"

  Don't buy. It's not even equal to samsung ₹9000 range mobile.

"
"

  Under rated mobile..perfect for daily usage build quality is very good far better than any Chinese brand.display is not as bright as samsung..

"
"

  Nice android mobile , in budget..

"
"

  Weight less phone

"
"

  good built quality and decent battery backup for nearly 2 days with normal use. It also came with good silicon back cover

"
"

  Performance,design branded are super.Pure android,cam was perfect.

"
"

  I genuinely won't recommend this product.It doesn't do basic work itself properly.Spending on buying this mobile is truly worthless.

"
"

  Don't buy this because 3 times i had returned it because box is unseal & headphones r chipper quality & made in china . Not worth to bye it from Amazon .

"
"

  Value for money product

"
"

  Phone fingerprint is too slow and takes 5-6 trail to work, or it locks the phone. I need refund. Do not buy at all. Or regret forever.

"
"

  Super Product overall, but I faced issue with battery backup while using online classes. Can i get customer support ?

"
"

  Everything looks good except camera.. Camera below the mark.

"
"

  Loaded with FEATURES...Camera quality is not good.LOOK wise its great.Handling is also easy.....Battery is Best in this budget..............

"
"

  I buy phone but it is too slow performance and I replaced new phone then new is too slow performance (I not installed new apps in phone only WhatsApp

"
"

  Dislike the product, finger print reader very poor quality.

"
"

  Feels more premium and dense than other phones of this segment

"
"

  The product manufacture seal was broken , returned the product but again received another seal broken product .

"
"

  It's not like I am using a 6 gb ram and Androids latest version it is too slow and I am not satisfied with this

"
"

  In this price range Nokia has done nice job.8/10

"
"

  The phone feels good in hand gives premium feel. The screen is quite big so that can be problem for someone otherwise UI and experience is good.

"
"

  Battery easily drain 1day  battery back is very poor

"
"

  Best budget phone.Great batter life, 2 days easily for just surfing and multimedia.Good display quality.

"
"

  Recently bought this and I have been using it for 2 two days, the battery life and charging rate  is too good. And nothing else to complain.

"
"

  This is one of the best android one phone under 15k. Do consider buying this if you want a ad free and bloateware free experience.🤩😍😍😍

"
"

  I am using nokia from long time. Much better then samsung high-end mobile.

"
"

  Overall nice phone with nokia premium quality.i am satisfied.

"
"

  Display Quality would have been better

"
"

  When opened Amazon pack phone pack seal was tempered.

"
"

  Software is good... Hardware could have been better in this segment compare to others phone in market.. speaker quality is really bad.

"
"

  Good build for rugged use

"
"

  Good phone with this budget range + at this price you get google one support and features.

"
"

  It does not pick the exact loaction in Google Maps. Camera quality is not so good compare to other phone in a same budget.

"
"

  This Smartphone is Great but it had few problems like battery backup and some camera grain other things are best.

"
"

  Nokia is back with a bang with this one. Amazing phone with all that you want and no bloat ware.

"
"

  Call  gets disconnected when the plugged earphone is touched !!!Very disappointing!!’

  Very well designed hardware. Very handy and performs without hiccups. Worth the purchase

"
"

  Good phone...though screan resolution should have been full hd not just hd....

"
"

  The phone looks great. The performance and camera is also good at price range.

"
"

  VERY GOOD CLARITY AND BATTARY BUT CAMARA IN VERY NORMAL

"

  Phone is good .Battery optimization is good ,but charging time is a major back draw .

"
"

  nokia is playing a very bad game..battery life is not adequate..

"
"

  Satisfied with the product. Value for money. With good built quality compared to chinese phones

"

  Waste of money

  One alternative to all the Chinese mobile handset and very good. Nokia back in action.

  Just design looks good.  Over priced and bad battery backup.

"
"

  Very impressive phone performance....

"
"

  Looks very sleek and handy. Great battery life and quality of screen unmatchable.

  Totally satisfied with the purchase. You won't notice the notch in the display as it is a large screen. Also 720p display actually helps you keep battery from dropping even if you watch hours of YouTube or movies. Speaker is okay. Nokia with Android One gives you smooth usage. Only issue I faced was in Chrome freezing. But that was solved after uodate from Play store. Also, using the Google Cam or Lightroom Camera we can totally exploit all the cameras on this phone. Selfie is good. Buttons are firm but tactile. You can turn off the Google assistant button. But i find it very useful. Processor handles all tasks with ease. 15+ apps stay on RAM. NO ISSUES.

"
"

  Bit costly, around 2K, when you just consider specifications and features. But if you think that, Nokia has to support for next 2 years with constant security updates and Android upgrades, it feels worth to pay that extra amount. It has been few weeks of use, with all ms-office and other necessary apps, no problems found, for every day usage and would still be left with around 30GB. Feels good quality while usage. Minimal security risk due to nearly stock android. Possibility of malware from other app-stores like mi-store or galaxy-store is also avoided. Gives an impression of  safe environment for any financial or professional use. I am not a gamer, so can't comment on it. No bloatware, so might last long with current performance. Bit difficult to find proper edge-to-edge screen protector online though. Probably a well balanced trade-off between specifications, security and build quality.

"
"

  This device is an absolute bang for the buck. The phone is super sturdy and has great built quality, simply amazing feel just to hold it in your hands. Doesn't feel like those cheap chinese devices. Screen is huge and battery life even bigger - makes it convenient to take office/work calls when on the move.

"
"

  The spare parts are too costly which you cannot pay incase of repair. I purchased 6.1 plus for 9000 in amazon. Display got crack. I went to service for repair... They told the cost of display is ₹10,500 which is costlier than the mobile itself. Don't never ever buy Nokia. This is not the old Nokia brand. HMB Global purchased the name NOKIA from original Nokia company. The after sales service is too worse you regret buying this phone when you go for a repair.

"
"

  Do the following steps after buying the phone....1. Install Microsoft Launcher.2. Install GCam ( photos with gcam has ability to beat any phone in this segment that is 13.1 MP camera captures image of 13 MB size.  And the details are awesome while stock camera with 3 sensors are useless)Rest is okayMy Ratings... on scale of 1 to 51. Screen - 22. Speaker - 43. Processor + ram + emmc - 44. Main Back camera - 4.55. Selfie camera - 26. Wide angle - 17. Macro - 18. Design + (type C + headphone jack) - 59. Call quality (mic + earpiece) - 510. Battery - 3.511. Charger - 3.512. Earphone - 113. Case - 514. Sim ejector pin - 515. Packing - 316. Software - 5+Rest is good.Remind the review as I am a business person i use my phone for business centric works.... Not for gaming , watching , social media. But For Banking apps, calling, web works on chrome, clicking a lot of photos and sending them, syncing device with multiple systems(like printer and scanner), a lot of data transfer and testing apps.Note - Banking apps run 2x faster than any mediatek device

"
"

  6 gb phone, if not showing 6gb as total memory when you start your phone for the first time, you will need to reboot the device and then you can see 6gb as total memory. Nice value for money phone with all basics done right including the price.

"
"

  The first thing which you will notice when you hold the phone in your hand is the build quality.. it's top notch. Feels very premium at this price range. Screen is large good for watching videos, screen is bright enough for outdoor use. Battery back up last for a day. Camera is very good in good daylight but struggles a bit in low light. Need to hold your pose and camera still for a couple of seconds for a good shot! Back gesture by swiping from left or right edge of the screen is cool. For those who are not comfortable with it can switch to normal mode through settings.One thing is for sure heads will turn once you take it out! A little bit pricey but good overall package. Highly recommended.

"
"

  Nokia is almost gone from market they tryed to come back but their all ardoid handset are big failure..so nokia want to improve their quality they should launch good product with good price ..13999 to buy nokia 5.3 is foolish thing or nothing

"
"

  Not upto the mark. Quality feels cheap like Chinese phones, like oppo, redmi etc.4gb+64gb should be for max to max 10000₹. Now a days 8gb+128gb phones of many good company are easily available for 20000₹.

"
"

  Sturdy , non chinese, very good looks and long battery life. Its a stock android phone means you are free from unnecessary space consuming and unreliable apps. Camera could have been a little better.

"
"

  Loving the design and feel of the Nokia 5.3 iny palm. Not too light, or too heavy, in fact just *right*. Feels like a premium phone despite the price. And boy does it make heads turn!Loving the camera as well. Low light may need some improvement, and I'm sure Nokia's promise of updates will take care of it.Stock android is one of the main reasons why I bought this phone. No more ads and no more doubts over whether my data is secure.

"
"

  Nokia Phones are the worst. After 6 months of using Nokia 8.1 my phone stopped charging and then I got to know that it's a manufacturing defect in Nokia that happens with everyone. If you search on YouTube you'll find so many videos regarding the same issue. Alot of people are facing this and there is no way you can fix this. Once you get it repaired after few months the same thing will happen again. I've already gotten it done twice.

"
"

  I suggest you to do not buy any Nokia android mobileI bought Nokia 8.1, just after six months front camera failed. I communicated with Nokia customer care but no use .My friend bought another Nokia . He got display problem.My father also bought Nokia. Sometimes suddenly mobile network goes off and by restarting we got network.I am a big fan of NokiaBut everything disappointed

"
"

   One of the most beautiful phones ever.Clean UI and no unnecessary apps.Camera quality is very genuine and battery backup is good.Overall performance is great without any lag.

"
"

  I m using Nokia 6.1 Pulse from last one yearVery worst experience with nokia1. Hang problem2. Battery power vry low4. Charging problem , this problem my almost nokia user frnd hv as phone doest not charge5. Charger and cable got faulty after 6 monthThink twich before going with nokia

"
"

  Every should know what's best in the interest of the nation. Right now it's to avoid any Chinese brand and Nokia provides us with an alternative, we should not nitpick with price because that's how the Chinese brands win.

"
"

  A very very bad decision to purchase this phone.Voice calls are weak to hear.. Everytime signal problem with every sim airtel, jio, voda. Even whatsapp call over wifi not working. 22nd day and still in the care center. Bad choice. Now we got why it fail as mobile industry.

"
"

  Seriously 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰. I have no words for this product.. Because i have never see this type of phone.... Battery is too very good. finger print reader is too good. Display quality is too excilent 🌹🌹🌹🌹Mixing everything, it is a great #Mobile🥰🥰

"
"

  Big display & good battery life. Tactile finish is nice and the phone feels solid. Multitasking gestures are intuitive. Overall, quite satisfied with the phone.

"
"

  The price of the phone is bit on the higher side for the specifications it's offering. The phone is good enough for daily use. Camera quality could have been better. Screen resolution, speakers are top notch.It's good to be back using a Nokia phone after a decade.

"
"

  Nothing ever beats a Nokia design, build quality and superb clean Android experience.My family has 7.2, and I have bought 5.3 for my brother.

"
"

  This time NOKIA is very disappointing , this phone only look wise is good, this mobile hang daily in 24 hours 1-2 times, me and my friend bought same day same phone, we both are facing same problem....Its request to all Please do not purchase NOKIA 5.3

"
"

  Finally a good Phone after a long Time.Thank You Nokia.Vedeshi bhagao Swadeshi Apnao.Camera OkayBattery GoodDisplay GoodScreen Size GoodWeight with provided Cover LightUpdate Don't know

"
"

  Display is hopeless. Build quality doesn't feel like Nokia.Plastic body and slippery.Runs latest clean android. That's the only good thing.

"
"

  Got this phone for my mother and she absolutely loves. Her job is made easier through google assistant. It is our family phone.

"
"

  Overall, an okay phone for its price and the purpose of getting the phone. No extensive gaming or photography done, so it met the necessary requirements.

"
"

  Please buy some redmi or Xiaomi phones or some other China phones.. This is utter waste of money. Fingerprint sensor is slow, phone behaves utter slow sometimes

"
"

  Great device. Best budget phone by far. So happy with the purchase. Would recommend this to all the users. Nokia 🥳

"
"

  big screen is main negativeAverage battery is another issueAverage cameraPrice too muchPrice should be max 10k to 11k

"
"

  Awesome phone & features,Reliable phone with neat experience. Zero bloatware.Awesome screen quality & fingerprint reader battery life also good.

"
"

  I loved the build quality and design and how sleek it was in my hand. The OS is smooth and the fingerprint sensor is a smooth experience. Huge screen and great 1.75 day battery for mw

"
"

  The product is really well built, European heritage is clearly visible. The price is also not too high.The battery life is super long... all in all, in this segment a super android phone

"
"

  My husband recently gifted me this phone. I am loving it. the battery lasts 2 days and the camera quality is also good.Highly recommended.

"
"

  Not good. My suggestion is go for xiaomi mi A3. Good phone with AMOLED screen and 48mp rear and front 32. Indisplay fingerprint go for mi a3

"
"

  Go for samsung instead ..You will regret buying this product as Nokia phones have worst motherboard ..it's nothing but just a cheap Chinese smartphone branded as Nokia

"
"

  Poor display quality, very poor processing system, worst front glass and back cover. Worst even than cheap Chinese phone. I fed up  this phone in three months.

"
"

  DO NOT BUY NOKIA SMARTPHONES. THEY STOP WORKING AFTER WARRANTY PERIOD. REPARING CHARGES ARE HALF THE COST OF MOBILE AT NOKIA CARE

"
"

  Nokia is always best and good quality as always, good as it looks and nice performance.good choice in mid range.

"
"

  Worst features in this price range.How could you guys can release this smartphone in this price.Wowwwwww Nokia. 👍

"
"

  Build quality is good, Battery life is good looks is good but camera is too Poor. Picture quality is not good.

"
"

  Phone is made IndiaBut charger is made in chinaBattery is ok but display is not so goodAndroid one software is having lots bug need to improve

"
"

  QR Code scanning is almost impossible with this device. the camera does not focus itself and hence seems to be a waste product.

"
"

  Value for Money .. supe r good built quality. Great camera , Fingerprint reader , battery is really great . I liked it.

"
"

  Great Product and Battery Life.Camera is by far the best camera I have used so far. Exchange offer is very good.

"
"

  Loved this product. Nokia returns with the ame quality. I trust this brand a lot. The entire experience is amazing.

"
"

  We are getting much more at this price pointCameraWhen i checked in the description there is not mentioned anything about cameraAnd nokia advertising quad cameraYou should mention everything in descriptionProcessorOld generation Processor in this phone we get Snapdragon 665 which is decentFor day to day use its enough.Display6.55 HD+ display even this is not Full HD displayAt this price point we must FHD display.BatteryWe get 4000 mAh Battery which is good for Norma use.Build qualityAmazing build quality no issue with design and build qualityThis is android OneMeans you will get OS update and security updates for next two years which is goodAndroid o e is bloatware free os OFFER by GoogleI recommend this phone because of Android OS.Price is little bit High but its is ok due to Android One OS

"
"

  I was looking for alternative for Chinese phones and here i got it.I would not say everything is good and very upto mark but Ok at this price range.Look is good and premium.Cyan color is good..battery,camera,function all are good for general use.I am giving review in 2nd day but will explore and share detailed info later...But yes..i am not taken oppo,vivo,mi,poco..Jai Hind...

"
"

  Front camera is not working after one month use

"
"

  I bought this device just considering Android one , initially I was not happy with specifications ,as it's not sounds good not full hd screen older processer just as 665 , I was using nokia 8.1 , moreover I had clear thaught I won't be buying any other then Android one  device. As promised by nokia the best thing is device is smooth ,when you are not tech guy it's won't matter what's inside just device need run smooth , it's good device good value for money  , battery part is awesome it's run 3 days still 30 % battery on moderate run , using fb and youtube calls and  browsing , I haven't yet tested gaming things. I recomended to buy 6 gb version , as I see ram uses it's above 2.5 gb yet . It's good device don't gets fooled by bloatware devices with higher specs but lower built quality,  camera is ok  , giving 4 star out if 5 as expectation is to get better processor and full hd screen , I recomend this device for regular uses , about gamers they need consider anything above sd 710.

"
"

  Volume through wired headset is terribly low - ordered this mobile after looking at lost of reviews. But it was never mentioned anywre that the volume was low on wired headsets. Although I was aware the video quality wasn't gonna be great didn't expect the same with audio as well. I mean u pay 14k and getting a bad video and audio quality isn't acceptable guys. Nokia u lost the trust, the brand value has seriously gone down. Absolutely poor or even worse!!

"
"

  Writing this review after one week of use of 6 GB RAM version:My motivation to buy this phone was1) Buy a ""Non-Chinese"" phone  For obvious reason : if not me, who? if not now, when?2) Bloatware free android experience  Nokia, Motorola and Asus (up to a level of my satisfaction) were the options. However Moto unfortunately have  turned chinese and Asus is out of touch currently3) Atleast 4000 mah batteryAnd I find Nokia 5.3 was a right choice.For me battery lasts for 2 days after full charging (watched one 2 hrs movie during charging cycle). It takes around 1.5 to 2 hour charging. It is okay with me. Infact I find it takes same charging time as my Samsung A51 (with 5000 mah battery) takes with fast charging.Watching movie was a good experience over a wide screen. Camera is good (I am not a selfi or camera fan).Only disappointment was the headphones quality. Sound quality is good, but looks cheap. (Unfortunately headphone and charger are China made. One star less for that).People are complaining about the price, but paying 2-3k more for a ""non-chinese"" brand is okay for me.

"
"

  Very much fast delivery within 12hr. Amazon.in and Appario retail Pvt Ltd(seller) fully satisfied customers. Therefore a strong bond connection have been made between Amazon and customers.I only purchased this phone for nokia and android one.This phone is for moderate use. Camera is good but not best and price should not be greater than ₹13000. In day light both rear and front camera works good but in low light/night light it struggle. This problem should be fixed with next update. And display is ok but full hd display should be more entertaining. Speaker doesn't loud enough and using headphones still not getting enough sound. I think this sound problem should be fixed with next update.And Android one os is fully awesome and optimize performance for good battery backup.

"
"

  Day 1: The sound isn't working properly.Played a youtube video. There was hardly any speaker output in spite of the Media volume being set to maximum. Only after I restarted the phone did the speaker start working.Therein started the main issue. Now, only the speaker is working. Neither the ear piece speaker nor the hands free is working. Pressing the speaker tab ON and OFF doesn't matter.Have asked Amazon support for a technician visit for checking the product. Let's see how that goes.Update: The technician confirmed that there is a problem with the phone. Ordered a replacement. The issue persists. Returned.

"
"

  I wanted a phone for a senior citizen, I was looking for plain Android without any crapware and this phone without the bill. It felt super thin and comfortable to hold. Audio was loud and clear which was important for the elderly I was getting the phone for.After Amazon delivered the phone, when I opened it, I noticed the seal was loose and there extensive fingerprints all over the plastic cover over the phone and on the phone display. Immediately I called Amazon, the rep was super helpful and after listening to my complaint, he arranged for a hand to hand replacement within 24 hours and said he will ensure the replacement will be perfect, which it was. I wish the checks had happened the first time itself, but we need to be cognizant that these things are bound to happen in any shop.Overall, I am liking the phone and I appreciate the attention to detail and customer caring by Amazon.

"
"

  I wanted a stock Android phone because I find bloatware annoying and, worse, it seems to be spyware on my Mi phone. This phone is clean, great performance even in gaming, battery life is more tban satisfactory, and it's a trusted name. I'm not interested in cameras, so I haven't tested it. Sound is good. The drawback is the display. It looks washed out, like a faded picture, which does impact viewing. At this price, most phones have a vibrant, sharp display.

"
"

  Nokia is back... I got it for daughter who is 10 years old & she is too happy to see that the phone is bigger than my iPhone 11 , Face ID etc.. hi google feature- she says it is better than I phone 6s she was using earlier before screen damage... Personally I had been a Nokia fan before Apple came - I loved hearing Nokia tune once again

"
"

  I got the device on 5'th of September and within two days I observed  the issues. The phone looses wifi easily even on the same room. The camera quality is so bad. Video quality over WhatsApp/Google Duo is so bad that it looks like the phone has VGA camera. The video stuck a lot over video calls and audio is also bad. It became unusable .Better to stay away form this device. I replaced the device and got the replacement on 12'th sept ,but getting the same issue. I wonder why no one has mentioned these issue on the reviews.

"
"

  Mobile is very user friendly, fast without any bloatware, excellent screen size comfortable to read eBooks and fits in pocket. Battery runs for 10 hours internet use as assured. 2days each of 5hours internet use. Sand colour is just awesome.Cons. Just a HD+ display. Full HD could be better.Wifi connectivity is problematic at times.

"
"

  Worst phone ever bought. No camera quality as I opened I tested the camera and the camera could not focus. Screentouching badly , poor network quality and etc. Really bad phone. This phone came 2 times as first when it came I replaced it and the second time returned it . Worst product ever. Cheap product. Its real price should be 3000 rs. Do not buy. After buying you will become too angry and irritated due to this product.

"
"

  Excellent cellphone with amazing features. I'm fully satisfied with all the accessories along with a beautiful cellphone protection cover, earphones USB cable and easy care and accessibility instructions. Large screen and smart features. It's really a smartphone. You will be proud of it. Nokia is Nokia.

"
"

  This is not a china brand, price might be a little high around 2k with the given features when compared to china phones. But during the sale it is priced at 13k - 10% discount, so I feel I got this at a good price (under 12k). This is nokia, the build quality is good, so we can put that 2k.

"
"

  This phone is great, good performance and smooth operation and with Nokia reliability.With only required Apps and clean OS the phone is fast. Display is good enough for photos and as well as for Games.Back to Nikia

"
"

  I had issue of testing blood sugar instrument of Neato when I had Nokia 3.1. Exchanged it to Nokia 5.3. but problem remains same. I think Nokia's do esign issue. The same Neato works fine with Panasonic, Moto, linova etc.....

"
"

  A phone's primary function is calling, while the phone has godd camera and battery life, it's voice quality is not the best. The call volume is feeble and I have problems listening to the person on the other end

"
"

  Best phone in this price range. Big screen, great camera, great build quality, great speakers with loud sound. Voice clarity is great too.And no malware or ads.

"
"

  Camera are average but u used gcam to improve your picture quality GCAM image processing are soo good then stock camera app of nokia.After you use GCAM you will never face in any issues in camera quality.

"
"

   It's a nice phone. Good battery life, good camera, smooth operation. Android one is awesome. Built quality is very good, feels premium.Surely recommend.  You won't regret.

"
"

  Beast for this price of 12999 ... Loving it. I'm not sure why this product is getting negative reviews. The price is high for specs because it is Nokia. They have their own quality standard.

"
"

  This is Made in India , fairly good phone at this price point . So  happy to choose Nokia 5.3 over chinese peers.

"
"

  Was looking for a non-chinese brand phone with price around₹15k.  This one served my purpose.

"
"

  Ausome android experience.Toady i got September update .Really nice and secure phone.

"
"

  Nice one,but if there would be some features to change interface then it would have been better.

"
"

  Delay in Fingerprint, battery life is good and main camera quality average but macro camera is poor.

"
"

  Best Performance Mobile

"
"

  Absolutly worse resolution on the screen. Samsung is better than Nokia.

"
"

  Camera quality good.Battery backup very goodOverall performance awesome

"
"

  I didn't find this as too good it's okay type

"

"
"

  Good phone

"
"

  Nice mobile phone for me

"
"

  A phone with below average specs., below average battery, below average screen, below average performance and so on. Very high price compare to specifications. Dont waste your hard earning money on this scrap. In this price range, you'll get phone with better specs.

  Two weeks of usage and the display suddenly turns to pink and now i have to visit their horrible service center,thay planned to make a comeback without realizing that service is most important part of any product.Won’t be taking this risk againUnfortunately i cannot give o starsService center told me the display got damaged and will not be covered in warranty,worst brand and service,purchase at your own risk

  That's why they say Nokia is Nokia. No clutter. World-class design. No crappy pre-loaded apps like other phones in the same category. No nonsense phone.Of course, the beauty of a picture not measured by pixels the camera has. A monkey can ruin a photograph with a million pixel camera!If you want a neat experience, go for this.Thank me later.And am still waiting for Pureview 9.3. Hope to have it soon.

  A non-chinese mobile phone that gives value for money.Camera is not that great.Fast charging is also absent.Other than these 2, I feel the phone is worth money spent .
