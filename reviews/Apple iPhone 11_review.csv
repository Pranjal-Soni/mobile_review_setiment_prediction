  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.

  Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.

  Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.

"
"

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.

  My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn‚Äôt Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It‚Äôs producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can‚Äôt do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone üò¢ Better Go for shop To buy apple products .

  Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren‚Äôt working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren‚Äôt working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don‚Äôt regret after.

  The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .

  I purchased an iphone 11 from this seller on 20th july, 2020 and it got delivered on 21st July. When I checked the phone settings it showed that the warranty is expiring on 29th March 2021. So the phone was already activated in March 2020, this seller repacked and sold this iphone labelled as a brand new phone.

  In my opinion, don‚Äôt  think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the differencePros-1. Best Camera2. Best Security3. Long day Battery Life4. Touch ID improved5. Its an iPhone after all . üòç6. Best Night-mode support7. Best Processors A13 Bionic ChipCons-1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn‚Äôt matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 83. Thick bezelsGuys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.Got for it Guys !!!

  This is a big scam. I received the iphone 11 yesterday and it turned out to be a defective piece . The audio doesn‚Äôt record when you are recording a video. Multiple other issues like phone not turning on even after being on full charge . So it says 10 days replacement on this. So I clicked on it and Amazon says we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact Apple . Apple says our service Centers are not having any slots so we can‚Äôt do anything you should contact amazon . What is this ? You torture a customer as soon as you make money . And that too for such en expensive phone . I demand a replacement for my phone right now Amazon ! Don‚Äôt play with people‚Äôs hard earned money . Guys stay away from this Apple days sale .

"
"

  Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.Edit - I returned this phone and got refund from amazon and bought the same from flipkart ..and it got no issues .

"
"

  Provided with defective product .Struggling for replacement since then .There are so many hidden terms and conditions.It's my last order on Amazon

"
"

  If its just looks what you want then go ahead and buy...but its performance..then suggest you guys to back off.I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up. Show some sense of urgency towards customer issues.Ok...folks its upto you to buy or not, just sharing my own experience so it will help who are thinking to buy this.

  This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.

  helloPlease dont take any apple products online , especially if the seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd.I bought iphone 11 last month and suudenly today (17/08/2020) the phone got switched off and not getting switched on again.It was neither damaged nor it got wet in rains . I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller.

  Its my first iphone and now I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôve wasted my money coz it has heating issues

  This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.

  Samsung s10 is much better than iphone 11

  This is my 5th iPhone, iPhone 3G, 3Gs, 4S, 6 and now 11. Have used iPhone 6 more than 3.8 years.It is true when you keen to precision then nothing else can compete with the iPhone.Love the Portrait modes, wide-angle and the screen size.iPhone ring, a new tone is available now.Jio took only 30 minutes to activate the Esim.

  The phone seems to be owned by some shivang gupta earlier...he has all his details filled in...it's dishearting to know that an esteemed company like apple and amazon woul provide it's users a second hand device. This needs serious and immediate attention.Regards,Deputy directorBureau of Indian standardsMinistry of consumer affairs and public distributionMinistry of consumer affairs

  Not good when I charge mobilebody was earth (current shock) and today charger not working I don‚Äôt no how to replace

"

  Pathetic Amazon service!! Don't buy online. My back camera has problem,  shows many green dots. Apple store is of little help. Amazon as expected,  is of NO help. Waiting to get this resolved. I preferred this over pixel just for camera!!!  Sigh!!!

"

  I found this black spot while doing set up. Given me defective piece & now not able to give for replacement also. It's a very next day of purchase.

  hiI had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon.But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to serversFinding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work finebut it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to worktoday while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not workingI have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain

"
"

  This phone is bit big to hold but good for Android users.As per the design review, the phone is excellent with great camera both normal and wide angle, a good sound quality and the replicate feature was awesome to to copy data from old iPhone to your new iPhone.

"

  This I phone11 model {black} looks like Chinese phone.I suggest don't purchase and go with Iphone's other model.

  The worst phn I have bought,started to heat up badly the very first time I switched it on ,Moreover it heats up everytime when I switch it on.Tried returning it to apple they denied,don't buy it from amazon

"

  I Ordered on 24 January 2020 already i am having three issues in that bluetooth is not working, Phone is getting hanged and battery back up is to low the product is defect it's just 6 Days i have purchased it's so bad experience which i never thaught off .

"
"

  Awesome phone great camera quality .

"
"

  There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it‚Äôs only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ? Although since it‚Äôs Amazon fulfilled I was care free that there would no Damage only after 2 days I was able to notice the damage although everything else looks fine . It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it . If not then I think I would not be buying any electronics product  from Amazon it better to buy from store co I can check everything on the spot .

"

  Happy Fillings

"

  Phenomenal is the word , apple finally clicks in India with its predatory pricing and top notch feature which makes it hard to let go.The battery is running strong and the added extra camera is a plus. Apple you aced this one.

  My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.

  If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future.

"
"

  the product is good and working up to expectations....sorry for miss understanding the issue and I was under the impression that the product was defective...as I wasn‚Äôt hearing the voice of other person speaking....this happened because of thin flap of covering on screen

  Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware.

  Got it on 8 th Aug did not open it due to corona . Had to travel  to hp so put it into use 4 days back There is a problem with sound very low sound have to put it on speaker to hear the conversation . How can a new brand phone have this problem kindly look into it . Also in this corona time the return/replace window should be a little more relaxed as we senior citizens will not take this risk of using it immediately . Kindly look into the matter asap

  First i would like to write about the Online Shopping Platform : AMAZON.Amazon is and i believe will be the best and the most trusted e-commerce brands in the country.Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there.But my answer would be, GO FOR IT.I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC.No doubts remain anymore.Well that being said, nothing is permanent.I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone.Keep it up.Good delivery, on time.Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight.I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints.Delivery: Good.Product Packaging: Very Good.Notifications: Good.Shopping Experience: Good.About the product, well you guys, know about it very well already.One stop shop for all my shopping needs.AMAZON is the way to go !

  Camera is too good, smooth touch, fantastic sound quality, fantastic look, and performance is too good

"

  From 5s to 11

"
"

  You won‚Äôt regret it If you buy it .Camera quality is awesome and performance of this phone is next level. Lucky to have this phone in pocket

"

  Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!

  Received Defective, Screen Bleeding Issue

"
"

  After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that it‚Äôs totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, it‚Äôs been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only!If you‚Äôre looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it!There are a few bugs however, but they‚Äôre iOS bugs which‚Äôll be sorted soon I‚Äôm sure with upcoming updates!

"
"

  NEVER GO FOR AMAZON IF IT'S I PHONE....Had some issues with lock screen... When informed and asked for replacement, Amazon agents said me to visit a I store...There is more chance of getting a refurbished phone in the name of new phone... Be careful... Don't buy goods of this worth from online sites...

"
"

  Awesome phone!! Specially if you‚Äôre upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!

"
"

  Received faulty phone.Don't buy here, buy from store. I am suffering from a problem with this phone but Amazon is directing me to the iPhone store now rather than return or replacement, so what's the point in purchasing from amazon.

"

  Camera is Defective.

  Battery Life-Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big timeCamera-Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honestSound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notchProcessor- The bestScreen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCDValue for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro

  It‚Äôs just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don‚Äôt have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won‚Äôt go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.

  Buttery smooth with superb display comparable to Samsung's super amoled(but lacks contrast nd easy on eyes)Awesome cameraLcd has its own benifit(features like true tone combines to give best lcd in market now)Cons are few but major isheating up a bit(but mostly during gaming)13.1.2 is little buggy software update might solve all issues...Overall device is bang for bucks

  Please do not buy this

  I have received this product with defective speakers. Amazon is saying to visit Apple website. I have no clue what to do in this regard? At first place you send us a defective product and instead of initiating a replacement you ask us to visit Apply store. Is this even fair?

  I‚Äôve always been fascinated with iPhones but never bought one, due to lockdown I had postponed my shopping for few months but my older phones was bugging me a lot so I had to buy new one,At first I wasn‚Äôt sure about online shopping for iPhone but this pandemic left me no choice, ultimately I ordered after a long contemplation and I should say I‚Äôm happy with the purchase... I wouldn‚Äôt keep using it and then I‚Äôll update my review according to my experience

"

  Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.

  Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up üëç¬† for that.Let me talk a little about the phone üì±. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.‚úÖ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.‚úÖ All-day battery life.‚úÖ A great degree of water & dust resistance.‚úÖ Wireless charging‚úÖ An extra ultra-wide camera‚úÖ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)‚úÖ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.A high recommendation for this product.

  a bad and defective piece iphone11 was delivered to me . Battery, Camera etc are substandard. Phone gets heated even while talking. Its takes 8 hours to do full charge. seller has given me a defective product

  Awesome

  I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years.Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.

"

  Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..

  Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price.

"
"

  Excellent phone so far. Bought it for more secure access. Fortunately amazon delivery this time was good (my past delivery experience have been bad).On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy.  Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.I can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing

"
"

  The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn‚Äôt up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung‚Äôs A 30‚Äôs which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can‚Äôt help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo‚Äôs with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn‚Äôt take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would‚Äôve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!

  Well i received a proper iPhone not a brick. üòõReceived it in 2 days of order, everything as hopped and beyond expectations (expectation was receiving a brick in box üòÇ)They have improved their services and we can trust on amazon to deliver what they show.Thanks for discount and no cost options

  So the charger adapter is the old the 5w one but in other videos i have seen it has the new one i feel like something is wrong.

  I am having Mike n speaker issue, n due to lockdown I dint got chance to return it, but I dint expected this Frm amazon surely not with product like APPLE

"

  Had preordered it arrived at the same day when it was officially out on retail store. Prompt delivery and with excellent packaging. Been using a few days and for me it‚Äôs an excellent upgrade from 7 to 11. Full review I will be dropping later after few days of regular usage. N I love the pastel green color üòä

  From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.

  I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.

  I have recieved this product from Appario retail on 14th Jun and the handset is not detecting SIM card. I have also got the handset checked at unicorn Apple service centre ,Defence colony Delhi , who have confirmed in writing  that the handset is defective. I want the product to be returned or replaced at the earliest

  Everything about this phone is amazing!And Amazon‚Äôs delivery is glitch-free. Order without a care!Received a perfectly sealed box, and inside was this beauty.Anyone looking for an upgrade from the iPhone6/7/8 should definitely consider this cause this phone is leagues ahead.The Camera Quality is amongst the best so far.Low Light Pictures take some time.Battery- A full charge lasts more than a day‚Äôs use with moderate usage.

  My best purchase this year so farüòç. I purchase most of the electronics from Amazon and this prime day sale was a cherry on top. Talking about the colour scheme- very pretty and different. Battery life is amazing, the display, the face recognition, everything is amazing. Iphones are pricey, but the processor and everything is just amazing. Please make sure that you update your iphones to their latest version for smooth functioning. Overall very much satisfied with this one. And this is my mom with the mirror selfie as she loved the colour and was very much excited to click. üíö

  Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will be use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.

  The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn‚Äôt respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it‚Äôs been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it‚Äôs the worst product from Apple. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it‚Äôs not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn‚Äôt work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don‚Äôt find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.

  The only word to use for this Phone would be ""Perfect"". It's a perfect piece of art. I was fed up from using android phones and just wanted to move to the ios Platform. I was confused Between iPhone X and iPhone 11 and after a lot of Research and Youtube Searches, I Chose iPhone 11 and trust me it was one for the best decisions of my life. The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.Pros -- Camera is Amazing- Water-resistant- 4K Recording- Fluid Smooth touch- Never Lags in Heavy Gaming- And 100s of more ProsCons -- Haven't found any yet !!!So if you want to Switch to ios platform from android then just go for it and Chose iPhone 11 as your next device.

  Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life. This phone is a must buy!

  Bought it at 59k on prime day . Worth every single penny . If you are thinking about buying it just go ahead and buy it . I was an android user from the very beginning . My first android phone was moto g first gen then came oneplus 3t , asus zenfon 5z , and at last black shark 2 . Finally I decided to switch to ios since i own myself an ipad and MacBook pro . Trust me I regret nothing . The OS is so smooth like a hot knife through a butter . I am happy that i choose ios over android . I dont care much about customisations. All i need is good camera smooth os without any bloat wares . If you are looking for the same go for it

  This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.

  I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.

  I have been an iPhone user 8 years now. The battery backup is very much improved in iPhone 11. Performance is great.Highlighting an issue which happened for me but was resolved. May help others as well.After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice.

"
"

  If you are going from Android to IOS, You are going to suffer on few things:- Google provides 15 GB storage for google photos.- ICloud provides only 5 GB Storage and always ask for the money to buy storage as notification.- You will not be able to move or restore your whats app data from Android to IOS without using any 3rd party paid software.>>>Pros<<<<<- Camera Quality is Awesome.- Battery is OK.- Look is awesome.- Face Recognition is also OK.- Sound is nice.- Touch experience is top notch for the Android users.- Single SIM can be inserted and 2nd SIM would be eSIM and will have to visit Airtel store or JIO Store.>>>>>Cons<<<<<<- iCloud storage is low for photos.- Battery would have been better.- Earphone/EarPods or charger cannot be used as the sametime.

  Gets heated up while playing heavy games, and even if kept on full brightness for more than 30 mins.You‚Äôll also notice the low quality of the screen while watching videos on youtubeotherwise it‚Äôs a great phone, been using esim (Jio) + physical sim (Vodafone) , works flawlessly

"
"

  After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.

  Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucksCamera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the bestFace recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.

  Phone is stylish and i am first time apple user .its look good and it would be too early to comment as i got the phone today only. I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.  I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later. Thank you

  Worth the cost.Battery  life is good. After 40hrs of moderate use 35% of battery was still remaining.The usage was with location,Bluetooth ,mobile data turned off ,wifi on and display brightness set for the lowest possible for viewing  clearly.Display , touch, faceid is good. Face id doesn unlock if eyes are closed.Camera clarity is too good along with night mode.Adapter in the box is not satisfactory. I have a fast charge capable  power bank and charge my iphone by using power bank. So 30 to 100 % charge happens in about 1hr.

  Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.

  First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.The Battery backup is decent.The Sound Quality is nice.Face recognition is really fast.Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.Hope this helps ! ‚úåüèº

  I'm new to apple world. Initialy i hv faced many issues for esim, no netwrk, Pics arrangement, data transfr to iphone. But after a week, all my issues shorted out. M enjyng the best camera. Initialy m a oneplus user. Addicted to best cameras. Researchd alot to buy this iphone 11. Amazon prime gave me this iphone 128gb for 63k for whch i'm soo grateful to it. In love with this camera.

  Avoid iphone 11. Save your money. I feel its better to wait for the next iphone or get yourself another phone altogether. Apple‚Äôs standards are dropping year by year. But the price is instead rising over the roof with bad products

  Look at my new phone, and its sweet color!! Thanks to Amazon and the special guy who gifted me this phone! This is a great choice‚ù£Ô∏è

  Right choice to upgrade for iPhone 6/6s/7 user. Battery life is excellent. Presently it lasts for 36 hours for me.Camera- one of the best, if compared with other brand.Only cons- the phone box does not contain any separate connector to connect the wired earphone. You have to use the same earphone which came with the box. Otherwise go wireless.

  I am writing this review after one week of my purchase from Amazon,Actually I was waiting for iPhone 12.but due to lots of delay information.i changed my mind to buy iPhone 11.And I am very happy with this phone.the Phone is amazing.but it takes almost three hour to full charge that makes me so disappointed.and lots of reviewer are saying about heating issue and they are also saying don‚Äôt buy from Amazon. But I didn‚Äôt got any issue like this.So I will say go for it without any second thought.100 percent Orginal product.Thanks Amazon thanks seller and thanks to delevery boy.thank you everyone.

  I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Apple üçé

  I purchased this product during Amazon Great Indian Festival sale and received it at ‚Çπ47,999. It was a nice deal. This phone fulfils all my requirements as expected. Battery life is awesome. Face biometric is too good and light weighted. Please purchase a back cover for additional protection to the glass back. Screen is too big to be handled with a single-hand.Previously I used to use iPhone 7 and the major jump to iPhone 11 has been a complete worthy experience. Apple products are premium and are worth the price. Thanks to Amazon also for working with such reputable sellers who meet customer expectations. Overall a nice experience.

"
"

  Pros:Camera quality is 09/10.Display 09/10Battery life 10/10Heating issue : I face no heating issueProduct genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.

"
"

  Too pricey,Gifted it to sister. Before making a whatsapp video call I have to call her first becuase sound of video calls is too low for one to notice. Many other Ease of use issues, this was just a practical example.You charge 65k for a phone and cannot provide basic things and annoy people.

"
"

  I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ...

"
"

  I have always been an iPhone fanatic and it‚Äôs really worth it. I really would like to thank the seller and amazon delivering the product during covid 19 and that too before the mentioned delivery time.The performance of the phone is amazing compared to any phone in the market. I love the facial rec and the camera quality a lot with different modes.NOTE: I would suggest the seller to correct the bullet points or spec where it is mentioned that the phone come with AIRPODS.

"

  After lot of comparison among iphone 11, samsung s20 and one plus 8 pro (As all three in some or other offer are available for price just under 60000Rs), I went ahead with iphone 11.It‚Äôs my first flagship phone and I am totally loving it. It‚Äôs camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge. Face recognition works well even in dark conditions and is fast but it don‚Äôt work with a mask.

"
"

  Superb. It‚Äôs a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don‚Äôt think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can‚Äôt multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?

"

  I just upgrade my iphone6 to iphone11 and its a game changer for me...Prons:-Camera:- Best in class no one can beat itBattery:- Good battery life at one chargeSoftware:- A13 Bionic which make this phone super fast. Best in industryFace Id:- No one can give you fast face unlock. Apple nailed it againLooks:- Premium Phone with Premium look. Black colour is like JawdropCons:-Charger:- still 5W chargerScreen:- No HD display. only 720pNotch:- Very thick Notch which make this phone oldWeight:- Lil bit heavyOverall:- 8/10 Worth buy it

  If u have points and planning for not changing phone 2to 4 year that iPhone 11 is best optionIt‚Äôs my first purchase of iPhone from one plus 5T i am also thinking about its price but after some coupons and amazon icici credits point and cash back, it‚Äôs make me happyAbout iphone11Processor is awesome there is no lagCamera and haptic touch is very goodI seen heating problems in some comment I think those people don‚Äôt know how to use mobile data optionBattery performance and charging also awesome as campare to XRIt‚Äôs display very good and mr/miss siri is equal to alexa relative.So if you are looking for premium phone with best performance go for it and don‚Äôt worry about features like 5G.in india 4G services still not good and 5G will take 3 yr to fully operational

"
"

  I thought may be not good as android but I felt better than android.The user experience is good.Even then also using android for 6years I never regretted about iPhone. All the necessary features are there in iPhone.In terms of piracy iPhone is best.

"
"

  Guys I have learned that there are two types of screen display color in iPhone 11. One is with yellow tint and other one is blue tint.  And my phone which I got from amazon is yellow tint which is very low in brightness. Blue tint is good and brighter. Do not purchase yellow tint phones. Not happy with amazon service as they are not exchanging to blue tint.

"
"

  Camera is okay but not that great as it was advertised and we can not say it as the world‚Äôs best camera in any smartphone because Rear camera is more than good but the selfie camera is not much good. It has a quality which we can get in ‚Çπ30,000-40,000 range smartphone. So I will give only 3 out of 5 star for the camera and for remaining other things like processor, performance, battery life etc. ‚Äúthese are just great‚Äù and will give 5 out of 5 stars rating!!I‚Äôm just unhappy for the camera only!And I think this is the most unbiased review!

"
"

  After upgrading from iPhone 6 it feels quite good to use a flagship model like this. Camera quality is awesome, battery backup is way better compared to the previous models of iPhone, A13 Bionic chip is really powerful, if you‚Äôre a gamer you must own this device, PUBG,Asphalt etc runs smoothly in this device but the device heats up while playing games. We‚Äôll go for the pro or pro max model if you wish to have a telephoto lens along with OLED display along with silver coating which feels premium, else you may go for this . I really welcome android users to have this device , it‚Äôs literally a beast in all aspects

"
"

  This is the one brand for which i was waiting for four years, literally i purchased this mobile only for brand, many of them have a dream to buy a apple from own money as i also had and it took me four years, After the use of more then ten days am posting this review am very much happiee with the performance of this beauti,, especially the camera is the biggest pros

"
"

  The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‚Äòin-house‚Äô card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards.

  Here‚Äôs my long term review on IPhone 11 64GB. I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.WiFi reception is Average I would say.Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crispThe speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love itThe display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurateBattery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.The phone is slippery so I use a back case.Nothing more to say about i0S and it‚Äôs updates they are great

"
"

  In love with this amazing product!!!!

"
"

  It‚Äôs a monster. But a good one though. A true beast among phones. Awesome camera, battery life, sound, processing and face recognition. Me, and my spouse, both are using iPhone 11 and we both are real happy with the product. She has got red one and mine is black. Totally satisfied with iPhone 11 and got at nice rate. No issues till now. Thanks to Apple and Amazon. A perfect purchase if you have got enough money üòà

  Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen.After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.Horrible experience with #Amazon. üò≠Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone. Further I don't have idea for battery, face recognition and camera as I was not able to use iphone 11 and till now I have only bitter experience.

"
"

  Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-‚Ä¢Wide angle camera‚Ä¢Supports fast Charing‚Ä¢Stunning looks‚Ä¢Superb Camera quality‚Ä¢Safe and secure device ‚Ä¢Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-‚Ä¢The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp‚Ä¢Still have huge notch‚Ä¢Bit costly in India

  got the phone delivered within a day . Excellent service. But I guess the responsibility ends there itself.  the product is faulty .  Screen flickers ,  touch screen becomes un-responsive,  screen black out for a  few seconds is common and above all the  iphone heats  up horribly  to an extent that it made me uncomfortable holding the phone.  having read on  google now, it seems the product is faulty and heating is a common problem.  Fed up of liaising with Apple  & Amazon . hoping it will be replaced

"
"

  Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.  Some other good features: - Stereo speakers with great quality. - iOS provides smooth user experience. - The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good. - Amazing video quality - Excellent selfie photos.Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase of mine.

  I never go by reviews. I have done intensive research differentiating between android and iOS. I previously was a big fan of Symbian OS. No wonder the most robust system in those days. Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android.

  The phone got delivered on 19 jan 2020 and I am facing current problem on camera side, it is giving slight current.It‚Äôs been 6 month can I return the product ?Very much disappointed suddenly sound drops and get into silent mode...this product is not at all good portrait mode is worst in camera

  Got the phoneWithin 10 days it started randomly shutting down.Apple says it's a hardware problemBut amazon is not replacing it because return window ended 2 days back.Amazon customer care representative clearly said that it's not amazon problem.They have washed off their hands.BEWARE OF AMAZON!!!!

  Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don‚Äôt need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn‚Äôt agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don‚Äôt know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.

  I have upgraded from Iphone 7 to this & it‚Äôs really COOL üòé. Just go for it amazing camera specially the night mode and portrait. Just to add one thing  it‚Äôs battery dies in one whole day after full charge. Though it depends you use this as personal or professional. I use this as professionally with high no of calls per day using this personally battery life I think will be much much higher as compared.

"
"

  Genuine review(not paid): I have been using the Android system all my life and this is my first iPhone. Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.Thanks.

"
"

  Worth buying! It‚Äôs an extraordinary device! The only flaw I would say is the display! If you compare side by side to Amoled displays this display will feel dull! But it‚Äôs more than enough for a smartphone m! The the purpose of smartphone are many not just media consumption! And hey guys all this will be noticed only when you compare it!What I say is don‚Äôt compare! Coz this iPhone is far far better in its performance and usage irrespective of LCD display! ..especially the photos, video recording, editing, ppt, browsing, everything you throw at it! It does with ease.. an EASY YES for this mobile..

"
"

  After reading the reviews I completely scared about the authenticity of the phone. I would like to thanks to all people who made me aware in such a way that Firstly I verified my phone before even putting the SIM card.I got the brand new iPhone with no technical or physical glitches. Thanks to Amazon and apparition retail.Phone is working flawlessly. Registered on Apple site and got warranty of one year.Rest of the features are already described.

"
"

  Apple - another masterpiece. Camera is so real followed by powerful processor. Such a superior experience so far. Hope this continues!Amazon - Delivery in less than 24 hours, you just nailed this prime thingi. Although i followed up, but you fullfilled your promise as usual. Kudos and thanks for delivering the device in such a perfect way... thank you...

"

  Unfortunately charger and ear plugs found missing in the package.Customer care fails to compensate in this regard.Worst purchase I have ever seen

"
"

  ¬†iphone 11 is the perfect iphone, best mixture of performance and battery life.A must buy if you are looking for a best in class camera, performance and battery.

"
"

  I think Apple's phones that make it different.This is my first phone.  I have never used Apple's phone before.It is known only after using it.I don't understand that the other company makes 64 megapixel cameras, but Apple's 12mp gives a good picture, why?

"
"

  The best phone in the market for this price. I bought the phone before lockdown  and I am thankful to god that it proved to be one of the best decisions I took. You do not have to worry about anything, just charge it and the battery doesn‚Äôt not drain out for at least 12 hours. I am in back to back office calls for more than 8 hours. So this product is worth every Penny invested in it. This is my 3rd iPhone...iPhone 3GS, iPhone 6 and then iPhone 11. I change it every 4-5 years and must say the old phone still support most of the apps i have in this. This is a great investment if you value your money and time.

"
"

  I don‚Äôt think the quality of phone is good. Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store.The phone hangs few times everyday. Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well. Didn‚Äôt hear all this from a friend who is using iPhone11 too. Must be a refurbished or low quality phone beng sold here.

  Since day one ive raised a return req and none has replied,i made return req again and again,but of no use..Amazon are u really helping customers about problems they ve raised? Pity on u amazon.....i just wasted my money through ur platform .... Shame on u

  Before placing the order on the prime day sale, I was very confused about the incredible offers they put up. My neighbour shop warned me about the refurbished phone. But negating all the confusion and risk, I ordered. And I got a perfectly normal brand new iPhone.I am writing this review just to let everyone out there, OFFERS ARE REAL. Grab them!!

  It‚Äôs just an ok phone with an Apple logo...Otherwise features are average, charging this phone takes ages, this is my first IPhone and I am regretting it...one may buy oneplus etc for better features and experience

  I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months.Build quality is remarkable.IOS 14 is a magic.Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.If you are a photo person, this one is for you.Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  üòÖThis is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.

  So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android.Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system.Hope with new release they will match with android.Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don‚Äôt even think of it.

  I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don‚Äôt work in angles.4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.

"
"

  Display is not at par. even after adjusting the colour settings. More of Yellow tint.Screen width is not suitable for e- reading in phone.Top notch is disturbance for watching videos in full screen.Keyboard is occupying half of the phone space.Camera, I think my expectations are on higher side.Side button disconnects the call and doesn‚Äôt lock the screen during the calls.However phone performance and sound are good.In my opinion I should have waited for iPhone 12.

"
"

  I am not impressed by the camera as it should be considering phones like Oneplus and google pixel 4. The night mode is good but other than this the camera does not have much to offer.Battery is okay.Processor is good. The size of iPhone 11 is 6.1inch which is more than pro variant.Overall average phone as compared to Oneplus and Google Pixel 4.

"
"

  Despite being a serious android user , after reading and researching a lot about iPhones , finally I decided to bought it , and to my surprise it turns out pretty well , yes the packing of Amazon was good but not up to the marks as this item would be considered costly item and so the packing should have been much better, the delivery time was good and intact I received it before only so full marks on the delivery process. Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it‚Äôs mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it‚Äôs little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it .If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this.

  My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it‚Äôs delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I‚Äôm the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there‚Äôs no question of sending refurbished device.Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S.  Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.Overall it‚Äôs great to have this phone.

  its amazing product.. very good looking red color.. 1st time iOS using .. it's small dificult to option. finally all good worth for money . go for it 128gb or 256gb...  4.7 out 5.pro; nice looking , good cam quality,display super,good finishing.right time received in only 2 days from order...earphones ..con; too late battery charging....2nd sim e sim mode.its dificult..only used single sim easy microsim method..in box not provide back  case cover and temprd glass.

"

  User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X. All in all, it sure is value for money, atleast for me.

"

  For me, its best at this price point. Upgraded from iPhone 6. Adequately fast and smooth with all day long battery life.Only disappointment was made the packaging, seller has just pack it into a polythene bag instead use of cardboard box for safety purposes of device and box as well. Box found damaged but device fount okay.

  I have received my iPhone 11 128GB black colour. My first online order for mobile and I was very worried that whether I would get the genuine product or not or may be they will send me defective damaged phone. There were so many doubts on my mind. But Iam a happy customer and Iam loving this iPhone. Thank you amazon and seller.

  Battery life. Has been improved when. Compared to previous generationsCamera quality is good and pretty decent enoughFace recognition is bit fast and smoothOverall build quality good enoughIt‚Äôs been five months phone is working excellent no issuesTrust me you can close your eyes and invest  and I suggest to club with spigen case so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about accidental damage

  +Excellent snappy phone if you don‚Äôt look pixels through microscope as it‚Äôs not an OLEd panel+ Good full day battery+ excellent water and splash resistance coming handy during now in COVID+ good main camera, low light is good as well, don‚Äôt use much of wise angle-slow charge-poor selfie camera- wide phone unfriendly gripping- slippery , use case- back glass smudge game- No hi res video support on YouTube- pricyIf an iOS sticker get this device if not get One plus 8pro with lesser amount

  If you are going for yellow colour don't expect a bright yellow rather it's a pale yellow...  Battery life is good... Very slim phone indeed... Best camera... Great low-light image's

"

  The product is very good, color is also good no issue with the device till now as its only a day of usage, but this time i am not satisfied with the package as per amount paid for the premium product. I ordered 3 item but they sent it all together in a single box which is not acceptable. What would have happended if the product received turnsout a damaged one, i know there is a policy of replacing but it was a birthday gift, had to send back and had to wait for extra more days. Many a times i have received a serum with proper packaging with bubble wrap but the iphone came with a lame packaging. Overall happy with the product.

  I've recently made a switch from the Android ecosystem to iOS. I'm totally in love with the smoothness of the UI the iPhone 11 provides. The studio light feature in the camera is supreme for portraits. Battery life is mediocre as I was using OnePlus phone before this one but the build quality is excellent. If you're even tad bit confused on whether or not it is a great buy, I'd say go for it. Definitely worth the price. Also, the delivery was smooth and hassle free.

"
"

  I am writing this review because before deciding to buy one for myself, I was going through the reviews and there were a quite a few of them mentioning that people should avoid buying an iPhone from Amazon.However, since I had a gift coupon from Amazon and Prime sale was offering me a superb deal, I decided to go for it.I got the hone delivered the very next day. Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.The phone itself is great, superb camera, looks good, excellent battery life. Truly worth the price especially if you are switching from Android.

"

  Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don‚Äôt have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It‚Äôs a big flaw in the AI part of this . Need to change on this part .Overall not satisfied

"
"

  So after reading 3-4 negative review I thought to not buy a premium phone on Amazon but I am seriously telling you not to consider these 3-4 negative review,so finally I ordered I phone 11 for my son and phone is doing great ,no problems are faced till now,and also I contacted amazon customer care executive they told me mam if you faced any problem call directly to us we will surely help you ,iam honestly telling you amazon is the best online shopping flatform ,they treat you like a family member , so overwhelming thank you amazon

  Very very addictive new iPhone

  I switched to iphone from oneplus 8 pro , i have been an oneplus user since 3t, but 8 pro was so bad  and full of problems so i finally decided to switch to iphone and literally this is so much better than 8 pro , 8 pro was just marketing . Even the screen on this phone is better than the 8pro . This phone is a beast in every department . I purchased it only because of amazon sale at 48,000 i am really glad for the sale otherwise the price was too high

  I always had an impression that iPhones are overrated and not worth the price. Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone. I love the phone, still find it a bit pricy but a great phone.

  Phone is perfect in all aspect just few things lacksBattery charging is slow even if I‚Äôm charging with Huawei 18 watt chargerAnd 2nd camera I would this could be bcz I‚Äôm coming from pixel 3xl and if i have to compare in 10 I would give 10 to pixel even though it didn‚Äôt have ultra wide lens and this I would give 6 .Only in 2 thing is got disappointed1 battery charging and backup2 camera

  I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).So don‚Äôt worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren‚Äôt functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people‚Äôs complaints.

  MRP on product is 69k for 128gb variant but Amazon is selling for 73.6k saying revised price after April‚Äô2020. Is this justified?Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviourNow come to the phone-Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible . I am using it as dual sim and not sure if it bcoz of this.Battery also taking too much time to get chargedMobile is heating after half an hour of use

"

  Handsdown to the best vfm apple product right now on the sale. I was so skeptical reading the negative reviews from the seller named - apparioBut then eventually things were pretty cool.Got it delivered within a day.And the box was sealed with no dents or anything crap which you might have read in the previous reviews. ‚úåüèª Also if you wanna jump to the ios ecosystem, you may opt for xr which was available for 36k during the sale, or even low for the SE2These products won't disappoint you ! üíØüíØüíØ

"

  The delivery got delayed by a day but the product came with good packaging and I have verified the product on Apple website to ensure that the product is genuine.Jio and Airtel offer esim in India, so be mindful when you read that iPhone supports dual sim. It supports one esim and one nano sim.Great camera. Bulkier than other older iPhone models. Display and sound quality is amazing!

  Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn‚Äôt quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn‚Äôt.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won‚Äôt allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ‚Çπ3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!

  Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.

  Camera quality and face recognition is amazing. First timers will have to spend time on setting up the phone as it is not as easy as android. The phone is not too big to hold nor too small. It‚Äôs just perfect and the performance is quite good since it has only been 1 day after I have bought it. Overall a very good product and I love it.

"
"

  An awesome phone from Apple. Worth buying!Camera Quality is undoubtably the best in outdoor ! Indoor seems to be good, not great.Battery was awesome, I heard iPhone battery never last for the day. But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery.iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it.

  Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :Positives:Price Point : Brought this at ‚Çπ46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chipSecure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editingGaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.What i Dislike:Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ‚Çπ68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ‚Çπ23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:

  Product : iPhone 11 (White, 128GB)Occasion : Amazon's Great Indian Festival, 2020Price : ‚Çπ49,999Seller : Apparel Retail Private Ltd., Tamil Nadu Key Points on Amazon :1) Received it by one and half day.2) No damaging or used product(Its Brand New).3) Warranty got applied only after booting up the device.4) I was worried about online fraud, but thank god this purchase isn't one.First impressions  &  Key points:1) Very premium phone.2) Loaded with features.3) Camera performance is good.4) Haven't tested battery yet, but seems to be good.5) Face ID is super fast.6) Glad to receive accessories[Feeling sad for people seeing it in coming years ;)]7) Back panel is extra prune to fingerprints. So, case is highly recommended.8) Same with front display. Suggest you to apply a tempered glass.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and impressed with Amazon and Seller for this experience.PS: These are 1st impressions, I'll be reviewing it again.

"
"

  So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone üò¢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.

  Great Phone.  I have shifted my phone from iphone 6 S Plus to Iphone 11 (128GB Green).  Picture quality is awesome.  This is my home pic taken with (0.5x) camera option, it covered flooring to ceiling, really crazy with this. Remaining all features are TOP.  I booked this phone in Amazon from Appario Retail Private Ltd (seller).  He delivered my phone in on time. iPhone 11 is Little bit expensive but great selection from iphone.  Thankyou, RK

  No complaints yet awesome mobile loved night mode camera

  This is my first iphone. After using android for so long didn't exoect to like ios so much. So yes ios is more refined compared to android. Iphone is costly yes but now a days highend android and iphone doesnt have much difference in terms of price. But when it comes to build quality, speaker sorround sound, camera quality, smoothness of ios, display even if in lcd i felt there is no comparison. Its just different league. I dont need customisation so i am liking ios better. But if u are more into customization thing then u may go for android. And final verdict.. Iphn 11 is a complete package and a real value for money. I really enjoy using it.

"
"

  I want to return the product because it looks like a refurbished one however no one is contacting with me not taking order. Please do no buy it because its not a new product and also you can not return it

  I received a damaged product with scratches all over

"

  Mobile is not catching the network exactly after 2 weeks. Now the worst thing is it stopped accessing the WiFi also. Changed the Sim done everything but the result is same. After spending the money on the best brand the product delivered is faulty one. Never expected this from Amazon.

  One of the amazing phone from apple. Insane pic quality. Improved battery life, face recognition is way faster than its previous ones. Amature photographers will like it for sure :).Overall experience is good enough.

"

  Phone design and build looks premium. Camera quality is excellent and night mode works really well. Battery life is awesome lasts for a day or little more than that on moderate usage.Pros:Battery lifeSecurity - I moved from android so I can feel the differenceFace ID - works even on pitch dark environmentBest processor A13 BionicBest cameraCons:Display could be been Oled or amoled. It‚Äôs just Liquid Retina displayOther than that excellent device to use. Can feel the performance without any lags what so ever.

  I ordered iphone 11 64GB red on 16th octomber Great Indian Festival and got delivery on 18th octomber. after unboxing iphone switch on the device .try to capture some images and video the iphone backpanel is getting heated.on normal use like watching  videos getting heated ,even i havent install any appilcation on device.after contacting with apple support care they advice to upgrade OS version (from 13.7 to 14.0.1) but issue same . I ask to amazon for replacement or return ..but they saying that they dont have authority to replace/refund you have to go for service centre.if they dont have authority to replace/refund why they selling apple product.its just only 1 day after purchased and i had raised the issue even they have the 7 day replacement policy.So dont go on amazon for expensive product..think 100 times while buying..

"

  This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone. The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android. And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It‚Äôs been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can‚Äôt beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation.

"

  Bought it for my son for birthday gift. Perfect product. Checked genuineness from the menu and it was original with one year warranty activated with today‚Äôs date. Was little worried with few of the reviews about the seller. But very satisfied as bought on Apple days which gave a discount of 5400 /-

"
"

  My review after 7 months of use ... battery health at 96%... that is mostly because I use a fast charger now and then else the health would have been at ~98%... yes the phone heats up at load and when plugged even interaction with the phone is hard as the temp go crazy ... never was concerned about the storage as I use cloud ... it‚Äôs fine ... will update his post later a year ... I invested in the phone for the long 6+ years S/W support ...

  Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.

  I was an iPhone 7 user earlier. I switched to this 11 after my old phone broke. It is a superb experience while using it. Specially when you upgrade from old iPhone to this iPhone 11. The colour purple is awesome. I loved the look and camera quality is much better. Battery life is very well. Only thing is it takes around 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Otherwise best phone in market.

"
"

  Apple products are usually very handy to use. This is awesome phone with very good touch in operation and good picture. Bit disappointed with battery backup as it gets exhausts by end of day with limited application running in background. Many new features like in built scanner and full page screen capture is very useful and easy to send and share. Very good Face ID detection.

"
"

  iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos

  Amazing!!!!!

  My phone had issues during updating / restoring from iOS 13 to iOS 14. Tried updating it multiple times with restore mode and it worked after 4-5tries. Today I tried updating from iOS 14 to iOS 14.1 and I am getting same issue. Update gets stuck at waiting for iPhone or verifying update with iPhone. Tried with multiple cables/networks/computers, but no use. Will try my best again to update it, if it doesn‚Äôt will try to return.

  Phone is too good, but fell and broke the display in a week of purchase.Apple care did not agree to change the display and pay 40k n get it replaced.

  (Writing this review after using one month)1. Starting with built quality, I assure you will get the best premium feel.2. Camera is just awesome,rare and front both.3. If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.4. The face id works butter smooth.5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation

  Product delivery was good.First I was worried to buy from amazon but I got a genuine product.Thanks Amazon.About Phone:1. Battery is good but slow charging2. Camera is not as expected3. Overall experience is averageNot value for money

"
"

  One word - wonderfulBattery life - Very Good. Will take you through the day and to the next if you are an average user. Heavy users can rely on the battery for one full day. The phone doesn‚Äôt really heat up except while using some heavy apps (once in a while). But not bad at all.The camera is great, as expected.Face recognition is awesome. My phone recognises me even in the dark. And thankfully the phone recognises me and only me. Quite smart üòÉI have used the phone for over a month now.

"
"

  To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)

  The most flowed Apple product,Received Apple 11 (128GB)on Saturday 8th August .And review in 9th August ,Please spare a movement before buying The  Apple product.The touch and proximity sensors won't work .The wifi and touch have huge response delay ,The sellers have should have mentioned that product sold can't be replaced (other than contacting Apple support center )The worst experience of what could have ever experience for Appple products.Trust me don't ever buy Apple products from this platform ,The seller has no accountability and platform is not transparent on return details .Most un trust worth experience

  An android user reviewIt is more convenient than android and more simpler. At 1st 2 ,3 days u may face problems.  But gradually u will adapt to it. It lacks many android features. But considering better camera,powefull processor, good battery life. This is a good smartphone.  Morever its apple.  It gives more security than android.  Iam very much happy to have it

  Hi. I have received my iphone 11 white 64 gb on 7th September 2020. The charger is not working properly. Its not charging my phone properly as its very slow. I want a new charger as soon as possible. I am using iphone since 2015 and this is not how a iphone charger charges the phone. I have used a different charger on my iPhone 11 and its charging properly. I request you to please send provide me a new charger.

"
"

  First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.

"
"

  Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can‚Äôt be beaten by any other device. It‚Äôs really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also.  I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue. Which is not a big issue.

  Got this for unbelievable price of Rs. 51.2k for iPhone 11 128GB.... this product needs no reviews as it is the best iPhone available currently in non-pro series.. Battery life is just amazing... need to charge once in 2 days...Thanks Amazon for the huge discount...

"
"

  Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured! The packet was opened in front of me (after confirming my identity!) and I was asked to check the contents before delivery. You will enjoy carrying iPhone 11. Feel proud & Go for it!üëç

  Bought this mobile in great Indian festival for 46k with all.possiblr discounts... I have seen few reviews and also youtubers videos that its a defective product or clone mobile... But I received genuine product with full warranty... E comm giant like amzon will not do fraud maybe some of there employees or delivery boys can do this type of things... Will this is my honest review ...I am not paid to review this nor I received anycashback offer for this review its just that I have seen so many reviews and videos so thought of sharing this...

"
"

  It took only 2 days after the order to get this phone. Working fine as expected. No issue so far... Face detection is excellent.

"
"

  Thanks to Amazon's ""The Great Indian Shopping Festival"" I got the best deal for this phone compared to other sites. I think I was one of the early bird to avail this great offer. It would be stupid to give a phone review for a year old phone but for me it's perfect piece of machine at a very reasonable price. Special mention goes to the early delivery made by the Amazon courier service.Thank you Amazon for this wonderdul deal.

"

  Great mobile for the price I bought during Prime sale for 46k(including cashback on hdfc card).Ordered at 12am midnight and received it on next day morning, so delivery was speed enough*Was quite worried about how genuine it'll be since Appario retail Pvt Ltd was the seller. But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!üòä

"
"

  Awesome camera, long lasting battery and neat performance.. Display is good if you don't have anything to compare. Battery charging is very slow.Removed a star just for the display and charging speed, everything else is awesome.

"
"

  So I got my hands on this beautiful purple iPhone 11 and it feels amazing.I upgraded from iPhone 8 to 11 and tbh the 3 year old iPhone 8 is still in the best condition .This is what makes me go for iPhone again and again .I‚Äôve had android in the past and the thing that keeps me loyal to iPhone is that it gives me ZERO LAG and the BEST PICTURE QUALITY.

"
"

  Bought iPhone from seller Appario Retail. Phone had multiple issues such as WiFi, mobile network (no network for 10 days), facelock was working on multiple people etc in just 3 months of use.I have given my phone to apple service center and its been 10 days and its not fixed.STAY very careful before buying from this seller.Read mutilple bad reviews and I think seller is selling defective phones.

"
"

  Wonderful product worth every money. After good study I bought this phone and met my expectations. No much difference between pro and pro max. If you really like stander quality of iPhone and real feel go for it.

"
"

  I‚Äôll be frank here.If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.Having said that, the phone is not bad.It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.Hope this helps.

"
"

  ¬†Clicked some pictures and recorded a wide angle video (may not be good as amazon compressed it here), but nothing can beat iPhone camera.Bought 2 iPhone11 during this festival sale. Amazing price and what can i say about phone, its the best out here.‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è For everything, prices, delivery time (1 day delivery), packaging.

"
"

  At first glance product as expected but when it was received the packaging was worst. It was simply put in amazon plastic packet  without any bubble wrapper or thermocal despite of pre paid of Half a lakh rupees. Amazon India must see into proper packaging system.

"
"

  Hi,Just got the iPhone 11 delivered, the speakers are damaged and the sound coming is all shaky and cracked.Really horrible and disappointing to have Apple product provide such a poor customer and product experience. Please refund my money

"
"

  I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.

"
"

  This is my second iPhone üì±. Needless to say  the quality of iPhone camera and iOS Experience  . Great experience. Battery is awesome. A13 is very efficient. Overall ‚ù§Ô∏è. The screen could have been AMOLED instead of LCD IPS.

"
"

  The delivery was fast it reached in 1 day. The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12‚Äôs)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn‚Äôt need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone.

"
"

  I brought this phone for 58k on prime day sale using my HDFC card .+ve : best camera , sufficient battery , smooth , A13 bionic chip , display ( doesnt feel like 720p display ) , speaker .! , colour , features-ve : no fast charger provided in the box , no telephoto lens at this cost , android users find it difficult initially .Overall , this is a perfect Iphone , and thanks amazon for fast delivery ..

"
"

  i wish to return this product, as per your return policy within 10 days from delivery date, i have trying to many time, but there is appearing to contact apple,  kindly return this phone , its a worthless phone , kindly resolve the same immediately

"
"

  Button placements were wrong and best place for power button is top (like previous versions) only. Now they kept like Android phones and whenever I want to increase volumes it takes screen shot. The phone also looks average and most of the time I mistook my wife android phone as my phone. Not very happy with iPhone11

"
"

  First time Iphone user, experience with Amazon is just awsome. Battery life 4/5, display 4/5, Camera 5/5, Speakers 5/5, Charger 1/5, Earphones 4/5, Performance 5/5, Face unlock 5/5, looks 5/5.Dual sim(esim) esim just a failure, bcz if you try to use dual sim option, esim always plays tricks with you like it goes offline & shows NO SERVICE, at the end of the day Iphone is just for single SIM..!ü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"
"

  Received a defective piece. There‚Äôs no option to replace. Apple store is 250kms away from my address.

"
"

  I am using the I phone 6s for the last 5 years. But this 11 is awesome for its clarity, very sensitive touch screen, sound system and photography. Size is more or less same as 6s.

"
"

  Everything is same as iPhone xr one camera is extra that is change everything.I dipped my phone in aquarium(water resistant IP68) phone is working perfectly.i am so excited in phone performance.i never used this type of phone.

"
"

  Its a really fun device to use and the battery life is quite good however the fun stops when you need to charge it. It just takes too long to charge on the Apple Charger that‚Äôs included in the box. The display is really good too, I had used an S8 before coming from OLED, it doesn‚Äôt matter the experience is amazing you won‚Äôt miss OLED because of this.  Speakers are great, color is awesome! Feels so good without the case i Have to use it without the case. Dual sim is working great too.

"

  bad

"
"

  Everyone talks about the good points like camera, battery or looks. I would focus to the bad points I found. It depends on the buyer who will refer what before investing.1. This phone has no fingerprint scanner.2. The camera app must have some exclusive features.3. The phone migration feature was troublesome for me.

"
"

  Really a wonderful product from apple. I'm a new user for apple product and this is my 2nd product after 8 years and price also I got 68600rs after using HDFC credit card. Initially I was afraid to buy from this seller after read some comment's from the site later I think to cancel too but now I'm holding a good product and I'm finally happy with the product

"
"

  The iPhone11 is a beast phone i mean the phone perfectly work in every field like the phone is very for Gaming,blogging,for pics and all its give u full security,privacy and protection so iPhone11 is alrounder.... And the most impressive things is the battery capacity of 11 is 3110mAh but it give u more battery life than 5000mAh android phones.... and last thing is Y I give 4star not 5 because iPhone11 comes with 5watt adaptor... comeon Apple we buy 68k phone and u give us 5watt adaptor... that it So my viewpoint is u can buy the best I mean iPhone11...

"
"

  Switching from iPhone 6s, iPhone 11 was such a good option. As there were battery issues with iPhone 6s but there are none with this one, absolutely great battery life. Also, the camera quality is way too enhanced... it‚Äôs damn awesome ! Plus, not to forget about the face unlock that precisely detects your face even when there‚Äôs less light. Talking about delivery and packaging, I received the package in proper conditions from amazon & there were no damages on the outside or inside of the package i.e. I received my phone as expected ! Absolutely happpyyy with this purchase, Thanks Amazon.

"
"

  I had been using android for more than 7 year so thought of changing the phone so bought iPhone 11 Green it been a month now it super smooth and battery is very good last a day or more depends on a user. Only drawback is cant back up whatsapp from android üôÉ so people who are thinking to buy just go for it with hesitation. And the delivery was super fast got my phone delivered within 14hrs

"
"

  I got this phone in amazon great Indian sale under 50k. This phone is September 2020 manufactured made in china..... I guess people who ordered green variant have received made in India version. No issues with the phone working buttery smooth....my only concern is the packaging was not good I got it in just plastic cover at least they should have packed it in cardboard considering the cost of the device.

"
"

  The 5W charger is really a pain....don‚Äôt know why Apple is providing it.It‚Äôs‚Äô staking more than 3.5 hrs to charge the iPhone full and the adapter is getting extremely heated after 30 mins or so.YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BUY AN 18W C CHARGER PLUS C CABLE if u want to get rid of this battery issue and be ready to shed an extra 5k.Rest I found an issue with the MEASURE app from the utilities section which makes the iPhone getting heated instantly within minutes of use.Anyone having the same issues ??suggestions are most welcome.

"
"

  Over a good phone but display is bad... my one plus 5t has a better display quality compared to this... battery is average , on medium or less usage will last for a day.... At times there are heating issues.... the price is high considering the average display and battery.... The positive point is that the OS is buttery smooth..... Camera is good but not great

"
"

  So I love it , colour is also awesome. And face recognition is too good, battery is good if will compare it from previous apple phone, but it take much time to charged up the phone.So you can go for it.

"
"

  One of the best iPhone at this price.No problem. No heating or bezel issue for a Norma user.Display is very fine and crisp. Not like normal lcd screen. Far more greater quality then other phones which show more resolution in numbers.Sound quality is great.And Apple customer care assistance is what makes them unique.

"
"

  Amazon and appario retail did a good job.I received a apple factory sealed package.But I found that the front glass was scratched mildly, running throughout the glass... That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service.Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera. But Major difference is 5G and design.

"
"

  There is no android phone in the market which could compete this beast. Undoubtedly best for Pubg if you taking this for game or youtubing go for it......if not i think you should switch to oneplus varient.....best thing about this phone is its privacy and gaming screen recorder its just unbelievable.....only cons (charging process is very slowwwwwww it takes 3hrs for 5w charger, 2hrs for 12w charger and 1.5hrs for 18w charger) NO FAST CHARGING the only reason for 4 starüòâüòâüòâ

"
"

  Phone is premium feels good in hand sound quality is good camera are okay you can record 4 k price is high go for one plus 8 t I use one plus 7t and there is a a little difference between both iphone 11 and OnePlus 7t 258 gb where as my iphone is 128 gb price difference 13 thousand

"
"

  Software is not working properlyReceived faulty item, Amazon is selling second hand or second copy of the iPhone 11 phoneSuggest people don't go for online shopping from Amazon.. they are attracting you in the name of discount but selling old and used phones

"
"

  ordered this product on amazon big billion day sale. the product packaging was very good and the product is 100 percent genuine as one can see on apple id when the product got registered and got full 1 year warranty. the phone is very fst and the software experience is very fluid. got this phoneat rs 44k. the best deal i can get on iphone. one looking to purchase iphone can surely put money on this. tough at this price factor one can get android with much more features. but if u want a unique experience then apple is the way to go

"
"

  The product I received is best... everything is working fine .. but I don't know why Amazon doing fake marketing why are they saying earpods though they are providing ear phones. It's illogical to provide earphones with iphone 11 because it's doesn't support earphones.

"
"

  Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performanceThe only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively.If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money optionDisplay is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros.

"
"

  Awesome body and look. Weight is little heavy. No 5g support,No finger print sensor, no fast charger,no case inside box, best new was e sim support we can use as secondary sim I.e dual sim support in others words if we say, battery life is ok, over all 4 out of 5. Best experience I would have given 5 out of 5, if it supports 5g.

"
"

  1. Camera is great2. Display quality is below average for watching content. Youtube, facebook and instagram videos look blurry all the time. If u  r coming from nokia 1100 only then u may like this display.3. Gaming performance is awesome.4. It has one day battery. Does not matter how intense user you are.5. Camera quality is also great.In simple words this smartphone is good for content creation becoz of its camera but worst for content watching on social media. Mark my words. Poor display.

"
"

  I am writing this review after using it for a month.Performance is excellent and the camera too.Little disappointed with slow charging as it comes only with 5 wt adapterBut now i am facing bottom speaker problem and its a very big problem for me as it stopped working and at this price point this should not have happened as from my point of view.

"
"

  üì±  are best always, its expensive but total worth it once you use , camera, speed, screen, and many more just like human applications which gives you amazing experience in daily use... special phone speakers üîä are terrific, üòÉüëç...

"
"

  Great product (which was indeed expected) as Apple always delivers the best.Switched from iPhone 6 and this has been the perfect switch.. Great battery life with such faster face recognition. And you won‚Äôt find a better camera in the market than this (specially the night mode)But thanks to Amazon for delivering the product without any issues. I‚Äôm saying this because I ordered the phone at 10pm and it was delivered the next day at 9:30am which was completely unexpected in these lockdown days.

"
"

  I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this phone, this is my first ever iPhone and everything about it is amazing, the battery lasts me all day even with heavy usage. The camera quality is superb!If it fits in your budget and then go for it without even a second thought! Loveeee it ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Purchased this during amazon great Indian festival sale, costed me around 45500I was little sceptical about smartphone online but amazon is trustworthy so i placed my order.It was a steal deal for me!Loved it! It was delivered in 2 days

"
"

  Mobile is superBut I will book on date 06/08/2020I will  Received mobile 19/08/2020My Account Amzon prime

"
"

  Using my device for last 20 days and it‚Äôs been a great experience. I switched from Android to iOS and it seems to be a good decision now. Battery, Camera and Performance all are excellent. Display is not so great when compared Oled display in 11pro but still it is better than many Android phones available in market. Face recognition is superfast in any light condition. Only thing that irritates here is 5W slow charger but it keeps your battery health better anyways in hurry situations I‚Äôve to use 12W charger(bought separately). At the end I‚Äôm super happy with my phone.

"
"

  Its been a month i am using this phone i.e the iphone 11 which i ordered from amazon and got the delivery by 14th of july. Since then, i have never faced any issue regarding this piece. Except the charger issue it must have been a rapid charger instead of this 5 watt charger its still ok it takes 4-5 hours to charge completely.

"
"

  Its obvious how amazing this product is otherwise you wouldn't be here reading this review. I would like to shed some light on how amazing Amazon is. I got the product 24 hours in advance in perfect condition during heavy monsoon season. Amazon really surprised me and did an amazing job! No issues with the product. Kindly read all return and refund policies before ordering. Amazon is really transparent and all the information you need is in this page. So read intently and hopefully you won't have any further questions. Just add to cart and don't think too much!

"
"

  Well the phone is very good.The colour i expected is far more better than my expectation.But i have faced a problem with the adapter. That is,it stop working after 2 weeks.I don‚Äôt know the problem behind it.It suddenly stops working and so i have to buy another charger again.Without that the phone is awesome.Good system,good camera as expected from apple.Overall good phone and i recommend to people who are huge fan of apple brand.

"
"

  ¬†I was using iPhone 6s and I needed a upgrade so I decided to buy iPhone11 and its really awesome phone with the fastest face unlockSound quality is way too much better than the other iPhonesCamera is the best and it is way ahead of all the smartphones except iPhone 11 Pro and pro maxIf you are thinking of getting one , go for it you won‚Äôt regret it ü§©ü§©Apple products are always better than any otherI have added a sample video shot from this phoneDo have a look at it

"
"

  Battery is defectiveAfter charging 100per the battery percentage drops into zero(0)From nowdays I will never trust Amazon .....It's not a single penny it's about 48kFor common person it's huge amountAnd no one will not accept such defective items.Meanwhile I tried to return but AmazonDirectly said talk to appleIs that fair ?@AMAZONI can say loudly that Flipkart is far better than Amazon I know theirs item price is high but atleast they care after being delivered

"
"

  This is phone is amazing!Face ID : responsive and super save!!Camera: It‚Äôs the best feature of this phone! Really good camera.Display: it‚Äôs still good! When compared to a one plus 7 and 8. It‚Äôs just brighter but it‚Äôs not sharperIf you want the best display in the game go for 11 pro.I have no complaints on this

"
"

  The iPhone 11 delivers the charm of an iPhone. Right from the face recognition, battery life....the performance is top notch..Bought it for 62K and value for money.The above photo was taken in night mode only with the light from a covered oil lamp

"
"

  My second iPhone. Got at a decent price. This is literally a premium product.Pros: Best front camera.6.1‚ÄùLiquid retina display.A13 bionic chip.Cons: picture quality drops while using wide angle camera.glass back has high chance for breakage if droppedPS: Don‚Äôt go for this product by attraction! can get any iphone at budget level for daily normal usage unless you are rich! best for productivity and high performance viz. Video editing, High end Games etc.

"
"

  we can't save song in iphone like a android phone.

"
"

  Got a July 2020 make, assembled in China, 128gb black variant with accessories and phone box including outer seal intact. Overall happy with the purchase. I am giving a 4 star because of the packaging. The box piece was delivered within a loose amazon packet which could easily damage the product while in transit. Appario should really put an eye on shipping and handling as we are paying a fair amount for the phone.Other than that everything looks good.

"
"

  The retailer  is duping people. I got a dead product which is having motherboard issue. It doesn't switch on, just a dummy. The IMEI in the bill doesn't match with the device. Even the apple care representatives are avoiding us to buy from amazon specially during festive season.Basically the retailers are mixing the dead products  and other products so there is 50-50 chance you might get a dead product.

"
"

  All good but it's a little heavy and thick as Compares to other models. Others are moving to thinner and slicker models dont know why apple going the opposite way. Performance battery and camera all working as expected

"
"

  Again after android usage I am back to iPhoneEarlier I was using iPhone 4, 5 and 6 Series for a change I was using android. Now I am back to iPhone (Specially iOS) due to the Performance.As I know Apple‚Äôs Performance - No one can do thisAmazon delivery as expected one day before delivered thanks

"
"

  Too new to rate. Some of the recent reviews were extremely scary for an Apple product and unfortunate that those customers were given bad products. Took a risk, ordered and told to cancel but Amazon force delivered the product. Opened and checked for defects, none so far.  Made in India, product is authentic! Thankfully not a refurbished phone. Verified the warranty, started using, so far so good. Will try update review periodically for your benefit.

"
"

  It is my 2nd IPhone after iPhone 7.The best thing that I have liked is the camera.Battery life is not that much great .Face recognition is super fast.Overall it‚Äôs a must buy iPhone if you want to upgrade from any IPhone  predecessor.Apple could have given a better FHD display.

"
"

  Do not ,I repeat do not buy iPhone from this retailer. My phone stopped turning on after 2 weeks of purchase . After giving it to the service center it had to be sent to Bangalore where it was replaced and sent back to me again. But I was without my phone for almost a month. My phone is working fine now but all in all it was such a hassle. Never buy an apple product from this  retailer called appario retail pvt ltd.Best to buy it from the store.

"
"

  lots of bugs in this mobile .. networks goes while calling , internet not works most of time .. face id is not as good as it should be .. and as i said about network issues , it is only with this hand set .. as one of my friend purchased same phone and he is also facing same issues ..

"
"

  I want to return mobile which is ordered on 21st july 2020 and delivered on 26th July, because battery life drains quickly, while charging mobile was heating, didn‚Äôt have external memory card, app like true caller were not responding properly, mobile is locked with my own Face ID even it is unlocking with my brother‚Äôs face.

"
"

  Only one word for this phone - it's a beast. Battery life is really good. I charge it once in 2 days with minimal usage (4-5 hours with personal hotspot on). Display is really good even if it is an LCD display. Go for it without having a doubt. My device is currently on IOS 13.6.1. I would recommend you to watch few YouTube videos about bad battery life on IOS 14 and then upgrade your device. Cheers

"
"

  Guys stop buying products from here.  There is definitely some old stock sellings in the name of OFFER. I do not play games. Only YouTube amazon prime FB WA and calling. Charge my device once in 20-24hrs.  Still just in 34 days my battery health dropped by 2 %. Pls buy from genuine store.

"
"

  Pros:Battery (lasts for a day with medium to high usage)Wireless chargingBest IPS LCDValue for money.Camera is brilliant. Low light photos turn out to be amazing.Cons:Could have provided OLED display.

"
"

  Best battery life.I have upgraded from iPhone 6 to 11.Major performance difference no hang at all.Major difference in battery life too as it drains very slow the device will hold for maximum two days.No heating issuesCamera best

"
"

  I shift from android to iOS first time. This product is my first iOS device. This is very amazing and superb device. I received made in India device. I order on amazon, Quick delivery service and genuine product provide by amazon thanks amazon.1. Camera Quality superb2. iOS 13.7 with excellent features3. Battery life is good in comparison of old iPhone model.4. Solid build quality5. Esim working smoothly(I use with two sim)

"
"

  Worst ever! Battery health starts to drop within 3 months of usage. Camera for pictures suck when compared to OnePlus or other android phones. Phone gets heated up within 10-15 minutes of talking over calls or internet use. Apple customer care doesn‚Äôt do anything but say this is best IPhone ever and everything is good with it.Also, I bought on EMI for 6 months with HDFC credit card with a 5000rs discount but i have to pay the EMI for the full amount gets cut every month.

"
"

  Phone is a must buy but the 128 gigs.Display is fab. Even though it‚Äôs a LCD. The only down side is that it‚Äôs not so bright as an AMOLED.Camera wise it has the best lens. Even the front facing cam provides a wide angle.Upgraded from an iPhone 8 definitely worth the upgrade.Don‚Äôt worry about gaming everything is playable in ultra settings.

"
"

  This is best phone of the year..Some people spared fake newsThe appario retails private limited.. company... They sold this phone.. phone is genuine and original... Go for it.. all negative review are only they order refabrished phone.. not new phone.. they do not chek any headline and they ordered these phone.. Please chek it and order it it's orginal product

"
"

  Phone is quite good. Changed to iphone from oneplus 7. This phone is really nice but I find androids are way more easy to handle and operate. Cameras are best on this device. Audio is good and screen quality is really decent.

"
"

  Android user previously, so if you wanna update to iOS just go for this one.Pros--Cameras are just the best-Display is LCD but you‚Äôll not feel that it‚Äôs  that good-The haptics give a premium experience overallCons-Battery life could be slightly better

"
"

  Worst purchase for such huge amount that was spent. Camera quality is very poor, my galaxy s9 plus is much better than this one. Amazon doesn‚Äôt accept return but the options in the app shows return applicable. iPhone claims to have best camera and has large hoardings everywhere but in reality it‚Äôs not.Totally regret on this purchase.

"
"

  Got it on Amazon Oct Sale, including hdfc card discount 64GB model price was Rs 46249 which is good deal if you don‚Äôt require AirPods. Initially had trouble with phone not recognising Jio sim but it worked after few retries. 2 days usage review and all works well so far.

"
"

  I upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone 11 and I am loving the new phone. It's very fast, has a great camera, and is extremely easy to use. The battery life is brilliant! The only thing that could have been better is the face recognition feature. Sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the face and you will need to unlock the phone through some other way. Otherwise, it is an amazing phone!

"
"

  Received iPhone 11 on monday. It showed a cosmetic patch( Oval patch) on the lower left corner of the phone on Tuesday morning. Took the phone to iCare centre on wednesday and they confirmed its a faulty product. Contacted Apple Customer Support, they asked to take the issue with Amazon and seller and get it replaced as the device is faulty. I have the service report and images which shows the condition of the display.

"
"

  iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.

  Everythin about phn is so good.Only thing that i did not like is the adapter given for charging..It is of 5W only and it take almost 2.5 to 3 hra to charge your phn to 100%.When. You are spending so much amount then we should expect from apple to provide with compatible charger as they are giving in pro and max pro..

  Mobile battery getting drain so fast and it's also getting heat

  After Reading so much negative reviews on internet for Appario sell pvt ltd i am afraidBut when I receive the phone everything is fine packaging was genuine and good all stuff goodBest part is I received  assembled in India variant‚ù§Ô∏èPhone is blazing fastCamera beastBattery backup very goodOnly.  Bad thing is its  5 watt chargerIt take 3 hours to full charge.. Buy in 46749‚Çπ only ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èMy second iphone

"
"

  The phone is awesome. The face recognition system is super fast, camera quality is also amazing. I am just disappointed a bit with charging speed . Otherwise the phone is amazing.

"
"

  Freaking pathetic when the phone was a defective piece and wanted to replace/refund.. they say contact the apple brand and when I go to them they say they don't have any connection since it was bought from Amazon and when I contacted the Amazon someone names ( TANMAYA) was in touch as customer service agent was trying to toss me around here and there ...and when I ask for a denial letter that Amazon and they claim they aren't responsible for this..

"
"

  ¬†superb colour.. awesome look... smooth performance...

"
"

  My reviews are based on switching from Android to Apple:Cons:1. Switching is too difficult, it took hell lot of time to fully recover data (Move to IOS app was used)2. Not All data got copied3.Apple Customer Service was not great4. Samsung S10 is sleek, having 3 cameras, bigger battery.5. This is heavier & thicker than Samsung S106. No fast charging

"
"

  i had applied for replacement of the same but no response for the same even though it was abt to be replaced on july 21. Now repacement window is also closed. No contact details also to complain

"
"

  This is by far the next excellent iPhone after 6s. I have users 6s for 4 years. And it‚Äôs still working fine.From 5c to 6s to 11 ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a great joyiPhone 11 is big revolutionary product which has a lot of hardware. Don‚Äôt worry about the money, it‚Äôs with every rupees.

"
"

  Worth for each penny ( Thanks to Apple )Battery superCamera ultimateLook wise stylishPerformance goodOver all Excellent

"
"

  I recieved my order in 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for the swift delivery. I have been using apple for almost 3 years and trust me if you are upgrading from a old iphone then iphone 11 is the best option to go. The camera is the best and the sound quality is super excellent. I am sure that you will fall for the red colour one, maybe thats my preference.

"
"

  First time experiencing exchange offer.  It worked very well than expected. The instructions sent by Amazon was great helpful. Product also is very good and it is my first iPhone!!

"
"

  Back to basics I moved from android to iPhone after 5 years and no regrets. Absolutely awesome piece of tech from hardware to software all the small details are kept in mind and handled well. Only thing I miss is fast charger that‚Äôs it

"
"

  I have bought an iPhone for the very first time. The experience is so good. This one is an 128gb variant. If you wanna hesitation free longtime use of the product you should go with the 128 gb variant. The sound quality of this one has the power to rich you in heaven. Actually can‚Äôt express the inner feelings about how smooth as well as good it is.

"
"

  Needless to say. Very happy with the phone. Using it for a week now. In love with it. Highly recommend.

"
"

  Superb and very powerful phone. Great battery ,superb camera, and audio ofcourse with Dolby Atmos. Feel free to buy if your budget is around 70k.. delivery was fast .actually came faster than the expected date.

"
"

  Loved everything about this phone. For someone who is really up for a big upgrade and want a seamlessly smooth experience, you can go for it. It's totally worth it. Battery capacity is quite good. I think the greatest con will include slow charger, ohterwise all in all a great experience.

"
"

  Amazon is useless .gave me a unsealed iPhone which doesnt work . Strictly not recommending Amazon

"
"

  Over all happy with the product but the phone sometimes get heated to 40 degrees thats the only issue this model of apple phone have

"
"

  I‚Äôm not able to switch on the personal hotspot , it show approach carrier , I approached to network carrier they said everything is fine from their side . I need immediate response in this

"
"

  As always iphone is the best, but you have to keep in mind that it's worth 60k , I wouldn't recommend spending any further! Oh And if you want Indian units then you will have to go for either black or white varient! Because I got the green one & it's assembled in Chaina!

"
"

  iPhone 11 comes with an elegant look and with a great performance. Its Face recognition technology works perfectly and battery performance  is amazing. Amazon has delivered this in one day!!! Thanks to Amazon. Loved this phone very much.

"
"

  The battery life is just awesomeDoesn‚Äôt have heating issues on overusing.  What I really suggest is to update as soon as you are done with configuring phone.Charger takes way too long to charge but 100% battery can go upto 12hrs of extensive use.

"
"

  I received used I phone and no accessories Iphone already Installed glass i am see after shocked and trying to start i phone but Iphone not started after i go near shop after I phone start i am shocked so much no accessories it‚Äôs ok but why send used I phone.

"
"

  ¬†Mind blowing experience both by Amazon and Apple iphone 11

"
"

  Received in good condition and it is working great with a great camera.Only a bit less battery backup I think sometimes.Good looks, quick processing, face id is greatOverall it was a great online purchase experience for usThanks amazon

"
"

  Iphone 11 disappointed with charger...I decided to buy 12w original apple charger..Go for it....smooth experienceDon't fall under negative commentsI got it for 59990 in prime dayAs for this price..it's value for money phone

"
"

  Received damaged phone paint off on the edges of camera...Need help to get it sorted...

"
"

  The phone is pure class and performance. Have been using it for a month now and I am pretty satisfied. The camera is excellent, battery life lasts a day easily with average usage. The screen works just fine and there‚Äôs no complaints whatsoever. The looks are amazing. The face recognition works great and it‚Äôs very secure and accurate. Overall, a great buy

"
"

  Very nice phone.must buy it in this price range. Very good quality of camera, long battery life, nice lcd display, face recognition is very very much fast. Only one heating problem will be there but it‚Äôs common for all apple brands phone if you use continuously than phone become hot but its also depands on the weather temperature. I suggest you to buy iphone 11 without any problem.

"
"

  I used the phone for one n half month suddenly today it got hanged n after few minutes later it was showing complete black screenI asked apple but they said need to go to store as device is dead during Covid -19 and they can't detect the reason.When I asked Amazon they asked to contact dealer.. it's going round n round in a loopNo one here trying to help

"
"

  Just brilliant at literally everything.Camera is truly flagship.For my usage, it lasts at least 1¬π/2 day as it's battery life management is tremendous.And the Apple Logo üòâ

"
"

  I am a hard core android device user...But this is unmatchable device. I am expecting more and more from Apple. Truly a joy using everyday. Expensive at top class performance.Cons: Charge is very slow. Could have provided fast charger. For me doesn‚Äôt matter to spend a little more but I expect everything in single box.

"
"

  Awesome packaging and looks good.. best part is it is manufactured in India.. Face id and Battery life looks good.. must buy!

"
"

  I am Glad and Lucky that I Switched from Android to IOS that too On Best Selling Phone In World Iphone 11...What an Amazing Feeling It is, Iphone 11 is A Beast With Best Battery Backup and Screen on Time .I suggest It As One of the Best Smartphone

"
"

  got it for rs 59900 on prime day !! In love with the cameras altogether let the droids talk iphone will be iphone !!!(Life is not hard without one kidney)

"
"

  Over all good phone,  i can play pubg for 3 and a half hour with low setting with full charged to 10 %‚Ä¢ Camera is good,  but charger is very slow,  its take more than 3 hour to full chareged from 0 to 100 %.

"
"

  Awesome phone, solid build, battery last more than expected, camera quality is outstandingBut it take lot of money and feels heavy in hand, so sometime it‚Äôs annoying (as I upgraded from iphone 6)

"
"

  iPhone has become like xiaomi prices are falling so much I bought it for 73600 and now 54000 what the *****Camera is perfect but battery life NO NO NO . I have been using iPhone since 2017 and I really like how it works but battery is always disappointing . In a month my battery health is 99%

"
"

  I am very new to apple environment. If you are swithcing from android to apple then user will love all the features.Camera is upto my expectation.Battery life is okiesh.But the charger which is part of accessories is not of good quality. Very disappointed with the charger

"
"

  after watching so many bad reviews i was worried about the mobile it is fake or real?so many videos out on youtube also...but to be frank i received a very good and quality product its original not fake..i checked my i phone on apple site also by puttiing my serial number of mobile its verified by apple...received with charger ,cable and wired headphones...Very happy to buy this ..Thanx Amazon.

"
"

  I've been cheated for ‚Çπ60000/- for this product by Amazon by sending me a handset which had manufacturing fault. The fault was well pointed out by Apple's authorised service center. While contacting customer service on numerous occasions they made to wait for more tha  a month and after a month they said 'sorry sir, we can't help you'. Handset is useles lying in my cupboard.

"
"

  Everything was perfectly amazing from the delivery of the product in a secure package to the fast delivery and proper packaging.About the product it doesn‚Äôt seems right to comment on that as it‚Äôs an iPhone and you all might be aware of that. But I would like to assure you just one thing that the product is genuine.

"
"

  Excluding the negetives( no Amoled , no 1080p display and thick border) is the best phone in price point.Awesome speedAwesome cameraAwesome fluidic gesturesAwesome battery  backupSplendid facial recognitionGo for it. You Will not regret a bit

"
"

  It‚Äôs an amazing phone. Indeed the Best Buy ever you can expect.Considering an android user, you will be much more happy being an iOS user üòÉ

"
"

  5 star for AmazonFor Apple it‚Äôs a good upgradeCamera is goodBattery not that greatHandyAnd yes charger quality is very bad you need to purchase a new one very soon

"
"

  Got this at Great Indian Festival, top class phone with ios14 update already, great camera, performance lag free , battery life way good than even android phones with 5000mah batteries .

"
"

  I don‚Äôt know why this costlier phone doesn‚Äôt have finger print, and he Face ID is not so secure it will recognise your face even when you close you eyes thats big drawback. Like in one plus it will not unlock phone when you are sleeping it needs open eyes, but not in iPhone ,this costlier phone must have high security.iPhone needs to fix this in next update.

"
"

  Well it's an iPhone and I am not a tech reviewer. For that checkout MKBHD. The phone charges pathetically slow... I might have to pick up a quick charger separately.

"
"

  ¬†The phone delivered to me was in perfect mint condition and no problem with the delivery or service. Authentic product at affordable price ‚ù§

"
"

  product is nice but in case of money u have to get super amoled screen and bluetooth earphone and 5w charger is disgusting shame on u apple

"
"

  I love the service but just scared a bit, the phone is have some issues and couldn‚Äôt figure out that is it the phone or the app that caused the minor issue.Taking too long to charge that is one negative point. But battery back up is really great.Sometimes observer connection issue with Boss sound sport and never had those issue when used with I phone 7.

"
"

  After reading all the negative feedbacks on Appario retail and that too after placing the orders, I was very scared of receving defective or used iphone but after getting both the phones I can say both the phones are new and fantastic. I am really happy & satisfied with the phones.

"
"

  Too much heating on normal operations. Too bad Quality...it's a zero review note it down.

"
"

  Mobile is getting heated in 5 mins of usage...I asked for replacement to amazon they ate telling to go to service center...they told that it is normal heat

"
"

  After 2 day of use i found worth it Camera quality is very good before buying I‚Äôm bit worried by reading reviews about heating issue and hanging issue, at first time charge phone bit heated but manageable after that no heat issue as such I haven‚Äôt played game coz not a fan of games and all. Battery backup is also decent. Only drawback i see is that at this huge price only 5w slow charger is provided

"
"

  You Have supplied defective product and now as per your policy there is no replacement, Now I need to talk to Apple customer care why ? if i used the phone for some time than it get faulty than i understand ,Very bad experience and last 24 hr trying to reach customer care but not able to get the any agent on call.. kindly replace this item immediately to further escalation...

"
"

  Genuine Product Received, was in doubt after reading comments about seller. I bought iPhone 11 128gb in Amazon Great Indian Sale without phone exchange with HDFC card @51500/- Thanks.

"
"

  Received my phone 2 days before delivery...i was worried after reading some reviews..but original phone ,everything as mentioned in the box....will tell after month how things are .hope for the best

"
"

  The best in class. There is a feel good factor about this phone. Almost perfect for a regular guy. Battery life first class though need to follow some battery saving tips. Camera one of the best awesome clarity and i am in love with studio light pictures. Nice clean os with now having some new gestures.face recognition almost worked 95% for me.loved it. If anyone has any doubts or need any clarity comment here i will be happy to help.

"
"

  Sometimes a minor fault is coming in settings it may be due to the app we installed or the network but I‚Äôm not sure about anything. Rest all are good but expensive.

"
"

  Today finally I got my iPhone 11, but it doesn't go well as expected, the ringtone volume goes off as it rings, not audible and even while on phone(on conversation) it needs Loudspeaker on to make the sound audible. I am going to return this iPhone to the Amazon and i suggest you friend don't buy this phone as most of iphones have some or less problems.

  Best product and value for money

  Very gud camera quality and battery life is very gud.  White color is very  Attractive  Persnly i love it

"
"

  Switched from iPhone 7.. Trust me with this price range this is best offering from Apple.Camera: 5/5Processor: 5/5Battery: 4/5Screen:4/5Best thing about iPhone is that you keep getting updates even after 3-4  years, which is still a worry for some flagship Android phone.

"
"

  After seeing the deal without any second thoughts I ordered iPhone 11. But after reading all those negative comments I was shattered!Literally I was praying and tensed that I should receive a good phone, lol at least a phone!Yes I totally received a brand new phone. Just using it for a day so far no heating, audio and camera issues.

"
"

  Purchased in December.Decent phone with good battery backup as per apple standard.Camera is big upgrade from previous generation.iOS 13 can cause some hiccups but certainly a buy for apple lovers.For Apple haters : camera is quite good compared to pixel 2 and one plus previous generation.

"
"

  Thanks to Amazon I got it at very cheap price and plus I got discount for my credit card I am very much satisfied for what I paid for this iPhone.

"
"

  Ordered this phone in the midnight and very same day early morning phone was in my handThis is how Amazon deliverersI just can say i have been a loyal customer of amazon u have proved time n againThank you for such a wonderful phone at Irresistible price and super duper fast delivery

"
"

  Actually read many bad reviews about the seller and product and researched many sites and purchased the product with half-heart.But the product is good as purchased in apple Store.No issues, actually we need to update the OS once received . once updates there is no issue as mentioned in the bad reviews . you can absolutely go on this product

"
"

  Having used iPhone already was not much excited when I ordered this. But when I got it in hand and started using it it was a pleasant surprise. A great package of software inside a great phone. Apple did it once again.

"
"

  All the right things with right amount. Camera is typical apple, impressive battery life. Feel big in hand, aluminium sides feel slippery. Smoothness is charm, powerful A13 bionic does not let you down with multitasking. Only disappointment is same 5W brick, apple should atleast give 16W charger in box.

"
"

  Though the reviews were bad of seller.. was little bit afraid..But recieved a brand new iphone 11 at 46750‚Çπ.The color is so fresh,calm and composed.Looks very affluent onc u hold it in ur hand.Camera quality is just fab.If you hav good budgetDen plz go for dis phone.

"
"

  The most valuable product üëå and any one want to move from android to iOS it is a great initial for you and you have to get great experience for your this productüòÅ

  I was waiting to buy this phone from lunch but all the time out of stock know I got the phone from Amazon thankful to Amazon this phone gift to me from my family before my birthday I always like apple phone from day one I recommend to buy this phone value for money good battery good camera thank you

"
"

  After a month use,I can say that it is one of the Best phone in the market.U will little trouble when u move from Android to iOS since it do not give u freedom to download online video.Thiugh by some App u can do soCamera quality is Superb,only issue is SloMo video gets blurred in room light. Use DoDax App to download Youtube video.

"
"

  Initially, I was very skeptical to order the phone in this great Indian festival especially when the apple store was offering at a higher price but I am so happy relieved and thankful to Amazon. The phone came out great. No problems faced. Thank you Amazon for maintaing the trust we have on you.

"
"

  Had to request for headphone replacement in Pune location, which again going to take 10 days for replacement.The first one with box should have been tested correctly as saw that it stopped working in just 20 days of use.Mobile as such is not bad, but thats expected considering Apple

"
"

  Super fast delivery. Item delivered on very next day as promised. Phone recieved in sealed package and working fine for last two days. Didn't get much time to explore, however build quality and look of the phone is fabulous. Can't tell about the camera quality and other technical details as I have not used the phone much post delivery.

"
"

  The Apple iPhone 11 that I received today had already been opened. I got it without any deal or plastic cover.I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs damaged inside I am not touching itPlease take it back and give me a completely new packed one.I am extremely upset about this.

"
"

  Better go with iPhone 11 pro or buy X RNothing different in between XR and 11

"
"

  I‚Äôm very impressed with iPhone 11. It‚Äôs battery life is so awesome and camera quality is dope. Let‚Äôs talk about Face recognition it has the fastest Face ID recognition I have ever seen and it has the fastest chip A13 Bionic inside so don‚Äôt worry about performance. I‚Äôm 100% satisfy with the product.

"
"

  Brilliant design and good responsive phone. I bought this for my father and he is thoroughly enjoying using it. Amazon delivery was quick and product arrived in a perfect condition. Obviously the battery life in Apple phoneS has been just above average and that continues for iPhone 11 too. Otherwise it is a great product especially for senior citizens.

"
"

  Worst mistake of my life. I have brought this product for my feyonce and my trouble started from that day onwards. Mobile display was faulty and when i reached apple store they kept the iphone for 1 week and replaced the display. After 1 day same issue happened again still the same cycle. Its 3rd time that same issue is coming.

"
"

  its not working. i requested to amazon to replace the product on 14th-aug. but till date i not received any response. kindly solve the issue

"
"

  Just recieved my purple colour iphone11, a good upgrade from iphone 6s to 11. So far the delivery was good and it was well packed with all items intact. Well while buying I did read a few negative comments luckily I didn't face any.If any one is worrying that the battery might heat up mine didn't.

"
"

  Today i got my iphone 11-64gb.firstly i m very thankful to Amazon bcz i m getting my product within 2 days.the product is genuine so i m very happy..This sale is really very helpful bcz i m getting my product at very low price..So my request to all don‚Äôt be hesitate and afraid to buy iphone on Amazon..

"
"

  It takes 4hours to charge and 5-6hours running time. Present time nobody can wait 4hours just to charge a phone on airplane mode otherwise bot phone and charger can overheat. Not so satisfying charger and battery. So many brands are far ahead in the same price. Color is light lemony instead of yellow.

"
"

  Very happy with the sturdyness of the product. yes it adds bulk but knew it. Safety of the phone was most important for someone like me who tends to rough handle phones, so happy with it.

"
"

  First time I phone 11 very bad experience dont purchase on amazon my phn having issue with speaker and then call to amzon support he is taking to me no responsiblity of amzon in case of apple product contact with apple support worst experience

"
"

  It‚Äôs is not a phone...it is an IPHONE...a beauty,,,class apart...If you can spend such an amount than don‚Äôt waste on any other brand...because your money deserves IPhOne 11.

"
"

  Apple has done a great job on  this phone. If you want to upgrade or planning for apple phone. Then buy it. Worth the value.

"
"

  Switched from android to ios, everythng is working good except  camera selfie shooter. While taking close up selfies one side of face appears like swollen or like distorted shaped. If anyone have idea that how to fix that...please do reply

"
"

  Camera was not working properly there was a lot of noise in indoor photos .The seller here appario rtl LTD is having issues with the phone I don't whether they are selling authentic phones .I got it replaced ,but the replacement unit also had same problem ,so just got it refunded. Think 1000 times before buying from Appario LTD seller.

"
"

  Awesome Camera & Improved Siri...Just enjoyDid not like charger provided with the product too less powerful to charge battery.. very slow charging capacity, however mobile last long once fully charged...sufficient for mobile extensive users except gamer.

"
"

  Excellent product with great features which are key differentiators compared to others:- Best design and weight- Best camera on low light- Best display and graphics- Best Batery usagesExpensive became affordable, Thanks to iPhone 12 and Amazon offers.

"
"

  If you're an Apple fan, what are your waiting for? Right moment and the best price for iPhone 11. Save that beloved kidney and buy this terrific phone now.

"
"

  Please check the phone .. when I call some one from this phone after talking, I click on my phone screen to cut the call but despite that the screen keep showing black then I press the switch off button from the side even it the screen remain black and the after while this is ok.. please change my product otherwise confirm my query

"
"

  Need not say much about the product as it‚Äôs universally known. However one must try from Amazon during offers. Genuine product... thanks Amazon

"
"

  The day when I received the iphone11 it's hearing speaker is not working while receiving call and while calling someone it's making some beeping sound I contact with customer care but there was no response so pls don't buy things from amazon they are selling duplicate products to customers so pls don't waste ur savings with Amazon

"
"

  No one cares about the review on an iPhone unless you are an android fanboi.Well, the battery backup of this phone is quite good also the camera quality is amazing.

"
"

  I have recived a defective product it‚Äôs spekar is not working properly and the mrp is on product is 64900 and price taken by me is 68300

"
"

  No seal, ni invoice and it was not original packing as mobile was over the panphlets.. so clearly mobile was used/ open and not originally given

"
"

  Product delivery time was bit disappointing. However the product is genuine and Happy with overall service. iPhone 11 really feels very premium  and smooth. Used to wonder why it‚Äôs so costly, but when I started using it, I came to a conclusion that it‚Äôs really worth the money.But not sure about the service. Hoping for the best.

  Back camera stopped working after 10 days.

"
"

  Screen is not scratch proof as Apple shows in the add. Pls put acreen guard on it. My phone has few scratches with in 2 months, rest all other features are great.

"
"

  Just go for it.Display is just amazing, I honestly didn't find any difference between an OLED and iPhone 11's retina display. People upgrading from 6or 7or 8 will find this as a pretty decent deal.

"
"

  ¬†Really disappointed. This purchase has saddened me so much. This was my first iPhone purchase ever, I was so happy but when I unboxed the product, I saw a gap between the frame and back glass, this may be a refurbished product. I will not purchase costly products again from Amazon.

"
"

  Camera is good,battery life is almost 2-3 days,display is awesome, and offcrse it‚Äôs iPhone üòâ

"
"

  For the price it doesn‚Äôt  have much to offer.. if you are already having a Iphone then it won‚Äôt feel any different.. but yeah wide angle camera is cool..

"
"

  Received delivery by Amazon with 18 hours and amazing experience..

"
"

  Good phone. Battery charging is slow with provided charger. More over donor support 18 W charger. Screen time for full charge is. It more than 9-9.5 hrs.

"
"

  Greatttt deal!!! thanks alottt Amazon for the offer and one day delivery, really awesome!!!Camera superbDesign  AwesomeBattery full day battery, charging time is around 2hrsFeel the Performance of the phone to a whole new level A13 is far better than 865 processor.Must go for it!!!

"
"

  The phone is just brilliant. It‚Äôs lighter than the XR for sure. At least that‚Äôs how I felt it. Camera is brilliant, sound is amazing and the battery is strong. Love it. Will hold on to this for a long time now. I am happy to be associating myself with Apple. Their products might be expensive but they are long stay products. Thanks, Apple.

"
"

  Got it in 10 days during the pandemic semi-unlock days. Back looks great, front is fairly nice too. Apple makes premium products. Just that the weight and breadth of the phone is a bit old age now, shifting from a slim-trim oneplus5t to this, you'll have to have a tighter grip . Nevertheless, Photos are amazingly beautiful. Great buy.

"
"

  Since ppl will have doubt on its battery performanceI must say it has the best battery in any iPhone ever. No less than any android phone‚Äôs battery. It‚Äôs amazing

"
"

  Got new phone today and noticed a black patch 8n the initial setup screen.it can be due to the wallpaper in the background....Awaiting apple support. And I noticed some else posted the same in the review. So is it a real issue or is this how it will appear?

"
"

  After using almost 4 days I feel I phone 11 performance wise is amazing no lags at all sound is good, Camera taking good photos the only concern what I feel is display at this price range should have given oled display rather than LCD display and Thanks to Amazon for delivering it very fast.

"
"

  The speaker are giving a broken sound after buying a phone worth 60000 if the speakers are damaged whats the use of my buying an Iphone and being a prime customer

"
"

  Looks premium. Feels solid. Two cons noticed - First - Very bulky and heavy. Second - LCD screen is a let down.Overall, a good package.

"
"

  Thank you Amazon. white I phone 11 however the camera quality and battery could be better. also a finger print scanner is missing.

"
"

  Camara quality is no that great videos is so good but picture quality is not that great if you're look for taking photos go for another option,looking for Videographi then go for it,don't bodered about the build quality its awesome gaming also so good battery backup also no bad you can use it for a hole day.....

"
"

  Switched from oneplus one to iphone 11 (1+1 = 11)so basically 1st time ios user.user interface is direct and simple to use. it‚Äôs not gimmicky it‚Äôs just straight to the point.Camera is excellentbatterlife is fine18 watt charger should be provided instead of 5 wattcomfortable screen no issuesoverall nice package by apple

"

  Have been using iPhone since iPhone 5 and this one by far is the best.Great picture quality, superfast processing, brilliant display, great sound and lot more.

  optimized battery in iphone 11. i had fully charged my phone and wasn't using it for nearly 3 hours (no calls but few meaasges were received) and yet there was no dip in battery percentage. later had a long call on speaker with screen ON for 2 hours and battery just drained of 18 percentage which is far better.

"
"

"
"

  Lcd display and internet connectivity compared to similar priced android phones is very low. As you all know 30k for phone and 40k for brand name.

"
"

  Excellent phone....my upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S8 is worth it.Fabulous touch, fast and superb camera on top of it iOS 14 smoothness and features.However, it is a bit too heavy. Apple should reduce the size a little bit and weight too much.

"
"

  The phone does well in every aspect camera is good could have been more for the price your paying but is still worth it. The best case is Rhinoshield for this phone.

"
"

  This is my first iPhone since the year first iPhone was launched in India. Happy with Amazon's delivery and packaging of the product. Received genuine and original product.

"
"

  Received in perfect condition from Amazon. Just a month to be approx but worth the cost. Apple iphone dnt disappoint u.

"
"

  There is no option for return. If there os any problem with the phone and its features. You cannt return this device. Amazon says contact with Apple store . Apple store says Return not permitted.  So think carefully and enquire well about its limitations before ordering this device.

"
"

  Worth every penny.Go for it blindly.i am going to tell only the cons, you may consider rest all are pros.1.Bulky2.It takes 3 hrs to charge completely3.Low light photography is good, but not excellent.4.Single hand operation is not possible.5.loud speaker sound is good but not great.

"
"

  The above photo has been taken in compete dark without flash with no visibility.  Exceptional camera keeping in mind the small sensor, battery is surpassingly good and I‚Äôm using it in dual sim mode. As always apple products are top notch

"
"

  All rounder with a very good camera and battery life you won‚Äôt get disappointed with display though it‚Äôs an LCD with less resolution it won‚Äôt look like that . You will feel a very gud flagship experience..üòáBut better wait for 12 as there‚Äôs a chances of 11price will come down after 12 launch.

"
"

  Only missing thing is Finger print sensor,the phone is absolutely fine, nice camera nice battery life.Don't take black as it just looks like android phoneSilver & other colors looks great.Easy to use, great performance & never hangs

"
"

  This is my first iPhone that I purchased. Must say that it‚Äôs much better than any android phone. Excellent battery life, camera quality and overall performance.  Highly recommended.

"
"

  ¬†Its too goodIf u are ready to buy a wireless earphonesAnd a fast chargerDont think twice about battery its perfect ut last long than expected but u need to change some settings

"
"

  100% Original and received in completely sealed box. Am very much Impressed and happy. Amazon keeps me Amazing always.

"
"

  My phone is not working. It is getting off again and again. Restarting within 3 minutes. As apple support for customer services are closed in these days, I am really disappointed with apple. The price we are paying is not worth.

"
"

  Superb camera quality and performance!!Totally worth it under 55k and thanks to amazon to deliver it within 36 hrs....Value for money and Btw Its so much better than the samsung flagship mobile when you are getting the beast performance under 55k . Enjoyjng  it.100 % genuine  product.

"
"

  I am not high on apps / games. The default apps get my work work done. The new tech in it is put together rather well. Both the phone and I have about 50% battery left at the end of the day.

"
"

  I bought this 4 months back, its like jeevansathi now, camera and portrait mode is amazing. I just love the performance. Little bit heavy than previous models. But its okay. Wide lense is champ

"
"

  It‚Äôs apple iPhone. Writing this review after nearly 2 months of use. Happy with purchase. Very nice Face ID, battery, iOS 13, now upgraded to iOS 14.

"
"

  Received a GLITCHED phone at full price from Amazon. First time let down being an apple user. Don‚Äôt buy. Doesn‚Äôt open when you want it to, types random messages on screen. Unresponsive Siri. Doesn‚Äôt switch off. Poor product & quality.

"
"

  Its much smaller than the plus size phones. However, the OS is enjoyable and fun to use. The product came well packed.

"
"

  This iPhone is a ‚ÄúAssembled in India‚Äù product. This has been assembled in Chennai plant. iPhone 11 is a cost effective Beast. Amazon delivery was quick and the product is genuine. Highly recommended.

"
"

  First iPhone ever..and it's iPhone 11 ‚ô•Ô∏è ..Everything is Awesomeee.. especially the camera .. stabilization is perfect than any other android phone...Mic is great..crispy..very clear with great noise cancellation. Speakers are loud enough.It's a Beast !! ü§©

"
"

  It heats up quickly from the first day. I tried a lot to reduce the heating issues but it still present even in normal uses also. Lot of time called the amazon customer care but their reply was disappointing and cut the calls during the conversations. Heating issue still on after the updates and reset ma phone.

"
"

  Liked the camera a lot.Fast processing.Good audio sound.Bit Bulky if you are shifting from a small phone.Also I feel that finger scan in Iphone 7 and earlier models was better than a face recognition.Overall a good product.Satisfied customer.4 on 5.

"
"

  This is my favourite mobile, but my mob after 25days give me a problem, it‚Äôs automatically restart after 5 mint, Every time.Then I‚Äôm going to service centre for this problem, and after 1 week they give me another new sealed pack i phone 11 yellow colour. And now it‚Äôs work fine. Thank u Apple

"
"

  Camera Obviously better than Any android Phone. But As I Have Both Oneplus 8 and iPhone 11, I still Believe for Daily life OnePlus is much Better than IPhone.

"
"

  It goes without saying that green is one the best colour options to choose from and the product has me surprised in terms of build and quality.

"
"

  I am a first time iOS user.. works like butter. Camera is good. Battery life could have been better. So far so goodEdit: so its been roughly a month using this, battery is so good.. even after heavy usage it lasts for around 18 hours, that‚Äôs incredible. If u are thinking to switch from android i‚Äôd say go for it!!

"
"

  Upgraded from an iphone 6sBezels on the sides and bottom were a little larger than i expected , but it didn't bother me as it protected against unwanted touches on the sidesIf i felt anything that was upgraded , i would say the camera!

"
"

  Overall product is good in terms of battery backup, camera quality and looks. But device signal strength is not upto the mark. As device lost network time to time inside some places.

"
"

  The packaging was good. And phone of course is amazing. Facial recognition isn't as awesome to be honest. Battery backup is shockingly good compared to all the Iphones I have ever owned. I upgraded from 7 to this one and it's been a good decision so far. Also, wide angle is WOW.

"
"

  I have not received the earphones and connector i am out of the town from last many months i have checkes the box detail and it says that the box contains lighting connecter and earphones

"
"

  The phone is just awesome. Camera is superb, battery life is so far you could have got in an iPhone. Only one challenge- it doesn‚Äôt come with the 18w fast charger adapter :( . Rest, a great experience

"
"

  Camera not clarity on my phone. I think second hand phone delivered me. I am Not satisfied buy this

"
"

  I like I phone 11 because of best performance in typing ,battery life, face recognition, screen quality

"
"

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer.

"
"

  I am writing this review after using it for one day. It cost me around 53k in Sell. I am happy with my purchase camera quality is very good specially in low light and the performance is awesome. I am giving 4 star bcz my box is little damage around corner but still the phone is in good condn.

"
"

  Switching from Android to iOS and everything is amazing people are saying that phone has heating issues but I didn‚Äôt find anything related heating. After 5 days of uses Im now big fan of Apple products. Don‚Äôt think about anything just buy that product you will never regret thanks

"
"

  Absolutely loved it. Loved the colour , its so unique and refreshing.

"
"

  I wud say this s d best iphone with great battery life and worth buying ...!  Eventhough the screen looks bigger it‚Äôs absolutely handy and a typical fantabulous iphone !  Thanks to amazon prime day special offer of 59k which was a great deal last month...!

"
"

  ¬†I bought iPhone 11 45 days back. A black shade appears from the left bottom of the screen. When screen shots r taken, the pics aren‚Äôt affected by this black shade. This has appeared 2nd time in last 28 days.Is this common issue?

"
"

  All the features are same as I-phone pro max ..... only difference is i-phone  11 Pro max has three camera and I-phone 11 has two camera

"
"

  What an amazing device...! Class apart..!

"
"

  My dream phone in amazing deal

"
"

  It's camera is protruded which may get scratches once placed on some object. Also, phone is bit slippery.

"
"

  Its my first Apple product I have ever bought, and ngl, its absolutely worth it. Been using it for more than a couple of months, the phone never did disappoint. Excellent performance with one of the best camera and picture quality, super efficient RAM management, clean look, and frequent software updates, always a big yes-yes.

"
"

  As always Apple phones no issues works like a charm and good battery life. Only they should have given bigger charger with Iph 11 also.

"
"

  It's beautiful as usual apple is. Waited for a long time to purchase and finally got it. Thanks to Amazon and seller.

"
"

  The technology used for face recognition while it is good it possess huge challenges. If the phone is closer to you the phone ring volume reduces automatically. This means, you wouldn‚Äôt get phone ring and end up missing calls if you are watching any pictures, emails or videos. This is a huge issue for users

"
"

  Simply love it. Been using Apple devices since 2012. There are products with better specs in the market but this phone is nothing short of the best. Specs doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs the output that matters. Totally loving it.

"
"

  Very exited to buy this product. After bought this mobile fully surprised to use this. But when charging it take about 3 hours to get full charge. I am so embarassing. Planning to return this item. But I couldn't able to return from amzon. Please help anything do needful. Also heating while using.

"
"

  I have never imagined in my life that I would use an iPhone but thanks to amazon which provided me this amazing phone at an unbelievable price. Thanks, Apple and Amazon for this wonderful smartphone. I never felt more satisfied.

"
"

  Hangs constantly

"
"

  Device is getting heating up ... I'll check if the problem persists or not, or are there any settings which can help.

"
"

  I play pubg three finger when i shoot left fire button (uoerside ) then right corner not working...Touch issue when ur finger touch mobile frame and screen both at same time

"
"

  Don‚Äôt need reviews to buy such an awesome product , would‚Äôve bn great if it had both the finger print and Face ID especially in the prevailing covid scenario . Rest ofcourse it‚Äôs an absolute delight to use

"
"

  Amazing phone.. moving from android to iPhone and I am happy with this. Amazon did great job in delivering phone in around 6 hrs

"
"

  Camera is Great,Battery Backup is GreatLook and feel is greatBezels are bit wide but screen looks great overallSpeakers are mind blowingphone takes a while to charge since fast charger is not provided in-box,overall it's a great phone

"
"

  You wont be disappointed for sure. Delivered within 18 hours of placing the order. 7k exchange offer for 9k mobile. additional discount of amazon sale day makes the iphone 11-128 gb affordable at 58k. What more can one expect.

"
"

  Ordered on 16th (Midnight) for ‚Çπ51.7k using the Offer on Great Indian Festival Sale. It arrived the Same Day the Following afternoon.Excellent Deal and Delivery by Amazon.

"
"

  After 40 days review:iPhone 11... Super Build Quality, Best Camera, Very Good Battery Backup, display also good and over all superb!

"
"

  if u r not a pubg fan then battery will last for more time that u expect 5 6 hour of continuous use will only use abt 30% battery which is impressive for iphone 11

"
"

  Its just really a awesome phone i have ever seen, the camera is just really üëåüëå‚ù§Ô∏èüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòò next the processors are also very great , i am really very impressed from this phone , there‚Äôs a only problem with this device is the heating problem, rest all the things are really good ü•∞

"
"

  Its a best fit in 11 series . Amazing camera with true depth front camera with portrait mode. Clarity of ultra wide camera is amazing. Battery life is really good compared to other iphone models but comparatively still less than android. 64 gb is too less so 128 gb is good to go.

"
"

  Iphone is the best phone. The camera quality is superb . User interface is good. Phone doesnot slow anytime. Only battery backup is less but is manageable.

"
"

  Everything in this product is fine from packaging to device performance.The thing that annoys me is that when the delivery guy delivered me he asked me to open the package and take this device along with me and the packaging he took with him and do not handled meeü§î

"
"

  I have been reading a lot of negative reviews about seller but I have not faced any issues in my iPhone delivery or the question on the authenticity of the iPhone.Really love the amazing white beauty. No heating issues so far I have noticed.

"
"

  Everything about this phon is perfect. Amazing picture quality, long battery life (as of now), value for money as compared to 11pro. Only that the weight of the mobile is a bit more which makes it feel like carrying a brick in pocket

"
"

  Battery life is not good. Some time face recognition is problematic

"
"

  Hi everyone I am just writing the review on this phone after using 1 month.. its worth buying this phone and camera quality and OS  is excellent soo responsive. But be careful if you order it from online..please check your accessories with the service centre and whether you received all original accessories.

"
"

  Camera quality is good, even in low light conditions it performs better than it rivals, Average battery life, Still it's a overpriced phone. For sake of Brand name such premium price was not justified.

"
"

  Thanks you Amazon for delivering it within a day.This is my first iPhone and it‚Äôs been 2 days didn‚Äôt face any issue till now still exploring will update the review after a month usage.By the way got me this iPhone 11 @ RS 48000.

"
"

  I am loving it. Battery is good. Purple color is unique!!! Go for it.

"
"

  Superb phone. Camera üì∏ good . Appearance good. Nice feel in hand. Definitely recommend.

"
"

  Iphone 11 is the best phone i have the camera was superb and display was also good u can buy it im saying it because i am iphone user and i have iphone xr x 7 7 plus and 11 but there is one problem sometimes it dont show u the correct name if caller

"
"

  Just recieved the phone Yesterday , bought it for 44000 with discounts . So far amazing. The battery life is mind blowing.Camera is perfect. And iOS , I don't think I will ever use android from now . The only con I found was the charger but that is not a major issue

"
"

  This is my first Apple device and nothing to review it seems good to use also it's very simple not much complicated like android because it have only things that are needed, nothing else.

"
"

  Awesome Buy :-)Only 2 observations so far (for Apple to look for probably):1. Battery gets discharged slightly quicker on watching Videos online...2. In the box charger of 5W is slow...

"
"

  I love how the product was delivered in a good condition and on the set date. This phone has amazed me with crazy battery life and camera quality. I have directly upgraded from 6s plus 16gb to 11 128gb, so I find this phone extra useful and really comfortable

"
"

  Upgraded from 8+ and just loving it. The phone is pretty sleek and purple color looks excellent. The battery performance is very good. In terms of over performance.. well it‚Äôs iPhone so performance was never the issue even with previous versions as well.

"
"

  It's the best iPhone to buy, camera is too good, battery life is easy going for a single day heavy user, and the overall experience is top notch. I switched from Android and have no regret.

"
"

  If You want to get a premium feel then go for it for gamers i dont suggest this. And one thing they don't provide case and screen guard in the box and the saddest thing is that the charger adapter is of 5W it takes time to charge overall the build up is good

"
"

  I bought the iPhone first time. iPhone11 is the perfect phone in friendly budget. Camera is awesome and all the features of iOS 13.3 is so cool.But they should provide the Fast charger with this phone

"
"

  Great phone in terms of performance and battery life. Didn‚Äôt face any heating or camera issues. I must say it was a quickest prime delivery ever I have received on Amazon, I booked it at 12am and received at 9 in the morning.

"
"

  i can not rate this product because after purchase and make payment on 14th July 2020 i still can not use this phone. as phone is not powering on as we received on 21st July, 2020.

"
"

  Arguably the best performing phone in the market. Unmatched performance, top level camera quality and the promise and assurance of an Apple product all in one. The only issue is with the slow 5w charger which takes approx 3 hours for full charge.

"
"

  Please do not buy this product thr quality is not goodSometimes face id is not workingIt‚Äôs battery life is also not goodPlease buy it from the shop

"
"

  Apple always come with Good product and quality . Technology wise always better than other Mobiles .iPhone 11 is good mobile with more privacy and secure data .camera is awesome  both front and rearStrongly recommended .

"
"

  Phone is nice. But too costly... Its features .. Specialy its security is awesome. Most use full .and photos are captured is amazing .. go for it ..

"
"

  The only apple product i can buy with the money left in my account is Apple juice.

"
"

  Phone heats up very much, waste to purchase such high cost item which heats up in less than 10 mins of usage.I am not able to schedule a replacement for this through Amazon portal. It says 10 days replacement option. But does not accept replacement scheduling.

"
"

  So I received my iPhone 11 128gb Black from Amazon on 16 Aug exactly 7 days after I placed my order. After 2 months of gaming, music, streaming shows and films, my battery is still 100% and I‚Äôm so satisfied with the phone as well as the service provided by Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  First time iPhone user.. I must say u will fall in love with this. Best device ever used. U won‚Äôt regret at all.

"
"

  I got this phone yesterday and started using the phone today since morning.. It has suddenly started heating up. Not sure why all of a sudden it has heated up. On the lock key side it starts heating up n slowly on the back side of the phone..

"
"

  Great product..should go for it if you are really looking to buy a quality product

"
"

  I received phone bit late but the phone is just awesome. Camera quality is the best ever I seen. Battery is good. It‚Äôs handy so easy to operate.

"
"

  Awesome phone

"
"

  The best iphone that I have used till date , battery life ,camera quality & face recognition is impeccable

"
"

  I‚Äôm switching from iPhone 6 and 11!feels fast,Great face recognition. Phone is only worth half the money we are paying the other half is for Apple ecosystem. It‚Äôs like a spider web once we enter other phones looks ugly.

"
"

  It‚Äôs an Apple iPhone üì± no need for extra review thanks totally loved it üíúüíú this color looks so yummy like blueberry ice cream

"
"

  Huge Interest Charged in No Cost emi

"
"

  iPhones are some of the best phones in the market, superfast, efficient, great battery life, excellent camera. iPhones are the best gadget money can buy.

"
"

  Phone screen goes black too often...while making call as well as WhatsApp call the screen freezes and goes complete black for 3 to 4 mins ...very bad performance

"
"

  excellent camera, good battery life.. Just received yesterday, more to explore..but so happy with apple that couldn't wait anymore to post an image and thank Amazon ü§≠

"
"

  Best value for money.. It feels amazing when u hold it in your hand. Best camera and good battery life . I had s9 plus before iphone11 though s9 has best screen and amoled display .. iphone 11 does not feel any less ..it attracts everytime while in hand.Anyways best iphone you can get in good value.

"
"

  Performance and batterylife is awesome . Just loved it!

"
"

  Today received this phone, updated to ios 14, works pretty well. Cost me just Rs 40000 after bonus, cashback and instant discount. This phone is a masterpiece in this price.

"
"

  I love it. I was sure worried about buying it online.. but it turned out all good.Will update the pros and cons after a month's useüôè

"
"

  One of the best iPhone the company Apple has ever made iPhone 11 Pro might be better but this is the phone which has everything in the right amount required and points to concentrating are battery and camera. And display is not so bad it‚Äôs the best LCD display ever and even good for gaming

"
"

  Hi,I ordered this Product few days back. I m not able to access the screenshot option. It has started to get hang also. It‚Äôs just been 1 week I m using this phone. I have paid such a huge amount on buying a phone on amazon for the first time.

"
"

  I switched from 6s to 11. I feel its a great phone. Fast performance, Great battery life & Superb camera performance. Only thing i dont like is slow charge in d box.

"
"

  I was a bit confused once i read the reviews but when it delivered today everything is working fine. Once I switched it on it was heating a bit but post IOS14 update I don‚Äôt face any issue

"
"

  My first ever Iphone. Got a very speed delivery. Altough have complain about packaging there was a dent in my iphone box, seems like mishandlingWould appreciated if packaging would have arrived in bubble wrap box.Rest loving the phone

"
"

  Lightening Fast..Excellent Camera, display and battery backup..If you r coming from iphone 6/7/8, you won‚Äôt feel lack of OLED screen..Siri is at best in iphone11..Go for it..

"
"

  The phone works amazing, face recongnition works perfect on daylight and sometimes dont work at night,Good Battery and better ios updatedApple music comes free for 6 months.My view: Go for black colour if you have a client facing role...

"
"

  The phone is sexy ..looks great ... came in a nice package .... camera is just üòò...is fast and the face id is fastest

"
"

  Awesome iPhone 11Best Battery üîã life & process

"
"

  ¬†Camera is not up to the level in my point Bcas I m using android for more than 10years... Battery level nice...but charging time in these times 5w in the box for 73k is much more costly.... Over all a gud product

"
"

  I am in love with my iPhone 11. Previously I was using iPhone 6. The performance and battery life is extremely super comparing to my previous iPhone.

"
"

  I was really worried about from the negative comments that amazon not deliver original product...but really thanks amazon for iPhone 11 for just 59k as product is original and no heating or any issue so buy without any second thought

"
"

  Camera quality is very good. Battery life is average. Face unlock works fine. Overall satisfied with Amazon delivery of the product. Delivery boy helped me to take video while unboxing phone for first time to avoid any problem in case of fraud.

"
"

  Top in brand top in quality top in feature.

"
"

  A good product but you need to check the price in your near by location before paying almost 5k extra , that is  with  HDFC card and with other card too.

"
"

  Best Iphone ever used. Camera is awesome!

"
"

  There is no fast charger you should provide. Nobody have 5 hours dail to charge a phone.Very disappointed with charger.

"
"

  iPhone 11 gives all what you wish in phone and it's impossible in any other brand at this price. Specs may be visibly higher in android mobiles but hardware to software coordination output with almost zero issues is delivered by this mobile.

"
"

  Great phone considering the price. Typically Apple, everything works as expected. However, Face ID can be much better. Overall, a great phone!

"
"

  I also got extra discount on my credit card. Bought it for a friend. Apple always never fail.

"
"

  Damamged phone received and amaozn couldnt replace it back bcz they are a bunch of idiots with computers in front of them

"
"

  Bought iPhone 11 in Amazon sale. Very nice product. Quick delivery. And of course the product which I bought i.e iphone11 deserves full 5 stars. Thanks Amazon and seller for genuine and nice product.

"
"

  Best i phone 11 and best price rs 59990Apple day 25 AUGUST  DELIVERY DATE BEST 29 August woho image I phone 11 thanks Amazon.in real products Apple

"
"

  Overall product works well. However i received cosmetic damaged phone. Amazon customer care suggested refund and no replacement as  the product is out of stock. As it is primary phone and no time to wait for newer phone. Hence decided to live with it.

"
"

  Amazon experience is so goodFastest delieveryIphone 11 best phone and budget phone in 2019-2020Purchased on apple days saleThanks amazonüòä

"
"

  It was an excellent and safe delivery process followed and I revived the phone in a perfect condition

"
"

  If you're a gamer, it will give you around 5 hrs non stop gaming, It doesn't the charging process in around 1.5 hrs 0 to 100,Camera quality is good in outdoor conditions, in indoor the front camera has more Noise, the renders were not that good

"
"

  Its just an amazing phone. I upgraded from iphone 7 to this and it was worth upgrading. From camera to the A13 bionic chip everything works flawlessly in conjunction with IOS. I got it for just 48000 INR during the amazon sale so it was a great deal.

"
"

  Pros : very good camera and water resistantCons: if you have video call on whats app it will drain ur full battery in 2 hrs battery backup should have been increased

"
"

  The phone is amazing and i am loving the battery backup and performance of the phone.go for it ul never regret it.camera is marvelous.

"
"

  Nice upgrade from my iPhone 7, got a good deal with HDFC credits card and amazon.

"
"

  buy this and love  forever.Don't worry about negative comment. And fearless buy it. Its Genuine Product. Thankfully to Amazon and its offering Amazon great india festive sale. I got it 45000.

"
"

  nice purchasegot it from amazon .nice camera , superb night mode.if you need a best camera mobile under 70k then go for this.

"
"

  The best, what else can I say. The A13 best chip in the mobile market, the cameras throw the mobiles with 4 r 5 cameras out in gutter. Battery life is pretty good to for an Apple iPhone, Certainly not like the 4K r 5k androids. iOS 13.6 is breezy.

"
"

  Ive bought green 256gb variant. And its amazing! The device is adorable beast! OS and performance is buttery.

"
"

  Battery life is reached as it isCamera quality always better on all iPhoneFace recognition is good so no on screen fingerprint option

"
"

  Buying an iphone was a dream from my school time's,,, this was the 1st iphone ive ever used.. Very satisfied with quality of iphone.. And smooth perfomance,, good battery life.. Wow camare experience.. Over all very very satisfied with the product

"
"

  Display issue:The display of phone was gone completely after using for a month.Did not expect this from iPhone 11.

"
"

  I received a defective phone the calls and speaker sound is distorted... have raised a complaint with Apple assistant n they hv asked me to observe my phone for 24 hrs ... now I just blew money n here I m waiting .... very disappointed

"
"

  What an experience... one has to live it to be able to understand what it is...in love with Apple!

"
"

  It takes more than 4 hours to charge. You definitely have to buy a fast charger. Moreover shift from android to apple has its own perks and drawbacks which can be ignored but it hangs alot which was not expected from apple.

"
"

  Battery is not as expected...camera is 5/5...Face recognition stucks in dark.

"
"

  Lovely mobile but bankers have hidden charges and rate of interest shown on page are not correct

"
"

  Little cracked from the backside around the camera..glass has broken down.. dont know how...help me out with this

"
"

  The camera quality is better as compared to one+ and Samsung enrich S series, battery life is 2 days if you use interest regularly and the face recognition is normal as available in various phones now

"
"

  Using phone from last 3 months. Working everything superb and got it in one day delivery. Thank you Amazon

"
"

  Features are goodGetting heated occassionallyGetting stuck occassionallyThree taps on screen is the solution if screen is expanded...

"
"

  I liked the whole phone most with awesome speed in launching apps and the whole performance  is pretty  good, the only thing that disappointed in this product they had given 5W adapter which takes to charge the phone more than 2 and half hours

"
"

  I paid through Amazon hdfc credit card they mentioned bonus offer & instant discount, I contacted customer care they said it will be credited within 3 days, after 3 days I contacted again they said this product is not eligible for bonus offer.

"
"

  Thanks  Amazon received the product with in two days. I phone 11 is a good phone but in case of battery is taking more time to charge and battery life is ok better than my previous  I phone 7

"
"

  I am fully satisfied with the phone performance so far . It is great upgrade .People who are already using iPhone 4 to 8 can upgrade to iPhone11. It is nice phone indeed .

"
"

  Amazing Product üëå. One of the best phone in world, battery üîã life is also quit good , camera quality is too good üòå,I m shifted on 11 from iPhone 7+ Best experienceThank Amazon for deal @48K

"
"

  Reviewing after using 2 months.No words for the quality and camera of this product, it is just fabulous.Price is quite cheap than other models.Display could have been OLED.Battery life is good.

"
"

  Switched from android to iphone.... Feels premium... Everything is premium quality.... Phone feels great to hold.... display is very soothing to eyes.... But the battery heats up very fast that's the only minus point...

"
"

  If you have used iphone pro models like X, XS,XS MAX you are not gonna like it and if you are buying after 7, 8 you will like it: HENCE DONT BUY IT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED AND SUPER AMOLER OR OLED DISPLAYS. the diffrence is real

"
"

  I have recieved iphone 11 black color as per d order...but display seems to be yellow compare to my friends iphone11 also i have cross checked display settings its all d same as my friends phone but still display doesnot look white n bright

"
"

  Purple is cool. And product is original. Checked it on apple site.

"
"

  Sir i am facing battery issue with my iphone 11, with only 2 month uses i have lost 2% of battery health can you suggest me any settings or resolve my issue?

"
"

  iPhone is absolutely good. Delivered in given time , thumbs up for that. Got genuine iPhone. Work's very nice , camera is also working very good. I haven't faced any heating problem.

"
"

  the price is high. but some of the features are very interesting

"
"

  Started having issues with battery life and also there is some problem with mobile network strength. 4G doesnt work properly. When answer to call and put in ears, voice surrounds in ear.

"
"

  Apple is apple. After shifting from android to iOS little bit difficult. But the best thing is the app notifications & permissions. The security is awesome.

"
"

  Don‚Äôt judge its battery life by looking at mah its very good it doesn‚Äôt have oled or FHD screen still its way better than other smartphones with LCD

"
"

  I was waiting for a long time to experience Iphone 11 and amazon once again provided on time delivery along with genuine iphone assembled in India.Overall very much satisfied switching to ios from android.

"
"

  Apple iphone 11 which is better than older iphone like xr. It is value for money and. Stronger glass front and back side. Display is amazing not good not bad

"
"

  ¬†Perfect phone in this price. Most successful phone of iphone.

"
"

  I would suggest you to buy 11 than a pro , it feels great to have this phone.

"
"

  The phone is just awesome.. Delivery  by amazon was prompt. Packaging has been done perfectly. Camera no doubt the best. Except for the finger print option this phone is great. Go for it without any doubt.

"
"

  It‚Äôs my first apple product Awesome performance  battery life also so good best for long term use under 50k best option don‚Äôt worry about display resolution is just HD+ but it‚Äôs chip and software support 4K iOS 14 update 4K playing well

"
"

  In love with this thing.don't think much about it, just buy it and it's superb and worth your kidney.Just one thing, the charger is kind of slow as the phone itself supports 18 W charger, but apple gave us just 5 W.Earpods, not airpods.

"
"

  I am an iPhone user from a very long time, and this the best value for money. I love the camera quality plus the screen size is very convincing. Face recognition sometime takes time. Battery backup is really really good. Would recommend this iPhone to everyone. In budget the best iPhone

"
"

  The iPhone charger came with box is not goodIts not charging my iPhone when battery low.After plugging this with several switches it might start charging.This is very bad experience for me with  this brand new mobile.

"
"

  As a first time iPhone user, I just love using this phone. I got a very beautiful colour. But the delivery of the product took so long. Btw good

"
"

  Phone was awesome but heated in few minutes. Amazon do not replace this item so kindly read return or replace policy before buying this phone

"
"

  Absolutely amazing ‚ô•Ô∏è Best iphone ever.I was using iphone 6 since last 3 years and now upgraded to iphone 11. This smartphone is a beast for sure: 4k video recording/ Amazing camera even in night. Nothing can be better than this phone‚úåüèª

"
"

  Purchased it on 22 july and got delivered in next 2-3 days!!! But after 1 month of use, left earphone not working properly. Dont know how to log complain for accessories issue!

"
"

  No words to define such a lovely product at such a amazing price range. I got this for 64900 thanks to hdfc bank. Each and every aspect of this phone is awesome.

"
"

  ¬†Giving 5V charger üò°Taking 55k  NICE apple üçíAbout phone it's good üòäüòÅBut you will face some problem like slow charging and heating issues

"
"

  Best budget friendly iPhone to buy. The display could have been better. Rest everything is beyond comparison. Overall worth every penny.

"
"

  The phone is rlly cool. First of all iPhone 11 is rlly very classy. Face recognition in dark. And amazon also gave warranty for tis product. They gave the warranty till sharp one year

"
"

  charger is heating very much. no support from amazon just after u get delivery. i should have bought such expensive phone from apple store only

"
"

  I was a bit worried about how the condition of the product would be..after reading a lot of negative reviews.. especially about the seller .. but I got a genuine new iPhone 11 without any issues . Thanks a lot .

"
"

  Iphone 11‚Äôs battery possesses a really great real time battery backup, amazing picture quality and great dynamic dolby surrounding music quality speakers. And all other feature that justifies it‚Äôs price value. So, blindly go for it guyss.

"
"

  Has almost all features.Only issue is the charger that comes with the phone is 5W. Charging takes 5 hrs.

"
"

  Battery after full charge is draining out with in 12 hours of normal use only. Remaining featured are OK

"
"

  iPhone 11 cannot be disliked..it's the best phone and an economy purchase post XR.

"
"

  I have received my iphone 11 on last Monday 10-08-2020 as per te given by Amazon , I am really happy with the phone & delivery time ,but o want give a suggestion that you should rap the iphone bow with bubble polythene ......rest is good üëç

  Excellent phone and the touch and feel is awesome and performance is at at top class.

"
"

  Charging problem. This phone take around 5 hours for full charging. This is negative point. Please replace this phone if possible. Second thing amazon costumer care number doesn‚Äôt work that‚Äôs way very difficult to coordinate.

"
"

  An iPhone is an iPhone... nothing much to loose compared to 11 pro apart from led display and telephoto rest all is equipped in iphone11 just go for it.

"
"

"

  The problem I am facing is sometimes the background light vanished while attempting a call so , u can‚Äôt add calls or look into any other stuff during call or even cannot on the speaker

"
"

  This is first time I moved to iOS from Android and it's amazing. This phone is performing exceptional very well with A13 bionic chipset on it. My main purpose was gaming to buy this phone and I found worth to spend lot of money on it.

"
"

  My first iPhone , I'm very happy that I purchased  an I phone in best offer during Amazon great Indian sale .Best time to purchase iPhone on Amazon great Indian sale  .I bought iPhone 11 at 48000 during offer period

"
"

  Very good product but a dent on the device is there and some roughness on the back of product but otherwise good one

"
"

  Upgraded SE to 11A 12 megapixel selfie camera is very good and Quality of the photos is simply superb, A13 chip gives a very good and smooth performance, awesome battery life, best ever smartphone in this price range from apple.Thank you Apple.

"
"

  The aesthetic look of the phone is worth the price. The specifications are excellent. However, I don‚Äôt get why the phone is heating up so easily without doing any heavy work. Could it because of the software? Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the product looks and performances.

"
"

  Anyone can buy iPhone  and do online payment without any hesitation. It's totally safe and convenient. Please guys purchase iPhone if you want to and its the best time for it.

"
"

  Great

"
"

  Same day delivery. Purchased during Amazon Great Indian Festival with great offer.

"
"

  If I can‚Äôt say awesome then it‚Äôs a waste of money hence it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAwesome‚Äù

"
"

  Packing problem its not a genuine company packing. I want to replace or return.

"
"

  Excellent IPhone model. I am first time user of APPLE product

"
"

  The rate is too high. Display is deemed.

"
"

  ¬†Upgraded from 6s to 11. Too good. Loving it. Got it for ‚Çπ63,900. A bit expensive but worth every penny.

"
"

  The camera and the performance of the phones are very good but the battery life is not good also the charging time is more and it takes more than two hours to fully charge the phone.

"
"

  The best apple can offer for this price. Wide camera is not used very often so i feel XR could be better purchase.

"
"

  We are fan ok apple üçé we love tge product

"
"

  Worst product

"
"

  Yes Best Experience

"
"

  I think because of last 10 years I used China phone bec of Ladakh problems I shift to iPhone am not the person to spend that much money for phone but I think iPhone 11 is great choice is best

"
"

  Apple has its own quality,but Amazon fulfilled our (middle class)dreams ....thank you Amazon @greatindianfestival...‚Äùamazon, har pal khusiyon ki‚Äùüòä

"
"

  Apple did a decent job in the 11 line up series. battery was great and yes what else you need .?

"
"

  Awesome product experience. Face ID unlock is amazing.

"
"

  Overall I Love this iPhone 11. It's camera attract me a lot. Siri is also working fine.Apple should give a fast charger with this varient.Apart from charger, everything is just outstanding

"
"

  The build quality of the phone is poor. The screen developed a hairline crack after four months of use. The battery health shows the maximum capacity reduced to 89% post five moths of use.

"
"

  Simply the best & the beast... premium look...very handy...smooth performance...camera could have been a little better. But that's ok...bought for my wife...she is happy...so I am happy...üíï

"
"

  Great camera quality. Smooth and fast OS (as compared to Android latest software upgrade).Better battery life though takes a long time with regular apple charger.Worth the value.

"
"

  Box was damaged. Thank god phone was safe.Very poor packaging from the vendor

"
"

  A tough decision to change from Android to iOS but, worth it. The camera, battery life, accessibility, sound quality is just superb from day one. Haven‚Äôt noticed any issues at all. Don‚Äôt think will switch back to Android ever!!! Cheers to Apple!

"
"

  Best phone üí™üí™üí™

"
"

  Battery is average. Camera is good under good lighting conditions but in normal light it is not upto the value. Face recognition is same as old phones no improvement

"
"

  Excellent product , my 2nd Apple Device ! Best performance you can get right now in a smartphone and which will last for 5-7 yeats

"
"

  Has to be an Outstanding Product as its Apple. 10/10.

"
"

  Heating issue ... But not replace buy Amazon ...

"
"

  On time delivery by Amazon & as stated by most of the customers regarding heating issue I did not find one.You can go for it as I am completely satisfied with the seller & the product.

"
"

  One of the best iphone under affordable price in GREAT INDIAN SALE .Better the iphone comes up with 18W adapter and not 5W.Usaully 5W adapter takes 2 hrs to charge up 0-100%.Only its the major problem in it.

"
"

  Everything is good but when you play extensive games like call of duty, pubg, your batter will drain faster.

"
"

  You can not get over of best in class features and camera and touch and look of course.

"
"

  Mobile is fabulous.. Camera quality is awesome which give the actual feel. You can compare this with DSLR camera. Battery Back is good as expected. Overall mobile is brilliant and beast.

"
"

  Great camera, speed is good, no lag while playing games.But i don't like the battery backup. Otherwise iphone is superb. Very classy experience.

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  Just a perfect, all round phone with every important smartphone feature implemented nicely.  Forget all the specs hype and get this for straight up simplicity, great battery life and fantastic optics.

"
"

  The charger of this I phone doesn‚Äôt charge my phone, it stopped working and it hasn‚Äôt been 6 months since I bought this handset hence please provide replacement for my charger or repair the charger, it‚Äôs of great inconvenience

"
"

  Great product. Thanks Amazon for delivering it faster.

"
"

  Great product..much better battery life than the previous versions...and the power of the bionic chip is incomparable.

"
"

  Excellent phone, delivered in 2 days, works like a charm. Definitely worth buying at this price

"
"

  iPhone 11 is the best to buy among others in 2020 because of its excellent camera, battery life and user experience. Of course With recent price cut and amazon offer, it‚Äôs a steal deal to get.

"
"

  If you can afford it go forThe phone is really good and I upgraded from a s7 edge so this is a really good deal

"
"

  If you are an iPhone lover then it's worth upgrading to this phone. Battery lasts all day and then some. Camera is Ofcourse great. Only thing is that it feels heavier especially if you are coming from iphone 6,7,8

"
"

  Good device, features are good and provides tips very often to keep updated with the phone. I switched from iPhone 7 to 11. The experience has been great so far. Haven‚Äôt checked about the wireless charging yet.

"
"

  The phone is good and working nicely till date.  Highly recommend.

"
"

  Excellent purchase. One of the best phones available in market in 2019.

"
"

  No words not to describe just awesome products Close your eyes and buy it if you need ‚úåüèª

"
"

  Nice phone and quality dammn good awesome ...camera quality too awesome .I love it thanks amazon

"
"

  Very poor performance batteryiOS badMain no return policySo pls no west moneyNo solution my problems

"
"

  Great product, no problems till date. Camera quality is increased and battery life is also pretty decent. Overall happy with the product

"
"

  Camera quality is excellent but the battery life is the sad part and charger is to cry for (slowest charging)

"
"

  Amazing Product by Apple, as usual!Go for a higher rating charger incase you need fast charging!

"
"

  Phone is stuck since last night over herCant go furtherI received this i phone 11 yesterdayIt is not working properlyI guess i got delivered a faulty productNot happyüò°

"
"

  I have switched from android to IOS and iphone11 is a promising device for me to keep selecting IOS in coming future.Its comfortable in hand, great grip, the added new features makes it easier to use.

"
"

  Its overall a great phone..got it for rs 62900..go for it guys ..u will never regret..good battery life, great camera and performance...good packaging and delivery by amazon..

"
"

  This is my First i phone, owner all nice performance but the only problem is lots of apps are in paid mode in appstore be carefull before purchasing if you are app savvy person.

"
"

  It‚Äôs a performance king..........the best performance u can find in any smart phone......the camera quality isn‚Äôt that great when compared to dslr........n d battery heats up a lot with an avg battery life

"
"

  The delivery is very fast I got it before 48 hours.I ordered it Friday 2:00 PM and got it Sunday 10:12 Amazing delivery and same product received..The phone is very no heating problems.

"
"

  Everything is fine for me, but seeing diwali sale, i feel like I am cheated. I bought it for 64k but now it is available for 53k only with Power adaptor n earpods. Seems so unfair to me..

"
"

  Battery life is not that great and the charger comes in box is very disappointing as per 2020. Rest of the part is pretty great. Delivered on very next day.

"
"

  Worth for value of money..it is not comparable with other brands

"
"

  Excellent iPhone ever... with amazing camera quality & fastest face unlocking system. Battery stands goodBought iPhone 11 128gb only fa 53k thanks to amazon for this great deal....

"
"

  Amazing product just worth the value and the big thing is got off more than ‚Çπ15,000Amazing  deal prime day sale‚ô•Ô∏è

"
"

  Only simple review. 5 Star Product by Apple !! 5 Star Service/Delivery by Amazon. This is why both are the best companies & having highest Market cap. A Big thumsup to Apple üëç

"
"

  A beast in your pocket

"
"

  Satisfied with the iphone 11Got the 128 Gb for ‚Çπ65900But Apple should give the 12 watt charger in box and the quality of the cable also should be improved.

"
"

  Battery life sucks my oneplus has a better battery backup, and the camera quality is also just overrated basically its just wasting your money by buying apple products

"
"

  Even if it has low resolution than samsung premium phones but it doesn‚Äôt look bad . Overall quality of apple is simply best. Camera quality is brilliant.Look is premium. Recommended!

"
"

  I was having lots of questions after reading the reviews, majorly were about excessive heating of the phone. I found no such issue, totally satisfied with the phone.

"
"

  phone heats up a lot during voice and video calls.

"
"

  I don't know why people have bad things to say about the product or the delivery.IPhone 11 is a beastAlso the product is genuineDon't give a second thought.

"
"

  My charger is not working

"
"

  Its great deal, I got this iphone for 45K. Thanks to Amazon. No words to say about iphone. iphone is always no1 and best and smart.

"
"

  Never buy apple products on Amazon, I had worse experience of buying iphone 11. I got a refurbished phone for a premium price more over there is no customer support at all on the app.

"
"

  Excellent product and meets my expectations!

"
"

  Wonderful phone. Love the colour.

"
"

  Processor speed and touch sensor is amazing,Camera features are added advantage to this device.But mobile weighs more and this needs to reduce in upcoming models

"
"

  chrger missing in this box

"
"

  Thank you appario retail pvt ltd for delivering a genuine product. iPhone 11 is just wow, love it

"
"

  Excellent buy! Love this product. Original for sure. Loved the delivery timings and handling.

"

"
"

  Awesome but battery little bit weekAfter all mast Love This One

"
"

  Camera quality very good üòç

"
"

  iPhone is always better......aside this Amazon is also best. This is my 2nd IPhone bought from Amazon. Every time i have got genuine product and also 6k instant discount on HDFC card.

"
"

  No such quality in camera or battery that one should spend Rs60,000.Instead go for one plus or Samsung

"
"

  After so long finally it is in hands. Good to but if you are using lower version of iphone below X or lower iphones.

"
"

  iPhone never disappoints you!And the purple color is just perfect üíú

"
"

  The product is good , camera quality is nice , battery life is also good . It got glass finish which looks pretty . My only concern is that it weights heavy other than that it‚Äôs a nice phone

"
"

  Battery life is improved considerably compared to previous models, recent iOS 14 makes this phone at par with excellence.

"
"

  Delighted with camera, face recognition performance.

"
"

  Excellent battery life , camera quality is very Excellent ,good looking and a14 prfomens is very Excellent.

"
"

  I was using samsung j2 2016 for 4.5 years and now upgraded to Iphone 11 directly and I must tell you that the experience this phone tends to offer you is just next level!

"
"

  What more to say. Apple any day. 4 apple from amazon

"
"

  It‚Äôs a very cool phone . Function like a breeze.. no problem anytime.. So smooth ..Moreover, purple colour is totally different and unique .

"
"

  Product is best .I need invoice

"
"

"
"

  Good product good battery and camera five starMy dream phone ,happy customer ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Shifted from Android to IOS and it is truly amazing. Camera quality of this phone is great with truly natural colors.This phone is a complete package and a value for money phone if u r looking to shoft from android to ios.

"
"

  GREAT PHONE! but the Amazon packaging was not so good

"
"

  Loved the build quality, even the smallest parts are built with perfection and best quality stuff.

"
"

  Amazon dropped the price a month after I bought it so a bit of regret there...

"
"

  Iphone to Iphone h

"
"

  My first apple product....amazing quality...face id is much secured.... camera quality is awesome perhaps the best camera ever on a smartphone....battery is a bit disappointing ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üòçü§©

"
"

  Worst battery life nd charging problem.Can't able to reach any suitable person regarding this.

"
"

  Battery life is OK....camera üì∏ quality is good...n face recognition also good...quality product by üçè....always satisfied.....overall experience is good....

"
"

  With the new iOS 14 its even better, but there is 1 problem, it doesn‚Äôt have fast charging like one plus that‚Äôs the only disadvantage for me.

"
"

  Nice product  did u know that i phone ""battery life"" is normal and ""camera quality"" is best than any onther android and fast ""face recongnition"" than any other android

"
"

  Don‚Äôt hesitate to buy it, I got a good deal of 48k. Feeling lucky... just go for it...

"
"

  It‚Äôs a great phone. Really loved it. Only negative is ‚Äòtouch‚Äô response . If you were a Samsung or one plus user sometimes you will feel slightly slow response when you touch the display. Otherwise no complaints.

"
"

  Perfectly delivered by amazon on time, secured packing, no damage, all parts found, no defect seen till date. Happy with the experience .Got at the best price in market assured.

"
"

  Camera superb design is also good proper handy phone..........

"
"

  Till now the best phone I‚Äôve ever purchased. It‚Äôs my 1st iPhone. I used to own a OnePlus 5. Was a bit skeptical about iPhone, but to my surprise the phone is amazing.

"
"

  If you are planning for an iPhone, just go for the iPhone 11. Worth every penny and trust me you wont be disappointed. I am loving the experience with 0 issues and problems what so ever

  Good camera quality.

"
"

  Received defective product. Speaker is not working properly and charging adapter has heating problem

"
"

  Display poor and over heat

"
"

  Its over all a good phone. If it would have been same size as 7. It would have been more comfortable

"
"

  face recognition is a little bit slow but photos are awsome

"
"

  iPhone 11 ticks all the right boxes to be a flagship except charging (if you could afford go for 11 pro /pro max

"
"

  Great Deal üëçüëçValue for money

"
"

  Superb phone. Absolute value for money.

"
"

  The product is verry good,  but mostly what like is the delivery timing and cost..Well done amazone u knew what Indians want... Value for money... Jai hind

"
"

  Like it‚Äôs UI, user experience, the swiftness, battery is quite good. No snappy behaviour. Overall wonderful buy.

"
"

  Everything is good except the battery life could have been better. For heavy mobile users the battery wouldn‚Äôt be sufficient for a day. They say 17 hrs but i dont think it lasts that much.

"
"

  As usual great product from Apple. Amazing interface and superb response time. Camera is just awesome especially in the dark. Great battery life too. On time delivery by Amazon is the icing on the cake‚ò∫Ô∏è

"
"

  Poor battery life compare to my oneplus 6T, not good purchase tome

  Upgraded from iPhone 7 plus. This one is simple a beast. Go for it!

"
"

  Amazing phone in this price range  switching from OnePlus 6 to iPhone 11. I can see the difference already..

"
"

  ITS AMAZING...We first feared about what product will be delivered because we dont really order electronic devices online but this was just a great experience

"

  Awesome phone, excellent picture quality and battery life gives nearly 1 full day

"
"

  I need to return the iphone 11 because the camera quality is s to worst

  Nice phone but battery life could have been better.Night mode is awesomeiCloud sync is no hassle and works very well

"
"

  Higher  prices for iphoneYou will get better quality in lesser price go for one plus

"
"

  The battery life is soo poor. It takes almost 2-3 hours to charge completely.

"
"

  Great phone

"
"

  For the very first time apple is giving soo much of features at this price point.I got it for 58900 with HDFC offer soo it's a mustbuy if you're looking for a camera centric phone.

"
"

  I got it for 51073 with amazon great Indian festival. phone is got light heat up for 30 mins usage. I used for only camera. Low camera quality is not good.

"
"

  iPhone's camera quality is the best and with this iPhone 11 it's improved. it's worth it.

"
"

  Happy with the product and delivery

"
"

  Original product, working good, fast delivery

"
"

  It‚Äôs an Genuine product, I had my doubts but by ordering this & getting the perfect device made trust amazon more. Previously I ordered AirPods 2 that was also good.

"
"

  Phone heating is serious concern in this variant and Apple should do something for this as this is expensive phone and should not have such issue

"
"

  I am extremely dis satisfied with the camera quality. Other IPhone has better quality when both kept aside. This is a damaged camera altogether I believe.

"
"

  Despite the lockdown, Amazon delivered it on time. I was worried about the product but finally received it in good condition. I am very satisfied

"
"

  The phone quality is superb!!Appreciative Camera quality and face recognition too.Glad to order from Amazon, got good discount too ;)

"
"

  Charging very, it's take a lot of time to full charge and battery it's fine as such now.Camera it's very nice.Face recognition some time not detected.

"
"

"
"

  Face ID is not getting enough space,to unlock, as it is seen in YouTube by you tubers, not so good battery life, some features are good in camera, but not so good

"
"

  Ordered on 17th october 2020 for Rs. 48999.. seller was darshita electronics . Product is genuine and all the apple accessories are included in the box.

"
"

  This is a good phone. I bought it on Amazon Prime Day and I get a huge amount of discount.Thank you, Amazon. ‚ù§  It's mean a lot.

"
"

  Camera quality is great, battery life won‚Äôt support you much if you‚Äôre a heavy user. Sometimes not even a whole day. Sometimes phones gets heat up a little after usage for a while.

"
"

  Prompt delivery n original product good service

"
"

  Got this Phone at 46,500/- üòçüòç worth deal

  Bought it from amazon on this festival sale for around 50k, really happy and looking forward to use my first apple device!!

"
"

  Good purchase with reasonable price

"
"

  Amazing phone. This has been one of the best buys ever. Maybe on the higher side but delivers the quality is should for the price point.

"
"

  Battery life is good. Camera quality excellent  Specially night mode is awesome. And face recognition is also good

"
"

  Best in all

"
"

  Look is goodOsm product

"
"

  Superb

"
"

  The phone is amazing. I am an Apple lover so I love everything about Apple but the face recognition feature is a bit disappointing.

"
"

  First iPhone after almost a decade of using android platform.

"
"

  Best camera in market....iPhone 11 and 12 have almost identical camera setup with same sensors other than telephoto lens!!

"
"

  I have recently switched from android to IOs. I can say it's worth every penny I bought..

"
"

  Bought I prime deal in 59,900 with icici cash back deal extremely happy with the purchase

"
"

  Battery life is more than 1day with InternetCamera quality is very goodFace recognition is super fast

"
"

  There is no fingerprint scanner in iphone11 But face id is there and which is up to mark No Doubt on that. Happy with the product.

"
"

  :pIt‚Äôs a good one just go for it if it‚Äôs in your budget.Con : it‚Äôs big.(That‚Äôs what she said)

"
"

  It was awesome product.Battery, cameras, sound quality is genuinely outstanding.Display quality is also good.

"
"

  Battery- Good, face recognition- super, phone quality- Excellent. I‚Äôm proud of use this phone. Amazon service- Excellent.

"
"

  Perfect built quality. On a expensive side

"
"

  Overall good performance, good camera quality, Battery performance also more or less good but adaptor Super Slow

"
"

  Good phone but it seems to be costly

"
"

  Very good

"
"

  Genuine Product. Best Phone ever. Appario Retail pvt ltd. can surely be trusted for future purchases. Don‚Äôt be afraid of anything

"
"

  Amazing purchase. Loved it completely. Was confused between OnePlus, Samsung phones and IPhone. I am glad that I chose Iphone 11.

  Don‚Äôt buy Apple product from amazon they provide faulty phone and they didn‚Äôt take it back in the return policy.

"

  All are know about apple brand it's excellent. But your specifications description it's dual SIM mobile . It's single single SIM mobile...

"

  Good product and good and secures delivery by Amazon. Have no issue.

"
"

  Really happy with the phone!! Face recognition can be improved further.

"
"

  Good product

"

  Phone audio out put is very low for some videos , in spite of full volume

"
"

  A bit heavy than my prior iphone 6s... but can be ignored as the phone runs so smooth...! Best camera and battery..!!

"
"

  Amazing fast delivery service by amazon, phone is awsome as i bought it after watching a lot of reviews. Just go for it.

  Worst phone to buy from amazon. The battery started with an issue as not recognised and needs repair in just 3 months of buying from amazon

"

  Excellent Product. Now you can give away your kidney instead of actually paying for the phone. Two amazon certified surgeons came at my place. The operation for my kidneys was beautifully done and then I received the phone. You can also transfer intellectual property through amazon pay now. That could be one of your options. In my case, I did both, LMAOO.

  Please don't buy iPhones from iphone.. If you want to buy please go to apple store. Don't think for extra 3k when you buy from apple store. See the 1 star reviews, they are not lying. Think about them.. Buying an mobile atba cost of 70000 and the product is defective, if you ask a replace in amazon, they won't replace the product. They will direct you to apple store. When you go to apple store they will not help the customer who bought a product from amazon, now you can't do anything. The 70000rs is just a waste. Please don't buy iPhone from amazon. Just go to apple store and buy. Yes apple store don't reduce the price.. But if you buy a iphone from apple store and you got a problem they will help you.. If can't they will replace your mobile free of cost. Think about it.. Buying a iphone less for 3k and got a problem, you have to suffer and waste of time for you. I am not telling all the iphones are defective in amazon. Some product and some particularly some seller making the mistakes, they are knowingly making the mistakes. Please but a iphone in apple store.

  Upgrading from iPhone 7 Red 256GB to 11 is nothing short of exciting to me!Pros:1. Camera. CAMERA! Night-mode! Wide-angle!2. Battery life. No one told me that iPhone batteries last more than half a day. This one does for a FULL day!3. Performance. Phenomenal! I run mobile games on full graphics and the phone does not break a sweat!4. Software. Apple should be lauded for iOS. No bloatware, no lags, no over-the-time performance decay!5. Screen. Even though this has LCD, Apple has done a phenomenal job in making it the best available right now.6. Build Quality. Do I need to say anything about Apple's this aspect? Premium! Phenomenal!7. Design. Truly professional looking compared to the Pro/Pro Max gas-stove looks!Cons: (I'm nitpicking, believe me you!)1. No fast charger in the box. What a dud for such an expensive phone!2. Could have come in OLED at this price-point.

  well size  and its all colour is very good design is very good  features.but one thing is same according to me the camera quality  of 8 plus and  iphone x and 11 almost same but design is too good battery life too good  it consist alll the things but it also affects our pocket . on the other hand every thing is excellent no issuebut one problem is that after some time why battery is affected  I dont know why  but its a true fact.all products of apple is very good  i have no words to complement  all goooooooooooooooooood

"

  Yes it‚Äôs iPhone and iPhones are good. iPhone 11 is my first one. Different UI from android phones, So takes little time to adjust.1. Camera is one of the best in class i would say, mind blowing details in photos2. Battery life is awesome, i hear the older iPhones never used to have battery backup like this one, well if u were an android user then they had good battery backup mobiles3. Sometimes I see lag Especially the iMovie4. Face recognition is really good5. There isnt any lag in games i played, not high def games thoughI am Totally satisfied with its performanceiOS 14 on the way so sit tight, fingers crossedThanksGod

  May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch , but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon

"

  Although I dint buy it from amazon but I‚Äôll still tell u how good it actually is! I‚Äôm a college student and a heavy user. My day begins at 5 when I put my iPhone 11 on charge and i remove it at 92-96% of charge. I read books , listen to music , play cod and Pubg along with clash Royale watch YouTube and listen to music. My day ends at 2300hrs and I‚Äôm always left out with approx 32-46% battery. The standby time is just great no battery drains when not in use and I mean it ! No battery drains. That A13 Bionic is just a beast and let‚Äôs just not talk about the performance. A true destructive amazing fast performance is always guaranteed. I have no regrets reshooting from android to this phone! Buy it and enjoy it guys!

  After using iphone11 for months, these are some problem I am facing. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs software or hardware problem.Problem with Iphone 11 are1.Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt recognise face to open the lock, need to restart the iphone to solve this problem.2.It gets hang sometimes, then gets restarted automatically.3.Dot appears in photos taken in sunny day due to its camera lens.4.Front sensor doesn‚Äôt work accurately.Because of these problems, I think it‚Äôs not worth buying such expensive mobile. Disappointed üëéüèª

  The seller and Amazon, both have been unprofessional and the replacement policy clearly needs a revision.I was unlucky as I recieved a faulty handset. After several calls between Apple cusotmer service and Amazon I realised I am duped for 70,000. Amazon won't replace unless I give them a letter from Apple and Apple won't replace anything as I purchased the phone from Amazon. I've to travel 40kms to get to a Apple store for the letter Amazon wants. They won't trust the consumer and stick to their policy which is not fair on consumers. 0 consideration shown in such unprecedented times and no room for exception. I wouldn't recommend buying phones from this seller and Amazon due to the pathetic replacement policy.

"
"

  I am honestly telling if you are willing to spend this much amount then please go and purchase from the store i received defective earphones when called amazon got rejected for service then they said they can‚Äôt do anything in it please go to service center . Do not fall into cashback traps for 2-3k rupees you can received defective default or used phones. And when you complain about this you will hear this ‚Äúhello sir sorry but we cant do anything‚Äù So please spend 2-3k and buy from store atleast you will be satisfied

"
"

  Please don‚Äôt buy iPhones from amazon they are selling defective devices & when tried for a replacement they are not accepting instead asked me to check with Apple authorised service center! The phone started malfunctioning from day 1 the camera struggles to focus the call quality is worst & finally the mic is not working! I don‚Äôt have belief in amazon on expensive items! Thank god it was under Indian warranty & thanks to Apple for replacing the phone immediately (offline) had to go direct to their centers!Don‚Äôt buy from amazon goto Apple authorised reseller!

"
"

  Good phone, but now apple is just not worth for the price you are paying. They are priced like a joke. Even the Oneplus 8 Pro is cheaper than the iPhone 11 in India, and its camera is comparable to the 1lac+ iphone 11 pro. They should start reducing their prices.

  I sell my kidney and my retina to buy this. Now it is good to see retina display without retina.

  It‚Äôs been 6months m using this device. I upgraded from 8 to 11. Here‚Äôs my short review:Camera quality: great due to dual camera sensor. Optical zoom just captures superb angles and picsBattery duration : this is the biggest advantage of this iPhone is . I don‚Äôt always carry my powerbank with me :D :D that‚Äôs the biggest relief for me ( my iphone 8 gave me headaches regarding this issue)Face sensor : this aspect needs serious improvements as I feel it‚Äôs laggy often. I prefer the hand touch sensors more.This is a pretty awesome cool iphone. Go for it as the size, performance, camera and most of the all : battery will never put you down

"
"

  Better to go with some other brand. I have Iphone 11 and I have invested approx 70,000 in this phone. I am facing issues with the charging cable which is in warranty and when I visited apple service center then they are saying it is not cover under warranty.I believe quality of Mi service Center is far better than apple service center.

"
"

  First of all idk why Amazon is charging 68k for this when I bought it it was 64,900/- which was the on box MRP. Plus, the phone is average like the camera isn‚Äôt that great as I expected it to be and it‚Äôs sad that Apple has kept most of the specs basic. The dual camera on the back is almost useless I don‚Äôt use it. I would‚Äôve gotten an XR and saved my money instead. Battery life is great, sound is amazing but price wise I think it‚Äôs too much

"

  Bought 2 iphone 11, I am.coming from one plus 7pro and s9+. I thought it would be an upgrade. Dude what a waste its same as XR, i choose both my previous phone over XR. Not gonna choose big xr again. Will wait for next iphone. I returned both iphon11 btw.

  Ive had my phone for about 2 months now and I love it. I bought it despite the fact that i have a one plus 6t.Now the first few things that are noticeably better are1. battery life - Two days solid on low power mode - best ever2. display - now hear me out. yes it might appear to be a bit washed out on the colors on the iphone...  but there is no flickering at all. if u use the lcd and go back to an oled it strains / hurts your eyes. The oled can sometimes get too vibrant and inaccurate.. even though it looks better it need not necessarily be better in all aspects. And oled's have a lower life expectancy comparatively to lcd's because of screen burn in. ive had 3 iphones in the past 4 , 6 , 7plus and all work just fine even till date!!.. but a few oled iphones (first launched in 2017)  have already started burning in.3. design , camera , performance , OS - the best - in my opinion.4. the only downside to buying this is that you get an old 5 W chagrer in the box, which is super annoying but yeah nothing unbearable. u can get an apple fast chager for about 4.5 k and be sorted AF.love the iphone 11 - thank you Apple.

  IS IPHONE WORTH IT ?let me say, it's not about iPhone or others, it was buying into a product which will be able to meet my needs and give that quality output, last year on my birthday I bought this iPhone red 128gb , which I tried multiple times buying but failed because it was always out of stock! frustrating as it was, I knew I wanted this, for the reasonI am a youtube known as WHAT THE DUDE, I make videos on men health to tech and I needed something which was handly and could should 4k! and iPhone 11 WAY ABOVE MY EXPECTATIONS,I bought it to shoot, review and make contents, and this phone has not failed me yet, I went through accidents also last year on the bike and this is durable!the battery is great, i charge once a daynow after a year when i am using youtube, Instagram, Facebook, making 1080p videos, clicking images, transferring them, all while the background apps are open i charge i every 8-10hrs, may i tell you i have not activated battery saver modethe phone is a class on its own, you can see its review on my channel and if you like you can follow me on amazon on more genuine reviewsthankyou

  Very good phone for professional and personal purpose as well. Quick as ever, faster face recognition and nice camera features.Go for it!! Battery lasts upto 1 day with a high usage.It has been 6 months I am using this phone and have not noticed anything bad so far.Dowwnside : Not future ready For 5G

  A great phone which can handle all big gaming apps very smoothly, camera is even great, battery will get a day and even many more pros as people mentioned in reviews.Single CON:Those who are upgrading to this phone who had amoled/oled phones, you will easily notice the difference in display quality.Before buying this phone go to any shop and check same youtube videos(1080, 4k,8k) comparing along with your amoled/oled phones and if you are ok then go ahead and buy.  This lcd is far better than other lcds in market but in market almost all phones have amoled/oled displays so think twice and buy(this is only for amoled/oled users)For other users blindly buy this phone

  Its been a month i have been using iphone 11. Here is my honest opinion.Pros:-Excellent battery life. I have been using samsung galaxy s9 and its battery life sucks. Iphone 11 really made me change my mind about battery life in a smartphone. Its just amazing. Easily lasts over a day of heavy usage. Just outstanding. If you want a long battery life just go for it- Excellent cameras. God damn the pics from this phone are gorgeous. Ultra wide camera is good to play with. Night mode is stunning. I would say its the best in camera department- Performance. No matter how much RAM android phones have, iphones are beast. No android phone can ever beat iphone in term of performance. Such flawless and smooth buttery performance. Just wow.Cons:-Display: it‚Äôs disappointing to be frank. Coming from an oled family, you can seriously tell difference. Its nothing compared to oled display. Very disappointed with the display.-Charger: it takes 3 hours to charge this phone from 0 to 100 and seriously its a hell lot of time. Just throw away the box charger and get a fast charger-Network: connectivity sucks in this phone. I never get more than 50 percent network coverage as comparing to samsung galaxy s9. Apple should really take this seriouslyConclusion:Its a beast of a phone. Upgrade if you are coming from lcd panel‚Äôs and want a phone with great battery and camera.If you use phone a lot and screen quality matters go for pro version. Coming from oled panel to iphone 11 would be disappointing.

  It‚Äôs been 2 months since I ordered this phone and 1month after I purchased it the phone started having issues like hang a lot often and then after few days I noticed small black dot on right side on the screen and since then it has been there and increasing since then.Touch is working at that spot but I am unable to see anything screen is black there and around it there is a orangish halo and I have no idea why

  Bought this as a gift, rear camera is DSLR quality but front camera is defective. It is clicking very dark pictures with yellow/tan tint. Reached out to Amazon and they aren't able to help, btw bought this from appario retail and again I did read some bad reviews for this seller but chose to ignore since it was iPhone. Turns out I shouldn't have, they might be shipping defective products. Now we are reaching out to Apple support to replace this, which is a big time consuming thing amid lockdown where you have to take token to visit the store. Buy it from Apple store instead.

"

  It was my first iphone and What a TERRIBLE experience!!! The mobile stopped working  after 3 weeks usage. Not getting switched on and no response to charging. Amazon service replied that the return window is closed. Apple service said they had similar complaints from mobiles purchased online and gave appointment 2 weeks later. Don't know whom to blame, the seller, Amazon or the Apple Inc. itself.  Expected better from iphone. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!And who enables the phone to have a fast charging capacity and asks us to buy the fast charging adapter separately for 1700? Who says it has dual sim and asks us to roam around to get an esim?

"
"

  It's value for money,  Build quality, design and looks of the phone is awesome.Camera performance is brilliant. Transition from Photo mode to video is marvellous. Lo light photography is speechless. Battery performance is much better and phone does not get drained out quickly. Fast charging is commendable though it doesn't come bundled with fast charger.Ninth, I am missing notification LED light.Weight of the phone is heavy. Given the price point it's really value for money and I love it.

  lucky are those who got right product because I am feeling as if i got defective one. when u r paying hefty amount and the name is so big then u don't expect any glitches. i gifted my husband this phone and see disappointment on his face everytime he use it. he was so happy with his previous phn. slow charging, bulky, problem in face recognition, not great picture quality. overall big disappointment

  I bought Apple 11 for my mom. Here's my understanding of the device:Pros:1. Battery life is really good.2. My mom is an android user. I didn't find her getting uncomfortable with the UX, so it seems they have made it pretty easy to learn, even to the pre-conditioned users.3. They have simplified camera and photography. Instead of choosing the filters during the click-time, they have kept it during the viewing time, so that appropriate filters are chosen.Cons:1. they have removed the 3.5 mm adapter. Apple is turning greedy.2. Their gestures to go to home screen is a bit confusing at first. They should simplify such things.3. Instead of informing what's new in the apps, they should tell how to use in the first run of phone. This would help users get accommodated to the device quickly.Overall, the phone is good, and has bigger screen than iPhone X (which I own). It's a bit difficult to handle from one hand, especially for the smaller sized palms, but that's how things are now.I would recommend this phone to others as well.

  The camera setup is itself a attraction and the fast and reliable faceID just steals my heart.The phone is super fast. It serves well for a whole day in one full battery charge.The iPhone 11 is an awesome piece of machine used for the day to day mobile usage. It is a beast for the android and the first love for the iPhone users.The battery is improved a lot and the camera setup is awesome.The option of different colors make it very choice of one to choose from.However I am comparing it below:-Differences from iPhone 11 pro1. Only two cameras but they serve the purpose well in 11.2. The battery is better in iPhone 11.3. The screen quality is a bit on lower side in iPhone 11.4. Processors and the charging procedure is same.5. You don‚Äôt get a fast charger with iPhone 11.Compared to iPhone XS.1. The processor is way better in 11.2. The screen quality is on lower side than XS.3. The battery life is very much improved in 11.4. Of course it is a must upgrade from XS.

"
"

  Upgraded from the iphone 10 and i can clearly see a huge difference between the display. The oled on the 10 was much better than this lcd or as apple calls it the liquid Retina display.The battery life is superbly good easily lasts an entire day for me with 5-6 hours of screen on.The cameras perform really good even in low light, the new night mode on the 11 works flawlessly, you can see a drastic difference between the picture taken with and without the night mode turned on.I really dont need to talk about the A 13 bionic because we all know apple has the best processors in the industry, the 4gb ram is more than sufficient for this beast. The phone is much faster and smoother than my galaxy s10 plus which has 8gb ram.Its a great value for money phone with an okish display and astonishing performance and superb cameras. The red colour is really eye catching and attractive. Apart from the display I didn‚Äôt see any other flaw is this phone.

"

  Waste money this time to buy 5g phones but iphone don't have 5g upgraded phones. And also price is too high for all time i suggest to iphone company please read the market value before tag a price in any iphones.

The phone has two 12MP cameras, one wide and the other ultra-wide. The wide-angle camera itself is not a new concept, but Apple‚Äôs take of a wide-angle camera is. In fact, the 120-degree field of view is packed into a 4:3 frame, which is unique and giving a whole new perspective. While if does not give the images a fish eye look, especially in landscapes, it ends up being a different way to showcase a landscape photo.The iPhone 11 is also a good handycam replacement because you can shoot 4K at 60FPS using both the lenses and this ability to switch to ultra-wide for video is seamless. I loved the fact that even with slow-motion, both the lenses come into play. The video experience on this phone is the smoothest I have seen so far and it also stays cool even after long 4K shoots.Apple iPhone 11 specifications: 6.1-inch LCD Liquid Retina HD display, 1792 x 828‚Äëpixel resolution at 326 ppi | A13 Bionic chipset | Dual 12MP Ultra Wide and Wide cameras with 2x optical zoom out; digital zoom up to 5x, Ultra Wide: ∆í/2.4 aperture and 120¬∞ field of view, Wide: ∆í/1.8 aperture | TrueDepth Camera (Front camera) 12MP camera with ∆í/2.2 aperture | Battery: One hour longer than iPhone XR | IP68 rating for dust and water resistance |

  I have a 128gb variant white. Battery life is amazing. I always leave the GPS and WiFi and Bluetooth on And i use it five hours a day on an average as per the weekly screen reports. Still the battery stays all day with at least  30 percent left.Camera quality is stunning. Surprising low light photography. Outdoor photography is stunning. Portrait mode photos are such a great experience.Face recognition is very quick.Phone never got hung or lag. I have played asphalt 9.

  Had to make choice between Oneplus 8 pro and iPhone 11. Oneplus sale is a joke. I waited but in vain. Plus once a case is put, beauty is gone. Camera was big let down in Oneplus. So I went ahead with iphone 11 and its such an amazing phone.With 5g coming somewhere by the end of 2022, this beast should stay with me till then. iOS is an amazing experience.Sound, camera, build quality, smoothness is top level.

  I had received the package with all contents, phone turned on as expected and works for setting up.The sim card slot refuses to open! Appario Retail is supposed to be well established, this is a pathetic handling of the package and absolutely unacceptable.There is no refund / return policy as well Need to contact an official repair center to get it fixed. 65k down the drain.Disgusted at the mishandling of the product

  ¬†Simply just awesome bundlepacked features , 12 mp front camera , dual lens dual camera ios setup for back camera is just perfect , wide camera lense is worthy compare to missing telephoto , who need to zoom pics when taking it from near , I never zoom photos , telephoto is just for zoom the pics , 11 vs 11 pro , expect screen and camera everything is same , I like 11 much cause it's cheap then pro but not so cheap  as still it's costly thn many flagship and flagship killer , battery is perfect , phone screen is gr8 , viewing angles are better , camera is cherry on cake , first time I found a complete iphone ,

  We bought iPhone11 Green 128GB. It had a manufacturing defect (thin visible opening between back glass and aluminium band). This was sold at slightly reduced price as renewed(which means any minor bugs fixed and certified by technician) but a major Hardware defect was still present[Thin opening in between glass panel and body. It won‚Äôt pass the water resistant test as claimed by Apple]. Glad we could identify it. Even the new phones that you‚Äôre buying might have such small unnoticeable defects. Please double check your phone soon after arrival. If possible in front of the delivery person itself. And about RENEWED phones, PLEASE STAY AWAY!! DO NOT FALL FOR THE DISCOUNT TRAP!!!

  I bought it from the Apple store.Its a good phone with good features. Only issue I faced is of heating. It get heated up too soon. Although its summer time and I always have the uses of 14 hours a day so it is a genuine issue.Well talking about the battery life it needs to be charged twice a day as it is having battery issue as we all know. Apple isn‚Äôt that good in battery things.I would suggest to go for 128gb segment as 64gn won‚Äôt be helpful.Don‚Äôt buy it from Amazon. These sellers are faking up and You will get better benefits too from the store as I got a pebblewood speaker free on the purchase.

  Purchased apple i phone , which got delivered on 19th and which developed technical glitch in receiver speaker on 20th. Since, i read that product can be replaced within 10 days , but i didnt read the policy, which says that whatever happens to i phone once its sold, Amazon and reseller s wash their hands off any responsibility that instant. Poor customer is left on apple support . I approached apple team, which suggested to ask amazon to replace handset since its brand new, but somehow, amazon turned blind as bat when it comes to take liability of selling defective products !! All this left a really bad taste. I am not going to order anything expensive again online. LESSON LEARNT!!

  When people are buying for huge price they should get excellent product but here the phone has big problem heating issue and battery drain problemEven while watching instagram stories phone started heating..Serioulsy as a apple brand they should take care of this and update in next ios...Except camera everything is same when compared to xr...Xr is good value for money...No heating issue in that it has excellent camera and battery is excellent..I have been using xr from many days it is good and i bought this 11 seriously now i am feeling unhappy..

  Waste of purchasing perticular colour, its better to go with silver... I have complained to Apple care and no one cares about this. After losing a huge amount for the specific red product n now losing its colour depressing me a lot. Apple care answered ""Colour is a colour n colour will goes off"" i know but not in just span on 2months that too without any action done by me. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHILE PURCHASING THE COLOUR ONES.

  Hi, I am writing this review after 2 months of usage of phone although i have purchased the device from Singapore but this review is about mobile not about amazon service.1) batter backup- With normal usage my batter is at 78% till evening , you can accept a full day backup with heavy usage.2)performance - its a beast, works like a charm no lags nothing.3) camera- camera is pretty good, i have attached 2 samples one of diwali diya and other of a rose , camera is so powerful, beautiful potraits but yes i would like to mention a general issue for all phone 11 it faces  flare issue when you point camera to direct source of light but i dnt think that create a much issue. Also night mode is premium feature of this phone no flash still light , its a magic.4) Sound- Sterea sound with surround effect seems to be in theater Overall its a good deal to go for .

  The iPhone 11 delivers what it promises. It‚Äôs premium, has one of the best camera in a smartphone, and is super pleasant to use.I have been using it for past 9 months, and haven‚Äôt ever faced a single issue with any of its features. The cameras remain the highlight of this phone, but even apart from the cameras, this phone offers a super reliable and premium ownership experience that is worth the price. The battery backup is decent and easily lasts a typical day of usage with videos, cameras and social media apps.The only things that could have been better are its display quality and the notch.

  The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it. The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone . Even from a small distance you can get small visual small cracks

  I placed an order for iphone-11 on  Fri (16/10, against exchange offer and all best possible offers ). But while receiving the iphone, it was undelivered to me as the Amazon app showed that exchange device did not match (due to AMAZON Bug & no miss from my end). I contacted Customer care immediately and was assured that the product would be delivered within 24/48 hrs as I am a Prime member. After few hours, the order was auto cancelled & the exact reason was not known to customer care. Meanwhile, the price of phone increased, exchange value dropped and bank discount went away, color of my choice is unavailable. I would have been content even if I could order the same phone at same price (keeping aside the trouble & waste of time I had).I was disappointed again as the CSA mentioned this was not possible and I will have to place a new order at higher price.As it was an exchange offer, I cleaned my old mobile & deleted all my data prior to handover my old mobile. I contacted the customer care executives, 4 different executives came on line & every time I had to explain the whole story for non-delivery of my iphone & none of these executives was effective to handle the problem. This is definitely not a good 'Amazon Great Indian Festival' experience to share.

"

  I got the wrong fake product where the box imei no and phone imei no is different and new phone was out if warranty and it was not an Indian product and it was locked phone.. very bad experience with Amazon...after paying so much money I got defective product and this is not nice what Amazon did...

"
"

  I also own a one plus 7T pro so it has better screen however iPhone has better handling, face recognition and better selfie and camera.Rear camera though of one plus is also very good.I am happy with the purchase. Got ‚Çπ6000 cash back with local dealer and hence didn‚Äôt buy on Amazon.Face recognition is the best I have seen.

"
"

  The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast.Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & ipad.

  I was using android since the birth of smartphones, never tried IOS and was bit sceptical about iphone because of different miths about it, customisation is the one to name some. The other reason for not purchasing iphone is the price but this time apple did a great job in pricing, it launched iphone 11 at a decent price like not too cheap but not too expensive, I won‚Äôt say it is not overpriced, indeed it is because we can get a good flagship category android phone at a much lesser price. Well lets get to the pros & cons:Pros:1. Great Camera2. Best processor in the Industry - A133. Good battery life for average user4. Secured Phone because it is IOS5.  Smooth experience overall6. Water ResistantCons:1. Battery life is not sufficient for an heavy user.2. Not a OLED screen which is must at this price, but still it doesn‚Äôt make a much difference for day to day use3. The in box charger is pathetically slow just 5watts4. The Notch is still the same size with thick bezels which makes the design a bit outdated.My final verdict will be buy this iphone only if you are already an iphone user or if you want a full proof secured phone otherwise there are plenty good options in Android industry naming Samsung Galaxy S20 & Note series.

  I purchased iPhone11 in 70k but never had disappointment with iPhone. I was the user of iPhone6s initially. My iPhone 11 is very bad in WiFi. It‚Äôs damn slow and most of the time app and Webpage won‚Äôt load. Same WiFi works fine in my other mobile and iPad also. Tried everything like format reset etc etc. called to customer care but they are not talking as issue and saying your WiFi may be slow. If WiFi is slow then how it is working fine in another mobile and iPad . Worst service from Apple. Now onward will not recommend iPhone to anyone

"
"

  Since I purchased this phone,  I was able to use it after few days but it's not working properly.Calls get failed repeatedly,  screen gets blank often and unable to switch off phone during that time . SIM is working normally,  as I checked it with other phoneWanted to return,  but as I was out of station  , unable to do so before 2nd February .What to do now? Is it still possible to return and get another set?Kindly helpHoping for prompt reply

"
"

  Guys these iphone are refub and 11 have serious heating issue ..highlly recommendation these may be used and repaired phone ...

"
"

  After using 5s for 6 years which is still working I updated to this. Loving it. Best part of apple products is that it will give you real performance, I mean why to have a camera which over exaggerates the pictures. For that we have editing software in the phone. User interface is mind blowing. I can control each and every notification unlike in high end android phones. The display is at par with most expensive android devices. Speed is much better than any high end android.

"
"

  R u guys delivering  defective piece coz I can see in comments dnt do like this .. we r paying huge money for this  .. I think Amazon getting worse day by day

"
"

  The night mode is excellent and guess there r no smartphone left that can compete the iPhone lineup

"
"

  Camera quality is awesome crisp nd clear. I am i phone user from last three years best phones ever. No heating problem.

"
"

  Fine product. Superb phone. Integration with Mac works like a charm. Integration with Apple TV not happening. Personal hotspot ops to be understood for connectivity. Contacts easily imported from Google. Downloaded movie apps work great and so does casting. Even Google home.

"
"

  Too expensive Other mobile are good under 20000Then iPhone. Only the app taking the money of Apple Symbol only.Don't buy

"
"

  An android user from the last  4 years and this is my first iPhone.  I have not found much difference in terms of interaction with the phone.  This is a premium segment phone and it performs as expected. Things are a bit smoother compared to android,  the features are quite mature and handy.I won't say ios is great or exceptional but it seems quite mature compared to android, I am sure Android will improve day by dayOne problem I noticed that the system apps are using GPS excessively. Toggling off the GPS usage for some system services improved the battery backup dramatically.If you have the budget just go for it, you won't regret.

"
"

  Mobile is very good , but first time disappointed by apple service center in raipur(c.g).I bought this phone in May -20 from Flipkart and yesterday I visit service centre for not working my earphone which provide in box .""Service center said that this phone is original but earphone is third party and they said don't buy from online, we can't do anything for this . ""Seriously n saying plz take step for this matter because maximum phone purchase from online .If service center refuss the phone by saying stupid word that can't be admitted.Phone is under warranty and they saying this stupid word .

"
"

  ¬†It's a terrific device to say the least. The phone looks very premium and upscale. It fits my hand perfectly. The A13 Bionic Chipset is lightening fast. The facial recognition works just fine. Got no complaints about it.  The Camera is one of the best in the league and the battery life is amazing. A single charge gets me through the day with 5-6 hours of Screen time. I only downside was the 5W charger. The phone supports fast charging but the company doesn't provide you with a fast charger which i think is Illogical. I don't understand what kind of cost-cutting is this. Apart from that I have no complaints.

"
"

  You Should better buy directly from apple's official website as you can get it nearly Rs. 35k and assurance of Apple's Customer care services and other benifits directly other than getting worried from a defected model which is not returnable.That's my Suggestion for all the Buyers.Every Apple product or any other brand product you woona buy go for it at its official website and infact get Cheaper rate while getting Warrenty from the Company.Have a Nice Shopping Event.

"
"

  I am typing this review from iPhone 11 itself and I loved it soo much as a student I need to use phone on daily bases like so many hours I spend on phone and this phone is the best if your a student or an entrepreneur or a human ! So go for it even I had doubts before ordering but I did anyway and I am satisfied

"
"

  the seller appario retail ltd. gives old used and defective pieces. and if you go to get replacement they(apple) dont entertain you becoz you got it from amazon. you should get apple products from apple.com . they are 4-5k costlier but atleast you know for sure that the product is new and not defective. and even when you hah\ve any issue, you can contact apple and they will help you. but if you buy from amazon, very high probability that you might get defective piece from this seller and apple wont help you much.

"
"

  ¬†Worst camera ever. I was so excited to get this phone and now I feel so disappointed. I have been using 7 and find 7 much better than 11 in terms of camera. I have uploaded the video

"
"

  With the Great Indian festival offering the 128GB Iphone 11 for close to 50K, this is an amazing value for money phone. Snappy phone with a good display, great camera and battery and the best software experience. Totally worth the buy. My Iphone XS broke down and moving to the 11, the phone did feel a bit bulky and the screen a bit outdated. But after the initial settling in period, this phone is worth every penny (for 50K).

"
"

  I WAS USING IPHONE 6S BEFORE THIS PHONE. 6S HAD VERY LOW BATTERY PERFORMANCE, POOR CAMERA  QUALITY. I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT IPHONE 11 WILL GIVE ME SUCH A WONDERFUL BATTERY BACKUP.  DO BUY IPHONE 11 IF YOU ARE LOOKING PHONE IN 2020.

"
"

  2 years back I purchased Iphone X and now 11. Such a wonderful phone I‚Äôm liking it over X. In time delivery from Amazon, nice camera, big screen, fast face id and good battery backup. Apple is apple what to say. Buttery smooth as always.Budget phone.

"
"

  Product came at a great discount and honestly the camera is awesome.....there is a reason why its the best selling smartphone...I don‚Äôt think one should buy the iphone 12 mini or anything when they are getting everything for much less (less than 22k approx ) in iPhone 11!!..its a great product and I absolutely recommend this phone to everyone...

"
"

  Apple is actually the Apple, the king of all smartphones. Best in every aspects. Redefined the words QUALITY. May not be the flagship upgrade but exceptional in every single damn way. I‚Äôm totally satisfied with this purchase.

"
"

  My first iPhone..üòçCamera quality is awesome...Ultra wide lens gives excellent pics. Moderate users can get 1 day battery life easily. IOS üòçgives a different level experience. Top notchüëå security for your data. Best value for money phone(Just OLED display, SS body frame and telephoto lens are additional features in Pro model).128 GB variant will be a better choice.Very much satisfied with Appleüòò

"
"

  Ya  he is absolutely right @suman biswas. I too experienced same complaints! Its better u not prefer amazon for  iphone. All cannot know the where abouts of whom to contact and how to contact when a problem arises. So its better not to get in to any problem. Dont opt in there its my personal advise. Thank you.

"
"

  Pricey but Best! Apple could have added a fast charging adapter in the box. Ordered and got the delivery in a day. Purple model is more of lavenderish, but looks differently awesome.

"
"

  Absolutely value for money and an essential upgrade for all old iphone users. Camera is unparalleled especially the night mode. Truly the best !!

"
"

  iPhone 11 is my dream mobile to buy. It will take a year of hard work because farmers family doesn't have that much money. But its my dream to use iphone 11. Wait iphone i will come soon.

"
"

  Don‚Äôt compare it to one plus (with Oxygen OS android 10), its not android.For an iPhone this one offers best value for buck. I moved from Android ecosystem to iOS only for privacy and security reasons.

"
"

  Camera Quality is absolutely amazing, Apple has maintained its legacy. Wonderful product.......Very satisfied with the product

"
"

  Good product ,but dont buy it from amazon ,they will provide you with defective iphones ,past experience of buying iphone on amazon didn't go well .(Had bought iphone 5s three years ago ,it used to restart every now and then ).so bought this iphone 11 offline from local apple retailers.

"
"

  One of the most budget friendly as well as best IPhone designed by Apple ever. The battery life is mind blowing the phone is fastest I have ever used(and I have used many premium phone including android and iOS) and the camera is just cherry on the top!Only down side is the display, I mean it is best LCD I have ever used but it‚Äôs still a LCD and not OLED, the worst thing about LCD is you can see blacks unlike OLED.To sum up everything for 65K it‚Äôs a bang for the money!

"
"

  Android phones like OnePlus are not bad but iPhone 11 is great because the operating system and hardware both in-house product not possible with Android phones. If money is not a problem then always buy iPhone

"
"

  Easily my best phone till date. I miss a lot of features and little things from my last android Phone but I can sacrifice anything over Camera quality,ease of use and privacy!This particular model is actually worth the money.

"
"

  I was nervous after reading these negative comments but I have recieved a quality product.Really love this device. Built quality is so premium, no heating issues totally satisfied.

"
"

  its a great phone for those who likes iphone but its litte over priced in india considering its only 54K in Dubaieven amazon is over priced like 2K higher than reliance

"
"

  One of the best. And you won't feel bad for Going for it. I switched from Android, and to be fair to myself and anybody wanting to do the same. It's too good. You'll feel some for the first few days. Camera is as always awesome. It's been a month now. Battery life is manageable. Face recognition is fast as well.In short, just go for it.

"
"

  Phone is awesome.. only camera is not that much good.. because in this price range apple is providing 12 MP camera whereas other brands provide 40 MP +  camera..Rest i Must say phone is awesome .. overall its a bundle of performance.

  The phone camera is ultimate even in night time. I have taken multiple pics in the late might. The battery backup, performance and screen quality is very nice.

"
"

  I had an upgrade from iphone 7 to this iphone 11. Got it for 65,900 (128gb) During apple days..If u are waiting for 12 but u don't have 1 lakh budget then no need to wait, just buy this..atleast you will get charger and earphones with this..nice confident color better than any other.. and more over made in India..Jai hindüáÆüá≥

"
"

  If u will use iPhone11..you will stop buying chinese phones..

"
"

  Don't buy this I have purchased it for 60 thousand for 64 gb variant on 7 August now they are selling same variant for 63 thousand

"
"

  Got this for just 44k and its just awesome!!Super value for money !And it was perfectly fine ordering form Amazon

"
"

  super awsome perfect  intellegent product of the year 2020 and much must should in your and our homes.f ourself didnot buy we will feel dull.so buy this product.

"
"

  The Camera Quality is Awesome. Very Smooth and User Friendly. Ultra Fast Face Recognition which None Other Phones Perform. The Live Photography is Extraordinary.

"
"

  I'm very fond of their products, but what to do, till now this product has not come in my hand, I request all of you to pray that I too get a chance to use their product one time. ü•∫Thank You ;-(

"
"

  Battery life is too poor for a 12 hrs use .For heavy users its complete headache to charge it over &again.Camera quality is good but not as good at this range to satisfy me.

"
"

  I'm using iPhone 7 for the last three and now upgraded to this iPhone 11 128gb model and my experience with this is just awesome. No words for the picture quality especially on portate mode. The sound quality is very crisp and clear, feels great with this cell phone. The build quality is much improvised. In the end, I just say go for this iPhone with blind eyes.

"
"

  Very disappointed from Amazon. I have put my old phone on exchange. It was bit defective I noticed at the time of delivery. I requested courier person and also called customer service that I am ready to pay the old phone exchange amount but no one considered it. Very disappointed.

"
"

  Phone is heating too much

"
"

  Phone is totally worth every penny smoothness of touch and ram mangaement and speed  is also a amazing  also dual speakers are too loud and crystal clear voice.in camera department I think no one can beat Apple specially night mode feature is extraordinary.you should go for this product you vl not regret it.

"
"

  Apple 11 excellent phone in a budget range ,camera quality, performance everything was awesome .  If you are a apple phone lover go for it üôÇ

"
"

  The best iPhone I have used. Previously used the iPhone X and changed to the iPhone 11. Must say this is a lovely design. The camera has improved drastically. And I love the wide angle! Overall a phenomenal device. Nothing to complain

"
"

  Hi am a android user from 10yrs 5days back I took iphone11,starting it was tough to Handel,but know am really love my phone,know am getting 2 know y iOS user will not use android mobiles,really worth phone price is little bit high but quality of phone is superb camera is awesome speed is also superb really worth buying

"
"

  I am totally dissatisfied by Patna service centre ""f1 infosolution"". Dnt buy apple products. For this product I can give 3.5 out of 5 and for its service I will give 0.5/5.

"
"

  Everything is good as was expected but I am not happy with the battery life  as it is only 3110mah it is expected to be aroun 5000-6000amh battery in this price range

"
"

  Hi, I purchased this phone in January 2020. Somehow due to some accident, the phone has broken down. Wanted to know if there is any sort of insurance attached to it?The phone otherwise has worked well

"
"

  No comparison of any phone .Camera performance and battery is very nice , the best iphone is 11. I‚Äôm happy to buy it

"
"

  Overall fantastic! I could say the best battery backup in the iphone series. Battery was the major issue for apple. Though iphone 11 is best in all the super fats chip in the smartphone ever, face recognition, night mode and the camera ofc everyone is aware of that. Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  It's beast and I'm totally in love with it. I really wished to own this mobile n budget is bit less now.waiting to buy this phone specially from Amazon. If u r wish to upgrade to apple, it's a right time to get this chance n enjoy the apple world. At this price, apple 11 is the best.

"
"

  Don‚Äôt think twice before getting iPhone 11, Camera is superb, if you are creative, you can get the best camera shots, amazing low light photography. Check some of my photos. Money is temporary , but memories remain permanent.

"
"

  Thanks amazon for 48 hours deliveryGot at 47k great Indian saleReally very impressive cameras with smart hdrSuper Impressive speed and smoothnessBattery does give 6 hrs of SOTTo be honest don‚Äôt judge specs when it‚Äôs apple

"
"

  Why apple sold their fast charger seperately. And why their products are so costly compared to other flagships. Oneplus is cheaper thrn its international price and apple is 2x price in india compare to international price.

"
"

  Classy phone no doubt. Only one issue- I will never buy a Made in China iPhone including the ones assembled & manufactured.. Would like to use a home made Apple brand.Better they expedite the mass Production of premium iPhone models in India

"
"

  AWESOME PHONE ..! Superb Camera.!!! Bit expensive but the quailty you got..

  Amazing phone battery backup camera and look is awsome.....only bezzels are noticable and in starting it was heating for approx 1-2 month but now there is no heating issue...Display quality is really good...afterall its a LCD display but Quality of display is really nice.....

"
"

  Manufacturing defeft....have paid a lumpsum amount for a brand ...Apple is a brand ..the best one in the world.Such defects from Aplle sent to an online purchasing customer is unacceptable.Have requested replacement to the service provider amazon.Not yet replaced by Amazon.

  This was a gift to my younger brother from my side and he is so so happy with the product. I rated 4 star bcz i thng there is always a scope to being best version of urs... Thnx

  i always prefer  apple for its high security lock and code services, this 11 is just sleek smooth and multi color variants model comes with all premium feature,like it very much

"
"

  Product is having heating issue , don't know buying this one online was a right decision or not.

"
"

  I liked the phone cuz I got it free. Me and my friend broke into the nearest izenica showroom during lockdown. Got a sackful of iPhone products. Now I am in my home which is far away from the state. The police can't even arrest me due to pendemic. üòÇüòé

"
"

  This is the best phone at this price, Love this phone very nice Phone for this budget, good battery, best camera

"
"

  I was bit worried once after placing order that the product will be genuine or not but now I can say that product is 100% genuine and speed of delivery is also best..

"
"

  I upgraded from ip7 to 11 and the transition has been so good.The phone is big but i will get used to it.Camera is the best on any other smartphone.Yellow color is best in my opinion.

"
"

  Best camera and performance.Slightly low screen quality but  will not disappoint you.I came from redmi k20pro and didn‚Äôt felt any drastic fall in screen quality.Just love this BEAST.One more thing HDR is next level.

"
"

  Quick delivery and good product at good priceIPhone at this price with quick delivery is worth it

"
"

  Apple products are always good and the camera of this iphone is too good. Every year apple launch their iphone and in every year the camera quality of their iphone is better than their previous iphone. That why the camera of iphone is too good

"
"

  The picture quality of iPhone11 is excellentAs I have not purchased it from amazon as 128gb price was 70,000 and I purchased it from my nearest store for 64000 128gb blackSo firstly check the price at your nearest apple retailer üëçüèª

  Why the camera quality is so worse

"
"

  It's my first iPhone...i was lifetime android user. Liked the colour so much....looks and feels premium in hand as it should. Camera is the best part of the phone i like.

"

  Too good .. i have a switch from i phone 6s to 11. Its not a phone .. its a beast . Just awesome. Everything good.

  Fake product. See the my displayWt a iPhone 11 colity .üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°I buy November month .March month in my display failed out üò≠

"
"

  Good at cameraGood at performance

"
"

  Best iphone that i ever have used in this range..whether its camera quality or display or addons it will mesmerise you in every corner

"
"

  Even though we are paying nearly 70k there is lot of heating issue and one more drawback is giving 5w charger which is insane after paying 70k

"
"

  I like this product but it is so costly I request apple to make a chipper phones also for those who can't afford

"
"

  Screen os bigger and better picture quality.As its size is bigger, it is less slippery and easy to hold.

"
"

  Camera  is verry good.overall good.battery life is exellent.life like photo clarity.another classy product from Apple.Overall nice

"
"

  I am writing this review after using for 15 days... i have jumped from 6 to 11 and its an awesome product...Cons only onething it would have had is finger print... it doesn‚Äôt recognise you when u wear masküòáüòáüòá

  The battery health dropped to 93% in 6 months. And if you‚Äôre a heavy gamer then the battery health will be okay for the first few months then it‚Äôll go downhill. Think before investing.  2 games of PUBG then it‚Äôs all drained out.

"
"

  I‚Äôve buyer it from apple storeGreat experienceI‚Äôm loving the iOSIt‚Äôs worth it . Go for it ...

"
"

  Amazing camera.its better than DSLR camera and battery backup is superb....attached some pics taken from iPhone11. Dual speaker producing dts effect while watching movies and listening music as well.

"
"

  Nice product very best phone battery life best and camera  good and all colity  finger print reader  good thanks amazon

"
"

  Phone is amazing . Battery last a day if used heavy. Camera performance everything is Amazing

"
"

  Dont buy anything phone from Amazon in sale ,they sell the defected or damaged inside software,i dont know why but it happened so many times with me .There is no life of any product i buyed from Amazon in offer.

"
"

  Powerpacked Performance..it will never leave u in splits for purchasing it.Camera is next level n U will love it ‚ô•Ô∏èüëçAfter 13.4 IOS update face recognition even recognizes ur mask worn face.

"
"

  I was using note 9, switched to iphone 11, when i started using i feel great and felt pampered. call clarity browising speed and security with dual sim is great.

"
"

  Best phone that i every had still now playing pubg is this there no lag smooth performance camera quality is also good enrich with color quality of display is very good .

"
"

  Everything is perfect. You won‚Äôt regret buying this product. Even the display is better than most android phones.

"
"

  Phone is very nice features camera battery life everything is nice the only problem us back glass is very weak so just be careful

"
"

  It is so beautiful , can't take my eyes off it. Camera quality is awesome. Battery is strong. It is running smoothly and there's no lagging.It's worth for money. Go for it.

"
"

  Money wasteThey are not replacing phone they told me that apple care will manage this issue we cant do anything.Apple care decide to take your phoneIf apple care approve you will get replacement.

"
"

  Camera quality very good.Battery backup also good but not very good.Display is slow in comparison to my honor 9N mobile but very smooth of iphone 11.

"
"

  After reading all the reviews I have cancelled my order it's really poor don't go for Amazon products on especially on iPhone products really very bad experience so I cancelled my order

"
"

  I bought it during the big festival sale thank you amazon for the faster delivery and the phone is awesome highly recommend definitely will give review after few months of use

"
"

  Real nice phone I had used ever

"
"

  Everything is good . I‚Äôm using it from past one month now after the update phone sound is not working

"
"

  It‚Äôs a very nice phone. You should buy it. Battery life is for 1 or 2 days unlike the other previous iPhones whose batteries would be drained in 2-3 hours. Camera quality is also good.

"
"

  Wish to thank Amazon for a safe and quick delivery . Phone as usual very smart with bigger screen.Big thanks again.

"
"

  Perfect phone for the people who love iphone family. Sad part is it charges very slow. You have to buy a fast charger additionally

"
"

  Excellent camera and face recognition rear camera is excellent everyone should buy in this range

"
"

  Best quality in terms of battery life camera and storage

"
"

  Bad battery life

"
"

  Phone is good but Amazon has fooled us in July I bought this phone for 70000 in emi now they are giving the same phone for 53000 within 2 months I lost 17000

"
"

  This apple has already been eaten by someone else,very bad behaviour.Huh. Not expected from Amazon.Not value for money.

"
"

  Nice quality and timely delivery, camera also good enoughGift wrap is not good enough. Should improve gift wrapping quality.

"
"

  Binod.

"
"

  Need a replacement charging is super slow. There is some issue with the charger.

"
"

  A defective piece do not buy from seller and amazon waster service incompetent executives.Do Not But From Amazon Bunch of cowards who purely lie

"
"

  Not at all happy with the product and service..No value given to the money I spent

"
"

  Choose black and change cases

"
"

  Lcd screen in 65k ,what ever apper say its retina display or great diaplay but its a lcd diaplay ,some timea screen look yellow ,thats why i sold my phone after 15 day use .APPLE MAKING FOOL PEOPLE

"
"

"
"

  Its a blazing fast phone but if your are very heavy user (10hrs daily) then battery is not enough. Its the best iPhone till date at this price

  I have switched from iPhone 8plus to iPhone 11 and I must say I am really impressed and speechless I can't ask more than this.1 - Best Lcd you won't disappoint  I am myself product designer and pixel pepper display plays a very important role but am really impressed with this display.2 - Size of the phone is perfect not to big not to small and I am guessing loads people may be concerned about that big bezel or notch compare to iPhone 11 pro or 11 pro max after using for a while you don't even realize about that.3 - Everythings looks so good in this phone using the app in this phone is a completely different experience if you come up from old iPhone with big bezels4- Face ID is just one of the best features. Loads people still cry about touch id not there but they are so wrong.Face ID is so fast and so cool I am just loving it.5- Camera Kills all the flagship android phone. What amazing photos you can click with this phone night mode is the rockstar.So Bottomline whoever is thinking to buy this phone just go for it you won't regret

  I was android used moved from pixel 2xl to iPhone 11 as per my budget.Its been more than 1 week I‚Äôm using this as a my daily driver smartphone.Whats i noticed here is:1. Overall its a good phone but screen display is not oled or amoled so it doesn‚Äôt feel premium display. Even my pixel2xl display is better than this.2. Battery backup is also average its same like my pixel 2xl phone.3. Performance and speed is so good.4. Software experience is very nice but ui customisation is limitation. My pixel win here.5. Great camera little bit better camera as compare to my pixel phone but pixel is 3-4 year old phone. Still great camera it has.6. I bought this phone because I wanna experience ios os features.7. Designs is ok but not so wow kind of in this 2020.8. Hardware quality is premium.9. Overpriced smartphone I personally think.10. I feeling looted because i have so much better options in android less than 60k price.11. Display does matter so i will suggest don‚Äôt buy this phone go for Oneplus or samsung.12. Faceid is useless sometimes in night or some place its not working properly everytime showing face at some angle is freaking process. Why they aren‚Äôt providing touchid side by side like android phone.13. I‚Äôm happy with this phone quality but not happy with this 60k price point.I personally feel this phone isn‚Äôt a 2020 generation phone guys.Because we have full screen and best display with 90hz refresh rate with less tha 60k price point so why u wanna buy this phone only for chipset and camera and nothing else.I will suggest don‚Äôt buy this phone its not 2020 generation phone.

  +ve:BatteryPerformanceFaceLock-veDisplay (Its not AMOLED but its okay)Only 5GB cloud space free. (I believe in android it had 15 GB you can move to google photos or one drive as an alternative measure)Consider before Buying:No Finger Print SensorInbox charger is 5W ( But phone supports 18W)Charger Cable Quality (Not worse but could be better)Dual Sim (ESIM + Normal Physical Sim) --> ESIM is not available in BSNL other network has.PUBG with high settings causes heat on the phone. ( Its normal however the battery is good when compared to android)All application sizes will be very huge when compared to Android. (might be 10x than android so plan ur capacity need)Buy Temper glass & Case while purchasing or before using the phone to avoid scratches.Issue with seller:The IMEI doesnt matches with the bill they have provided I am yet to get the update from AmazonOut of 2 IMEI one matches and the other doesnt matches.

  I had an iphone plus and wanted to upgrade. Did consider Oneplus 8 pro, Galaxy s20 etc.. But then, I don't need all the fancy these phones offer. I never play any games and hardly watch high resol videos. So, my priority were and what this phone offered,- Good Call quality- Decent Battery life- Fast Charging (fed up of iphone 7 plus slow charging). Buy separate adaptor and charging is fast and good. Out of the box adaptor can go directly to dustbin- Durability - i plan to keep this for next 3 years at least. My iphone 5s is still a solid backup phone, which is 6+ yrs old- Big enough to have a good read of news, watsapp etc- Decent enough display. I don't watch movies etc on phone. Good enough for normal use- Decent camera - i am more of DSLR guy, hardly use mobile. But camera on these are exceptionally good. You can refer some youtube video.So, Iphone 11 has all this and more than enough for my daily needs. i don't miss extravagant display etc, may differ user to user. Secondly, I have Mac, so its better mix with smooth airdrop etc.If you are ardiant apple user, i don't think you will like Android interface overall, no matter how fancy they are. I have used and got back to iOS.

"

  They boasted about photos quality in the night which is horrible when compared to one plus.Wide photos are really useless because the pic is curved.Video quality is horrible when compared to One plus.Also the picture quality is horrible compared to one plus 6TFinally, it is a phone for middle class people who r obsessed with apple brand but cannot afford one.I would suggest people to use money wisely and skip this apple product. I would like to get rid of mine but I spent whopping price on this garbage.

  Been a few weeks since I got the phone, coming from a Galaxy S10, only reason I had to switch was giving my phone away to someone else in the family, and every other Androids gotten awfully boring decided to give iPhones a shot after a long time and I don't think I will be switching back any time soon. If you come from a similar android flagship there are a few things you need to get used to, in terms of the software its snappy not as fast as some androids but it feels smooth and has a flow to it.Display is where you might get disappointed with but don't worry its not as bad as they say, its bright its got ample clarity and if you pixel peep you will see a few pixels here and there but nothing that will disappoint you but its brighter for some reason iOS has a very clean color palette which gives it a nice vibrant interface, watching video is alright but you will sure miss the deep blacks if you come from OLED but the dolby vision certification sure makes up for it.Battery is downright impressive I can go through a whole day without putting it on charge and still finish with more than 40 percent juice left and I often get close to 9 hours average in screen on time as well I even left the phone unattended for 8 hours and it only drained one percent and still went through the whole day without a hiccup.Camera is one of the best at what it does though Pixels and Galaxies might take slightly better pictures but if you use Instagram or Snapchat a lot this phone will do wonders for you miles ahead of any other android in terms of social media performance.There is a certain heft to the phone the S10 feels like paper and walking or holding this phone feels like a chore if you also have one of those fat spigen cases on but you will get used to it. I will suggest you put a case on this bad boy as it does tend to get scuffed around the edges my friends iPhone had the same problem.I dont have an Apple Ecosystem per se, but i got Airplay on my TV so I can stream my Apple Music library to it and play it over the sound system you can also do spotify.For someone who is coming from Android since a long time this phone is the cake, absolutely delight to use small things do make a difference and also no auxiliary or usb c so carry around a spare lighting cable around with you and also charging by default is at 5 watts you could use a fast charger to get it upto 18, though I havent found the charging slow maybe because I dont use it while it does charge.The notch is there but most of the action happens below it so its fine and you will start to ignore it after an hour.PS: lot of negative reviews for the seller but what I got was a phone fresh from the factory in her wraps and only had one wifi calling glitch which was my fault apart from that the phones been absolutely stellar and Amazons been great delivering it in the pandemic too

  Excellent example of fantabulous craftmanship! Simply loved it. Purple colour is ro die for!! Display is gorgeous. Although i was skeptical about display before buying due to LCD and comparison to OLEDs on Pro series of iphones. But trust me, you cant go wrong with this beauty. I was using iphone X one year back, th3n switched to Samsung S9+ and again came back to ios. Right now I am having both S9+and iphone 11 and when I compare both displays side by side, iphone 11's display never disappoint me in any way and give tough competition through its liquid retuna display to suoer amoled of Samung!! A must buy for iPhone lovers. Sound is also too good.

  Honest review- I upgraded from one plus three and after much contemplation and money calculation I bought iphone11 for a discounted price.. now coming to the reviewCameraAwesome, few new features where you can change the background light is impeccable but having said that if you zoom the pix they appear a bit grainy.BatteryFor normal Facebook Watsapp news usage it will last you a day but the charger is not a fast charging one which is a big big let down...having spent so much you expect fast charging atleast.. had to buy a new fast charger you know one plus 3 kind of makes you nostalgic abt this particulr featureProcessor- is ok.. for a layman like me u wouldn‚Äôt feel the difference between An iPhone processor or a snapdragon 865+. So it‚Äôs fine haven‚Äôt played games so can‚Äôt complain or commentFor making the best use of this phone you should have AirPods since they give u iPhone specific connector type earphones which is fine but you just can‚Äôt pick any 3.55 mm jack earphone and use it. This phone makes you work hard.. like u want to use the watch app but you need to get one!!! üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...TouchI think my one plus does well farely  better than iPhone 11It‚Äôs little hard to navigate maybe after sometime I get hang of itI would say with these features it should cost around30-40k.And I do t know why ppl praise it so much I think the guilt of having spent so much eggs them to say and write positive things only.All in all for all the android users you re not losing out on anything major, you are better off without an iPhone!I am still using my one plus 3

  ¬†To the first time buyers, I like to explain some myths.1..... android has 64MP camera So it is superior than apple's flagship ones---Totally Misleading.2..... Android has 8GB/10GB of RAM so it is faster --- Trust me this combination of hardware and software of apple smokes every flagship out there3.. Display myth ... has 120Hz/140Hz displayBasically Some Android phones cannot be optimised performanceSo they tricked people and changed their displayTo show a smoother experience On UI only--Not in case of appleThey've optimized iOS to the next levelIt feels more smoother In every single appSoPerformance in real world and on paper differs alotAndroids may look better on paper Or in paid YouTube videosButAre Not even close to thisA13 Bionic is way more superiorSo Prefer quality over quantityI'mUsing Apple Devices since 2013Apple is Never disappointingGot it  @59900 (prime day sale)And it impressed me alotEverything is best in classNightmode is superbIf you want overall best quality in 60-70kGo blindly with thisIt's amazingBattery backup is enough

  There is always WiFi problem. Its WiFi signal catching ability is very low and unstatic. Therefore, it is useless for me. Apple authorized service centre, without checking my phone, told me that every WiFi connection has its own strength. My WiFi works good in my OnePlus 7 Pro. I had complained it on the very 1st day of its delivery to me. Amazon asked me to visit Apple Authorized Service Centre. But there is no help either from Amazon or Apple Authorized Service Centre. It is also slow as compared to my OnePlus 7 Pro.

"
"

  It‚Äôs absolute beauty. If you‚Äôre in doubt about the display, believe me (for someone who‚Äôs coming from an android oneplus 5)don‚Äôt hesitate at all. It has a very good display. Now don‚Äôt go into the numbers.Also, it has a mind blowing cameras and it'll win your heart. Ultra wide is more useful but it comes down to personal preference and the front camera is also great.You‚Äôll love the experience.11pro is a great phone no doubt but 11 and 11pro has slim differences really. And it surely isn‚Äôt worth the 35k difference for the better screen,extra camera and the fast charger in the box.(Both 11 and 11pro support fast charging).ConsIt‚Äôs just that you can‚Äôt transfer whatsapp backup from android onto your ios.

"
"

  Extremely poor customer support! Despite repeated attempts, unable to get Apple customer care or Amazon to respond for returning/exchanging the phone. The phone is slow and heating up within a day of receiving it. The wait on the phone is endless to get on call with any Apple executive. Extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with Amazon and Apple's customer service.

  Was hardcore into android with rooting and all , moved to iPhone three years ago with iPhone 7 , and I no longer see spec sheets cause the performance is always at par with Apple  , with frequent updates you can literally use it for years , switched to iPhone 11 and trust me the screen is really good , I know it‚Äôs only HD screen but trust me it won‚Äôt make drastic difference, besides lcd screens have better life than amoled as per me , amoled screens tend to have burn in issues over the time , with latest processor and great camera this is definitely great phone , plus it has dual sim (e-sim) it has come very handy to me during foreign trips as most radio frequencies are supported by Apple

  I am moving from iphone 8 to iphone 11 and its a worthy upgrade. Even though my iphone 8 is still good and fast, I love using my iphone 11. Its a 85% iphone 11 pro at 65% of the price. So, in apple terms it is value for money.The good:- Fast processor! Same as iphone 11 pro/pro max- Awesome camera's (Again same as iphone 11pro and pro max except for the telephoto lens which can zoom 2x). Captures amazing low light pics. Ultra wide pics are good too! Best video camera ever in a phone.- Great battery backup. Lasts me a day. 1 hr gaming. A lot of browsing and chatting and some location tracking and still 15% at EOD.- iOS 13 is now mature and awesome to use. moved seamlessly from my iphone 8.The not so good:- Screen. Well its not an OLED! But still decent enough. Decent to look at. You wont feel its bad but its not great!- Front camera is average. Doesnt have a night mode. And the images are decent but not great again. Front wide angle is a joke.- 5W charger in box! Apple, I cannot hate you enough for this. You sell a 70k rs phone and give us a slow charger.What iphone 11 pro/pro max have but this doesnt?- OLED Screen (if you a fan of amazing to look at screens. I dont miss it)- Telephoto lens (Again I dont miss it ever! I mean how often would you require a 2x zoom? Its not like a 5x optical)- Metallic side body (In a cover you dont need a metallic body and I drop my phones so often that they are always protected in a cover)- Fast charger in box. I bought it online separately(HATE YOU APPLE FOR THIS)- Thats it!!!I cant see why most people would go for pro models! There is hardly any value addition and unless you have a lot of spare money, iphone 11 can everything what and iphone 11 pro/pro max can do!

  My rating for iPhone 111- Screen 4/5 - having good quality LCD screen with less PPI but no where compared to modern high PPI amoled panels.2- Camera- 5/5 -  just great.3- Built quality 5/54- Call/ voice -5/5- no issue at all.5- Face id- 3.5/5 -  no where compared to physical finger print reader, 20% times it fails to recognize your face and unlock process is itself not so smooth as you have to tap screen then swipe up to unlock where as for finger print reader just tap on reader and it unlocks the phone instantaneously. During Covid time, wearing mask and unlocking phone is so much pain as every time you have to remove your mask to get the face id work.6- Battery/ charging- 4.5/5 - battery is good, giving me 1 full  day backup in moderate use with more than 6 hr. SOT.7- Charging- 2/5 - it is weird that this 65K mobile supports fast charging but Apple is not giving 18W charger in the box, charging process is so slow and it takes like 3 hr to full charge with given charger, I use my ipad's 10W charger and it takes like 1.5 hr to full charge.6- Software- 4.5/5, iOS is smooth and using it is very pleasing experience but if you are switching from Android you will find some restrictions like can't direct trasfer files/photo/music/ videos via USB. Also I am missing call recording, duel app support and a physical finger print reader. Due to notch top status bar area is very limited, it would be great if we can see battery percentage and data speed in status bar.----overall It is a great phone but my advice is that  think twice before buying this expensive phone, as Amazon is no longer accepting return request.----

  Like:BuiltCamera : better than previous iPhonesOS: great comfortable to useBattery life : I charge it once in 2 days. (Not watching digital streaming content on phone)Dislike:Fast charging is good, still needs catching up with likes of android Samsung galaxy and notes

"
"

  An upgrate from iPhone 7 to iPhone 11 for me. Bought the black color 128 GB version. So far so good. Speaker phone volume is very loud, which is nice. Speaker music volume, may be lil feeble than its counterparts from other phone companies. Camera - best quality pictures, beats majorly all its competitors by great margin. The only DRAWBACK is its size post screen guard n phone cover - looks like a monster phone or a mini version of an iPad.

  Camera is superb for videographyGood for photography alsoProcessor: unbeatable performanceBattery: it may compromise if kit including a fast charger. Only 5w adapter will get üòëüòëüòëNetwork: is average performance ü•¥Sometimes need to set flight modeIos: awesomePrice for value: iphone is iphone üî•

"

  ¬†For me It‚Äôs a major transition from a oneplus user to an iPhone 11.. the camera is the major highlight.. added night Pic‚Äôs in the review.. it‚Äôs magical.. with little more then moderate use it easily survives for a day.. only con is charging.. that‚Äôs a bit slow.. single hand user friendly.. and it‚Äôs an iPhone so secured OS..!! Quick fast easy simple to use..!!

  I switched back to iOS from Android after a lot of hesitation. I must say I am not disappointed and I am happy.While I understand apple restricts from a lot of things but then one must know and accept it before going for apple products.Technically it is certainly on the top. Camera quality is great, no lags, great design, battery life is very good and great build quality.I am a happy customer!

"
"

  MRP of this 128GB model is Rs69900. Sellers has not mentioned this. Good thing is that this is Made in India iPhone

  I really like the performance while playing games, while shooting 4k videos, and the battery life. While the camera may be the best on a smartphone, sometimes i do prefer to use my professional camera, but for every other task, it is good.The video stabilisation is also the best on a smartphone but not quite on the same level as panasonic cameras.The screen, well i cant really tell any difference between this and a 1080 or 1440p screen, it's really good. The bezels on the side do stand out though (not bothered by the notch, that's functional),If you zoom out to the ultrawide while shooting videos, you do lose the good stabilisation.Overall it's a great product, it has the best processor, sufficient RAM that you won't notice, and it being an apple product will keep getting updates for a long time, making it a long lasting phone, the camera is the best in a smartphone and you will be happy using it. When you buy an apple product you pay for the software developments and updates that come with itEdit after 4 months: battery maximum capacity still at 100%, brightness might feel less in direct sunlight, I'm a heavy user but my phone lasts a whole day. If i go for an outing with photography or likewise in mind, I never have to worry about battery doing. Heavy apps like Lightroom do drain the battery somewhat.

  I used to hate Apple as I was an android user, a hardcore one intact. I had a Oneplus 3T. I used to think specs are the ultimate factor in a phone. I was mistaken. Though this phone has an LCD display below 1080p, it is gorgeous. You won‚Äôt notice and flaws or pixels. Apple deserves credit for this.Coming to the camera quality, OMG! The best smartphone camera, period. Video is buttery smooth! The battery life is also amazing.I‚Äôm not giving a 5 star just for the camera or the screen or for its amazing battery life.The game changer for me is iOS! Switching from android to iOS was hassle free and the operating system keeps on surprising me. It‚Äôs an experience and will leave you with a smile on your face. Delight, surprise, love and connection. That‚Äôs what Apple makes you feel.

"
"

  I am a first time Iphone user and I must say its an impressive product.If you are moving from Android you will miss some aspects of Android related to the ease of customising the look and feel of your homescreen but even then this is a phone that you wont be disappointed with.Great camera and excellent battery perfomance are the highlight of the phone.

  The phone is used phone since some body's is already used it and the mail is set

  Good packing and received a brand new product only. Delighted with the white colour iPhone, looks a sort of creamy or marble. Though initially I was little hesitant to purchase this product online, the best offers tempted me to purchase. I got 128 gb variant for Rs.51,000 after various discounts then traded my present phone for around Rs.9000 separately. So the final purchasing price of mine was only Rs. 42,000 which is highly value for money. I‚Äôm curious why Appario Retail seller getting more negative reviews as I received mine in perfect condition. This is my 3rd apple product purchase with Amazon and I hope to associate with them in future. Amazon never disappoints their customers be it low cost to any premium products. Overall satisfied with the purchase!!

  Phone as such was fantastic. Excellent battery life on mediocre usage takes two days to come down to 10%. Very good camera quality.But the phone delivered to me was faulty. The mic on the bottom was not working properly. The opponent caller can‚Äôt hear the voice clearly. But Apple support guided on the problem and visited the service centre to get it rectified perfectly without any additional cost. Now everything is fine.

"
"

  Apple is only known for brand nothing. I don't know what is the reason they are not including fast charger I bought this phone at 65000 but they cannot include a charger 2 charger I hate this if you listening Apple then please include a good charger and then reduce the price

"
"

  I am pleasantly surprised by its battery life. Once fully charged, i didn't feel any need to recharge it again in a day. The iphone 11 as a whole package is really good. I have been an android user and switching to iphone didn‚Äôt disappoint me. As far as iphone camera is concerned, i found it a bit less effective /good than google pixel camera . Google pixel camera was outstandingBut Nevertheless, a good buy

"
"

  Very bulky. So bulky my fingers hurt while i use the phone.A13 Bionic chip is a monster.Day light photography unmatched to any device.Sometimes camera app gets confused.Night time camera is pathetic.Camera controls when night mode activates automatically is arghhhh..

"
"

  Been using an iPhone 7 since 3 years, so I upgraded to 11 when it came. This pricing of iPhone 11 and the 6000 discount by HDFC makes it a really good buy. Other discounts included, I got it at ~57K which is a great price considering a flagship Android still costs around 40K to 50K. And camera of this iPhone is a work of art. It is smooth, captures great colours, works with vivid detail. Overall, this was a good experience!

"
"

  Iphone at its bestGot the 128gb variant of iphone 11 at great indian festival sale of amazon at 50k.The best price for the product!Hreat service by amazon and the iphone is flawless, piece of brilliant make!!Fell in love with the product green color.A13 Bionic is awesome, everything is buttery smooth.The best battery life (iphone 12 has similar on paper), all day battery with average screen on time of 6+ hours on single charge.Camera is awesome although the night sight works on main camera only, not on the ultra wide camera, but as expected the camera is on par with pixel & video is better than any smartphone camera(better than some DSLRs too).At this price its a steal!

"
"

  I‚Äôve been using Android smartphones since past 8 yrs and this was my first iPhone.-This is the best smartphone I have used till now.-Camera quality, Performance, build quality is much better as compared to other Android phones in this price segment. üëç-Battery and software optimisation is amazing.‚úåÔ∏èI don‚Äôt think I will ever switch to Android again.üòéThanks to Amazon for one day delivery and Apple for manufacturing such amazing smartphone. üòä

"
"

  Apple should start manufacturing their products in India else people will stop buying Chinese products.This phone is very costly but great product. If it was produced in India then price would have been much less.

"
"

  A bit lagging at times, but it would be solved after a few updates. I got an Assembled in India üáÆüá≥ Product. Thank you Amazon for delivering the package üì¶ securely.I would update my review after using the device for six months.

"
"

  Given its my 5 th iphone, I expect better quality from apple but 11 pro camera arent as good as my 8+ i dont know why this is but leaving this an iphone is must have if u want smooth platform n interface! High performance guaranteed. Used 11 pro for 9 months now n except camera every thingvis better then previous phones.

"
"

  Great performance, good battery life, syncs perfectly with other Apple devices, and takes great pictures. Just a year old, and seems to be the best value for money spent on any iphone currently available. Looks impressive - glass back and 99% screen coverage. There is nothing that an Apple user can complain about.

"
"

  It‚Äôs taking more than 3 hours to charge mobile fully with its own charger.

"
"

  The phone is the best in its class and has the best hardware. The waterproof ability is very helpful in today‚Äôs time as the phone can be washed under running water. The camera is great, voice quality, mic speakers and display are excellent. Now the prices are also about right and hence it makes it a great deal to buy.

"
"

  Hi, iphone 11 Performance, battery life are excellent & the night mode is the bestest and much awaited feature in iphone.Charger is still the old oneRest it‚Äôs the complete phoneThanks

"
"

  It is an iPhone and lives up to the Brand and associated hype. My teenage daughter used the previous 6s for 5 years!  The item was in perfect working order and was a fresh unused piece. warranty was not activated previously. The seller was Appario so felt safer. Picked one for 59K during a price drop.

"
"

  This is my 7th iPhone since 2009 and each purchase really amazes me. The quality and the ease of use - this is something we cant get from any other mobile manufacturer. Even though the customer care is a bit of let down, i would say the product quality is quite good so you seldom need any customer support.

"
"

  It‚Äôs been more than 1 month being IPhone11 user. To be frank, it‚Äôs a mind blowing experience of premium level. Looks, performance and battery life  are the best as far as iPhone concerned. I‚Äôm a moderate user so battery easily lasts entire day even spare with 30 to 40%. I found one cons that is video call, battery get drain bit faster than android phones and signal quality is not up to the mark  but  once it get connected it won‚Äôt release the strength So it‚Äôs not a major issue. And cameras, just fall in love. Face unlocked in any light conditions. The biggest con is charging adopter 5w since iPhone 11 is beast of the mobile world but don‚Äôt know why apple still not boxed 12w or above adopter. Finally my verdict is it‚Äôs a BEAST. Go for it.Thanks for Apple and Amazon.

"
"

  Switching from Andriod to iOS is a big change. Andriod provides lot of features but your privacy is big concern . What you serach on google appears on facebook and other apps. Whatever you do all other app knows. Now, with iphone no such issues. Its faster than my previous phone OP5T. Looks premium has awesome camera. But overpriced.

"
"

  Everything is good with this iPhone. Only one this disappointed me that there is no lighting connector inside the box while it is mentioned on the box. I didn‚Äôt return or replace this iPhone because it is not a big thing but it should be inside the box as mentioned

"
"

  Phone is a bit too big, I am not a great fan of large phones. Screen touch is smooth. Smoother than my other iPhones. Full screen is definitely helpful. Face recognition works like a charm, just look at the phone and it unlocks. Reads your eyes and facial features. Double click on the power button is a bit annoying to process payments.

"
"

  The phone is super quick, is intuitive to use, has good cameras and the battery easily lasts a day.The only grouse I have is the screen. While many may not have felt it, I surely felt shortchanged. I switched from a Samsung S10e to iphone 11. The s10e had a beautiful Oled screen, some notches above this one. Just couldn‚Äôt digest a mediocre screen on a phone that costs more than 60k.I was also able to compare the camera with that of the S10e, and the results were mixed. It took better selfie and portrait pics, but fell little short in rear camera pics. No doubt, it has a very good camera system but definitely doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype of ‚Äòthe best camera ever on a smartphone‚Äô.

"
"

  I bought this as my 6S had a deteriorated battery life. I found this phone to be so power-hungry that I have to keep my phone on battery saving mode and also keep location off to get through 24 hours without calls and videos. Extremely disappointed with 11.

"
"

  Recieved this on time.  OTP verification and code on packaging is good measure to ensure security and avoid tampering.Quality is brilliant.  Impressed with the Battery Life.  Red color case is unique.  Wasn‚Äôt available locally in the market

"
"

  I actually was kind of scared of ordering an iphone online, as i saw so many reviews quoting battery problems and heating issues, but as usual amazon didn‚Äôt disappoint me. The phone is working flawlessly. The packaging was great. No issues observed.

"
"

  Disappointed with the seller. No earpods in the box. These sellers thinks people are dumb and will not read what they are paying for.It is clearly mentioned in the description that phone will come with earpods and dash charger.Replacement filed, hope will get what is mentioned.

"
"

  After one week it doesn't work.

"
"

  from the second day i had issues with the sensor  i had to change temper glass atleast 5 times in a week  and now am using the phone without the glass..better to buy in a store near you for these kinds of sensitive products

  My first iPhone after using Nokia symbian and  android for last decade or more. Impressive interface,camera,Siri, build quality, sound quality,screen quality,face  detection ...everything awesome and above Samsung Note , Oppo etc.

"
"

  Phone is good camera, great facial recognition. Ease of use and switching data between apple phones is great. At such less price, iphone 11 is great product. Just the screen is a lcd one.

"
"

  Camera is working good. Taken better quality pics. Please don‚Äôt compare with other devices. iPhone is better performance with iconic operating systems iOS. Battery life is also good. Face recognition is excellent.

  I have black. Ordered purple for wife. Was excited.  Bought in June. Just in 3 months see whats happend. Guys do not buy iphone models with fancy colors like red purpule etc.

  3 months in, love the phone. Battery lasts really well. The dual speakers are awesome. The screen is brilliant. Love the new features.

  Writing review after using for a month... Battery life is not bad .. lasts for 1.5 days ... I am not video game lover though... look is amazing... no heating issue... overall it is awesome

  Just a good phone. Very good upgrade to iphone 6 7 or 8. Bigger than 11 pro. Camera function is good for daily use.

"

  The best iPhone in terms of cost, camera, performance and battery.

  I love it. Buying this has been one of the best decisions i have made in life. The picture quality is too good just wished it came with fast changer

  Switched from galaxy s8. Display is great and awesome than s8's quad hd which I wasn't expecting. It's truly a beautiful beast

  Value for money.I buy in 59k. So it's worth it. Personally I said if you have more money then go for 128 Gb

"

  Awesome performance it is just one month I am using it will review after 6 month

"
"

  Received nicely

"
"

  Face recognition and all other features are great as expected in an Apple Product.

"
"

  The phone is awsome but we have lot of android devices around so it is not fully compatible with all the devices

"
"

  A bit bulkier and thicker than previous iphones ,but the phone is awesome. Really living up to their reputation.

"
"

  Upgrade from iPhone 7. Love it.

"

  No fingerprint. During covid, with mask on, face scanner serves no purpose whatsoever.

  Awesome Phone as usual. Yet again Outstanding product.

  I am in love with this. Go ahead without thinking much but only if you have budget to buy otherwise you can go for oneplus too.

  After using iPhone 11 for about a month, I am writing this review. So please read.When you are on shopping for a premium phone, you should look for a few important things, especially spending so much money on a device.1. The brand value. Ultimately you should be proud to take your phone out in between a crowd2. Super features. especially the camera3. Beautiful looks.All of the above are satisfied with this phone. And there is no reason one should not buy this phone. Not convinced? Read on my full review.=== Camera ===I used Samsung S series since S2 and switched to Note series since Note 5 till Note 9. So this time I switched the brand and I don't regret. Compare to my Note 9 cameras, iPhone 11 cameras are far superior in terms of taking selfies or regular photos. Just point your subject and instantly focuses on the subject and the background will be blurred like the pro-grade camera. My friends don't believe that the photos taken are on a phone and not DSLR. That itself says all.=== Screen ===Not a super sensitive screen like the super awesome AMOLED one on my Note 9, but it doesn't fall behind as well. The screen is super responsive and shows the colors accurately. However, it feels smaller compared to my Note 9 screen or even iPhone 11 Pro. I don't say this screen is the ultimate screen but is very good at this price point. If you want an ultimate screen, go for the iPhone 11 Pro which has OLED screen.=== Software ===This is the pain point. After using Android for so many years, you will feel very inconvenient with iOS. But once you started using it, you will find it easy. Just a word of caution: If you are using Whatsapp, you will lose all your existing chats and data. There is no way to migrate your data from Android to iPhone. The only possible way is buying third party software which costs $20 dollars and that too does not work 100% correct. So be prepared to lose your WhatsApp data before migration.=== App Ecosystem ===Nothing to complain here. Everything available on Android is also there on iOS and to be frank more than Android. So this is one of the plus points. But the minus point is - all iOS developers want to milk money out of users. Some apps/games which are free on Android are paid on iOS.=== Services ===If you are an avid user of Google services, you find something missing or uncomfortable in using their services. Android so much integrated with Google services such as GMail, Drive, Maps, Photos and so on; you will find all of them on iOS but are no so much integrated.  My suggestion is to switch to Apple services wherever possible.=== Battery ===The battery lasts the whole day and is one of the best. However, the charger that comes with the phone is a low end charger. It won't have a quick charging facility. So I started using my Note 9 charger which works better.So that's all about my journey so far with the amazing iPhone 11.

  ‚ô¶Ô∏èPros :üîπÔ∏èSuper fast processor & OS as ever.üîπÔ∏èExcellent battery backup due to efficient power consumption.üîπÔ∏èSuperb ultra wide camera with natural colors.üîπÔ∏è Extremely tough glass protection.üîπÔ∏è Zoom in picture with audio.But .........‚ô¶Ô∏èCons weigh more :üî∏Ô∏èUgly looking camera setup with no depth sensor & protuded camera lens.üî∏Ô∏è Too wide form factor & size to hold especially when you compare it to Samsung S10 line up with so sleek & sophisticated feel.üî∏Ô∏èUgly looking front screen with a very wide notch at the top for selfie camera.üî∏Ô∏èSuper amoled is much better in contrast & sunshine legibility.üî∏Ô∏èToo costly for the worth offered.ü§è Final verdict :*********************I suppose apple has completely lost its way in producing any innovative technology or design and just keeps repeating same looks and form factor since apple iphone7.Absolutely No appeal for the overpriced device.

  Have used iphone (4s and 6s plus) for last 9 years. Did not find anything exciting in this phone for price being paid now. No noted features compared to my old iphone, except larger screen size and better camera.At this price, one can rather buy Samsung S10 lite (SD 855), Bose soundlink mini, decent true wireless earphones and solid case (like Ringke, Spigen) and screen guard for phone.Switching to Android due to price and features given in iPhones now.Samsung S10 lite is very decent phone with Snapdragon processor. Photo quality of Samsung S10 lite is same as iPhone 11, and both run for atleast 4 years (based on usage) with good customer support.NO CHINESE PHONES DUE TO THEIR SERVICE AND PRODUCT LONGEVITY....

"

  After lot of reviews I went for this mobile and completely satisfied.. most of the ppl reviewed the screen quality is poor but I used led screens from Samsung mobiles and I felt not much issues with this phone.. of course there will be differences between led n this screen but this is something different from normal lcd screen .. display quality is good u won‚Äôt feel difference in day to day use..Also battery n performance is mind blowing.. I am moderate used about 4 hrs onscreen time n Battery  last for about one n half days easy..sound quality is amazing.. camera no need to say best in class.,Initially Only slight concern for me was thick bezels but after few days it got used to it..Overall great product from apple n I strongly recommend  this product and suggest to get at least 128 gb or more so no tension while shooting high quality Video.11 pro series are about 50K more than this product n have few advantages over this..Hence value for money product when compared to pro series ..This phone  will get good deal during annual sale , so wait for it and grab one..üëçüëçAnd last this is last product from apple with lcd screen hence anyone has issues with led flickering screen viewing then best option is this product..

"
"

  When you forget about the display resolution,you can‚Äôt say it is a average display while looking into it.apple make the best lcd panel.battery life is all day with moderate to heavy use.camera is superb.face recognition is just awesome.using for more than 7 months now. No lag,no problem. One has to use iphone for few days to see how fantastic,buttery smooth and easily to use iphone is. I bet one will never go back to android ever. Mind you its pricey but one can be assured for next 3 years its a peace of mind.

"
"

  Great phone. But don‚Äôt know why amazon has raised its price. This phone was launched at 64k but post lockdown, the price has been raised by more than 4k.

"
"

  I upgraded from iphone XR to iphone 11 and bought it for 63k and now its going cheap to 46k. But quality is not even worth 30k. While using apps phone heats up and app crashes. Gaming makes phone heat a lot and it crashes. Before iphone XR I had samsung s10 and i must say android phones are far superior in terms of performance. Apple iphone is just a low spec phone with lot of created Hype. And last but not least its stock clearance sale bcoz upcoming phones are 5g phones. Don't expect much from this phone. Only if you use phone like feature phone just to take calls and do little internet surfing than go ahead and buy it at a price of high spec phone

"
"

  Basically its not worth a 60k plus purcahse. Xr is a better option. Do not reply onnamazon exchange offer as thats a pain to avail.

"
"

  The price 2days before was 62,900 and now they have increased to 68,300...we do not have legal rules around this fooling mechanisms as to what should be the minimum time a price should be held...this is bad to increase the price just before the prime day...atleast maintain it for 30 days before the offer days...hope your PM is looking into this there is more to this than making profit.

"
"

  I was about to buy but changed decision on the last step, as I could not see warranty information on web-page. This made me doubtful.

"
"

  ¬†That's the video quality and that's the night mode camera. It's not that happening, apps keep crashing and don't spend too much hard earned money on these phone. You will also have face id issue, it will not recognize you half of the time, plus battery dies quickly

"
"

  Don't buy from Amazon when it comes to Apple or any high end product. It is extremely risky task, and most probably you will get refurbished or defective product.Better to buy from authentic Apple Store where you can also get some deals or just simply buy from Apple's website. Now it is functional in india.In order to save 5 to 9k you will end up risking rest of your money.

"
"

  Amazing performance. PUBGM Never ever lags. Not even a single frame drop. Smooth gameplay. I suggest you to play with battery saver on when playing games. It greatly improves battery performance. If you‚Äôre confused between XR or 11, Go for 11 if you can. It‚Äôs more future proof when it comes to performance. XR and XS MAX sometimes have a very little rendering when squads come close to you. It may become a frame drop in the coming years. So go for the latest and more powerful processor. And camera is too good.

"
"

  Experience facing heating issue from day 1 no solution from Apple will never going to buy any other Apple product ever again wasted my 70000 rupees on this piece of junk rather I should have something better.

"
"

  Not up to the mark I have lots of expectation from this brand but they does not fulfill my expectation as always my hole family use Apple product and iot devices but they always let us down

"
"

  I don‚Äôt know why as I read the reviews they say phone heats but I ignored and bought one and found out that really the phone heats up when watching videos this problem I didn‚Äôt encounter when using my previous iPhone X

"
"

  Best phoneBattery is good n it‚Äôll last for a dayCame performance is amazingI bought this phone n then I bought all the apple products I‚Äôm writing this review after using for 2 monthsI have tested the phone in all the possible ways I could till now no issues will update if found

  Product is okay and I'm not impressed that much from the camera believe me it's my honest review I'm  not able to capture portrait photos and normal picture quality is also not good... It's not value for money camera and selfie is also not effective night mode is not working

"

  Bought it for the camera to take great pictures outside. But I can‚Äôt even step outside of my house anymore :(

"

  Cable quality is not good it can damage your phone ,better buy separateBest lightening cable ..With higher watt adapter .

"

  Mobile is awesome but sometimes it‚Äôs shows too much heat for small task.

"

  It is better mobile comparing with other brand in its price range , bit upgraded version for xr but not much difference

  ¬†Very Nice iPhone11 with 128gb, really awesome photos and videos. Battery life perfomance also well its comfortably run one and half day. Phone is slightly heavy in weight wise, but when you its in your hand, you forget the weight. Handsome and really nice look in black color.I am uploading some photos taken by iPhone11 and a video for the zoom testing in video mode, shot in 4k.Also nice Amazon.in delivery, got in after just 24 hrs. Nice Job TEAM Amazon.inThanks & RegardsGANESHK

  Packaging was below average.

"

  Android OS is Best √áompare to iOS

"

  One thing ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Apple‚Äù. Rest is known to all.I used multiple phones and even switched from apple but what apple provides you no other phones can.Bit disappointed with the delivery guy as he was trying to scratch my old phone so that the exchange can‚Äôt get completed.Amazon check and train your people to understand what is the difference between slight / light scratch and Crack!

"
"

  Best part is that Face ID.
