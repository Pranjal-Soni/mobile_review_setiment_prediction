  Disappointed totally with camera and display. watching youtube videos was pathetic. Rest of the features are ok.4GB/64GB, 5000mah, side finger print are the saving grace. Otherwise didnt expect this from vivo at this price!.Dont buy this spend another 1000rs and go for many other better phones out there.

"
"

  In 10 days display is blank and battery over heat no response from service center when we request for replacement......really very panic when we put this much of price cant they treat properly this product i personally requesting all dont choose this brand...Because i dont want see the others to struggle like me....very worst

"
"

  Although the phone looks good, it is more than 6.5 inch long and heavy, making it not suitable for keeping in pant pocket.

"
"

  Awesome speed and battery backup, phone set up quickly and restore backup within few minutes, overall features are so good...Must buy it

"
"

  Good to use Vivo brand

"
"

  Not at all good. Look is good, but the quality of the product is so cheap.That's how Indians are getting cheated from these Chinese makers with their cost effective mobiles.

"
"

  Very nice Product.This Product is too good. It's camera is also very nice. I have ordered Black colour and in black their  is Blue shine and it looks wonderful.

"
"

  The product is above expectations and colour is much eye feast thing ... over all satisfied with product and delivery. Features are good and camera is superb clarity .

  Selfie camera is not at par. 8mp front selfie camera is not taking good images. Focus problem, blurry images, even the quality is not that good at 8mp. Low light images are nightmare.I've purchased vivo y20 few days back. Images by front camera is terrible.
