  I am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Defective product received, it gets 8 to 12 hours in charging and Amazon is not exchanging the product

  Very poor performance. Hangs aloft. Even I don't use any gaming app. In browsing only, this phone lacks. Inspite of having 6 GB RAM. This product serves zero rating. Please don't buy  this. Wastage of money. No refund policy for this device.

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.

  Value for money.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

  Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were1. When recording slow motion videos...there is  always flicker on screen.2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue....Suggestions for people who have bought this phone.....Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early...Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone.....If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..

  Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition.

  Just one word AMAZING

"

  The phone(M21 Raven Black) is not working properly since its purchase. After the first installation, it is on frequently on and off mode and even restarts after more than 30 minutes. Moreover 4-5 times it takes more than 2 hours for starting.I also register a complaint to Amazon regarding this. I don't need such a disgusting phone any more. it wastes my 3 days. So, I request to Amazon kindly refund my money, I don't need replacement.

"

  Now Amazone has REPLACED THE DAMAGED ONE NOW THE PHONE IS GOOD ENOUGH...PREVIOUS ONE WAS Nonsence What A Nonsence Battery It Comes to 90% Charge After a full charge only if u do something in10 minutes.... What nonsence is this. NEED REPLACEMENT. Do you people think customers are Mad.

  Heating problems

  Looks like just to clear the unsold stock of m30s they gave it a new name and advertised it as a totally new phone. Everything is similar to m30s, except the price (and selfie camera). Good thing is that they kept the price low.Just got it delivered today. So far so good, many users compalined about battery, charging speed, display issues on m30s. Hope they got it resolved in m21.

  Worst phone of my life I have ever purchase . Due to this pandemic situation and blaming china for this corona virus I have decided to purchase a korian company phone . But I broke up my trust . Battery life is poor as it's shows 6000Mah but performance wise it's behave like 4000Mah. Bcuz it's drain so quickly processor is very slow it's hang up in 5 minute and heat like u can make your veggie on this even it's can burn ur ears finger print is not responding I have washed my hand many time but it's not ready to recognize it's. Finally my humble request to amazon pls return this I have made a big mistake to purchase it. Pls help me to return it

"

  A nice looking phone.Light weight because of the plastic body. Performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth it's price. Probably not good for high performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.

"
"

  Samsung Co. Claims that Samsung M21 has fast charging facility and It has 6000 mAh battery but these two claims are totally bogus because I've purchased Samsung M21 and received my order yesterday after using this phone I plugged in charger for charging it took approximate 9 hours to charge the Mobile phone and after full charging approximate 2 hours the Mobile phone battery get reduced 50%. I'm totally disappointed with this phone.

"
"

  Don't like this product. It looks, it's already used by someone else. Apps are not downloading. It shows 6 appsare downloading. I'm confused.

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ

  I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21.The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED displayThe issues I faced are1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP).4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k

  Amazon delivered a defective phone to me and then they don't even receive my call while I tried to approach them.  Buying Samsung Galaxy M21 is waste of money.

"
"

  Samsung m21 Mobile not in the delivery box, only charger and pin are available. Need refund for the same.For mobiles, its better to opt for cash on delivery, to avoid getting cheated.

  1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon.2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor.3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that.4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.It‚Äôs better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.

  I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent.I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.

  Display good, battery  performance  after one  week  of use has improved,camera is good,hope Samsung  provides  regular  updates..Excellent  phone  keep good  work  up Samsung üëå

  Realy very very good phone,but stil I did not get,due to covid

  There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone.1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever.2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone.Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give.Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm.Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge.Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone.For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.

  What can I say just after 30 min.of recieving this phone I applied for return my money. Before this phone I already have 2 phone of Samsung's working good but this phone made in India is hot like a oven.I can't take it near my ears .I have to use ear phone.I call customer care they give me different different idea but problem remain same.I don't give advice to buy this product to any one be careful.

  Battery  drain quickly... and phone heat a lot.

"

  I got phone having mic issue and there is no option to put a replacement request as i tried download the blanco app that doesnt work and just hanged in between and no technical person available to check whenever i called..so how would i place the request to replacement??

  Amazing phone But m not satisfied with camera quality, its 48MP? I used samsung galaxy S8 its only 12MP single camera which is good for m21 tripple camera.One more thing is back panel is plastic which is not good looking inthis range ..Its not feel premium with this budget....

  recently i ordered samsung M21 6GB RAM 128GB Flash.Unboxed and started the phone. it surprised to see so much of heated while booting itself.I tried to inform to Amazon . they tested with some remote diagnostics application surprisingly it showed the temperature is degree.I am using Samsung phones long time. this time my experience with M21 is very very badNew buyers please little careful about heating issue

  Received Samsung M 21 yesterday..highly disappointed  about slow charging and poor quality of camera..did not expect this from Samsung.I suggest not to buy this mobile.

  Great phone. There is no overheating like others say. For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life.Here are the pros:-Good qualityExcellent displayExcellent batteryBest cameraHere are the cons:-Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at allHeadphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby AtmosCharging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mahCamera app need a redesignAside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.Go for it.

  I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength.Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s.M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacksM21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50sBattery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick.Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage.Pros:Super amoled screen6000 MaH batteryCons:Signal strength is very poor.(You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app)Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc

  Good product

"
"

  The phone is simply amazing. The Raven Black model looks gorgeous. Very sturdy. The camera quality is excellent. The UI is user friendly. This phone is similar to the Samsung range of phones, so it is hard to decide the model that's best for its price. According to my analysis, M21 is a good by at 12699/-.

"
"

  At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it...Only problem i faced is delay in delivery (almost 10 days).

"
"

  Pathetic phone. It is overheating and I am not able to use it. Worst customer service from Amazon guys as they are saying blanco app shows heating as normal in diagnosing. Awful service and worst phone.

"
"

  Not as expected from samsung, this phone heated very badlly , it's heated in ideal mode too, started slowly slowly and within 5-10 minutes it's heated extremely.

"
"

  I got this phone on 15th of May.I am writing this review  after 5 days of usage...1.Battery backup is not very good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.Also charging is really slow.2.It's SAmoled screen is best in this price range.3. Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags.4.Heating issue detected in front camera areasIt's not like overheat or something but it is hot.5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively.6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time.7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason.8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage.9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now.10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.

  Mind blowing  mobile .. dear mates don't go for this.. network related issues  frequently  will get. 3 and 4 bars network  points is related to 1 and 2 bars in samsung.. what they mention in community samsung I'll tried. But nothing .. so please think before purchase .. big disappointment  in samsung m21.. check in screenshots  that's In some outdoors  lan area if u go upstairs  1 more bar extra only showing,same thing I checked in some other mobile it's showing full .. I think some issue in m21.. please release the update. I'm very dissatisfied about samsung.. actually  I love this design  and camera...

"
"

  Nice rear camera and nice selfie camera but front camera struggles at night , sound is superb, display is awesome, battery ok, fingerprint reader superfast, I would suggest 6GB variant.

"
"

  The best to choose among the available choices in this range.  I am using it since one week and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen. But these purposes were fulfilled by external apps from the play store.I strongly recommend purchasing this phone. The best value for money product. I am full satisfied with the purchase üòä

  Just after starting the phone I am facing the heating problem . I have bought two phone in both of them there is over heating .

  Ski charging and bad network connection

  So, here it is after using it for more than a month. this phone has a lot of impressive features but lacks a bit of punch when it comes to processing power.My usage is mostly for calling, whatsapp, and video viewing, i don't use much of social media apps and not into too much gaming as well. Still this phone manages to freeze even with just one app running it can be just the chrome browser. Here is summary of what i observed  - Samsung one ui comes with lot of annoying advertisement and notifications, i suspect these galaxy app hog cpu in the background  - Privacy is a huge concern specially with discover feature  - For those who are accustomed to having google news feed by swiping right on home screen, you will find it missing in this phone  - Phone freezes a lot, typical workaround for me is to lock it and wait for a minute unlock and it works  - Wide angle camera shots are really good  - camera quality is nice as well  - battery life is  great, i am charging every two days instead of daily night  - look and finish a not extra-ordinary but are not bad as well  - Does not allow you to restore from google backup on start which is a headache on setting it up, it does come with samsung switch app but that would just install app and cannot restore login and data like google restoreverdict=====Buy this if you are ok with advertisements (i guess same is true with mi, realme etc) from samsung, not too much into heavy usage like gaming etc.Edit 1====phone freeze issue reduced by a lot by removing external sd card. Browser does freeze sometimes but the frequency is a lot lessSamung ui misses user friendly sms/call blocking, you have to select individual message sender details and then block which is a headache and can be improved

  Everyone is removing Chinese products from their life and hence I also planned to throw Xiaomi from my gadget and start using Samsung from now onwards. I further thought to convince my friends & relatives to use Samsung gadgets instead of Xiaomi. But after purchasing Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon which was delivered on 30-05-2020, my whole enthusiasm went in trash and I am helpless to compare it with my last handset Redmi 8 which was valued just Rs. 7,999/- as compared to Rs. 12,699/- of Samsung Galaxy M21. I don‚Äôt want to compare Samsung with Xiaomi handsets, but now realize how Xiaomi has captured Indian market in short span of time, surely because of quality & performance of their gadgets.I am trying Amazon customer care since 01-06-2020, but unable to connect and no response from their side. Below are serious issues found in just 2-3 days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 :‚Ä¢ While using wi-fi calling feature, outgoing calls & receiving of SMS gets completely barred‚Ä¢ While using wi-fi, HD call gets stopped‚Ä¢ Whole battery gets drain in just 6-7 hours, not upto 6000 mAh handset performance.‚Ä¢ Fingerprint sensor is very weak, it takes 3-4 times for login‚Ä¢ Dual apps feature is limited for few applications only‚Ä¢ Voice recording feature needs improvementPlease support in getting this issue resolved at the earliest.

But after 2days it started showing sone battery problems and battery lasts only upto 3 to 4 hrs which not accepted with this phone and it's getting even worse now. And now Amazon is not responding to it . It seems like i lost my 13 thousand money.  If any help provided it means alot to me coz i didn't expected this kind of trust issue with amazon.

  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

  Samsung galaxy m21 (I'm having 4gb ram variant) is a excellent phone in this price segment.Pros:1. Best display under 20k2. Great audio quality via headphones jack (supports dolby audio which is obviously a gimmick but this phone has high res support hence if you have Poweramp you would get maximum quality performance from it.) and has a loud output from loud speaker.3. Excellent battery life (for heavy use easily getting SOT more than 8 hours)4. Great for watching movies supports for FHD+ playback in ott.5. Good performance, not stutters or lag I have noticed (I usually dont keep more than 3 apps in background when in not use).6. Games don't lag or have frame drops if I have moderate graphics. (Even pubg runs great in smooth and extreme settings).7. Samsung One UI is the best next to stock Android (Oxygen os, stock android no big difference except few additional features in Oxygen os). Also comes with Android 10 out of the box.8. Decent camera quality both front and back.9. Unlike previous m series phones this one comes with Corning Gorilla glass 3 and I haven't applied any screen protection and have no scratches till nowü§ûü§ûü§û10. Multitasking is the best feature in this phone. Pop up view mode is a excellent festures. Helps to play games listening to music in youtube or other apps, text messages, browse web simultaneously with this large display.Cons :1. Plastic back can easily get scratched can be avoided using a case.2. Could have added 18W fast charging capabilities takes 2-2.5hours to fully charge (from 15 or 20% to 100).3. Not for gamers who expect high graphics. But recommend for casual gamers or gamers who would be okay to play in moderate graphics.4. Worst camera quality in night mode. Night mode photos are totally unusable. (Samsung may fix this issue with software update if they work on this issue)Conclusion:Don't know why many are complaining about poor battery life or heating issue or games totally unplayable complaints. Dont spread false informations.I haven't faced these issue, even in heavy useage.Buy this phone if you want a all-rounder phone which ticks every boxes.Fyi,Like all other phones in this price segment, even Samsung pushes ads, but here during initial setup of the phone it ask if we would opt for recommendations. If we opt out we wont get any ads and recommendations.üëçüëçüëç

  Battery charging takes too much time and when opted for replace, so much of formalities by amazon. Highly disappointed of purchasing such a valuable item from Amazon. Only by technician check, and after his report, amazon decides whether the item should be replaced or not. No value for customer words. Very bad experience with amazon purchase.

  This is my second review.  This is after a week's use. So far I have found that phone is good. In my first review I had tod that battery is not that good. But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish).One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there. I have to go all the way back to search again.

  Recieved it today.1) Battery is excellent- can last for 2 days with average usage.2) Camera is good according to price of Mobile- Don't expect DSLR level clarity but it's good.3) Phone is running without any lag. not a gamer so haven't run any game.4) Network and voice clarity is excellent. Haven't faced any problem.5) Touch ID is respsonsive.I would say in this price segment, the phone comes with excellent qualities.

  It's all in one product. With a big battery life and large display. Back camera is awesome with all the beautiful colours. The best thing I like about samsung is that it's user friendly. My first android was Samsun and the new one too. Am too excited abt using this new watta monster with 6000 battery life and 48mp camera.

  Let me be Straightforward, being passionate photographer I was looking for a budget Smartphone with a nice Camera and good Specs. But after Purchasing Samsung's M21 what I had found was it is Monstrous in every aspects of a budget Smartphone. From Monstrous Battery life to an Amazing Camera, Nice Ram Management, Clean One UI 2.0, and tons of other perks...If you are looking for a Monstor Budget Smartphone from a Reliable, Reputed and Trustworthy Brand then without wasting time go for this one !!!‚ù§

  Guess it was a problem with the seller, and not the product. The seller just delivered a used product with loads of defects. The camera was not functioning, the torch was not functioning and there could be more defects. I was just checking the item the moment it was delivered and encountered with these two defects. Upon unboxing, I found that the phone had a tempered glass already fitted to it. Initially I overlooked this but later realized that someone who had purchased it invested on the glass (and may have used it for a couple of days) with the defects before finally rejecting it. I think the M21 product should be fine and it is upon the seller who tried to strike a deal in such troubled times. So beware of the seller!

  Worst product it takes so much time to chargeHow can a person charge for al10 hrs to fully charge the battery.Its insane and am not able to replace the item.Amazon must be liable for this product.

  What a nonsense phone this is.. battery performance is very disappointed... 4000 mah is  too better than it's battery.... more than 12% battery is losing in night-morning.... heating is another important issue ... with out playing any games or hard use, this phone heats high... display quality is so good... don't by this phone, considering its battery... no use.. charging time is very high.....

  galaxy m21 review:-first of all, it's a very similar device to the galaxy m30s galaxy a50s and galaxy a51 in terms of internal you can't tell the difference between galaxy m30s and m21 in just looking at it. there are some differences between the two devices but not a lot.good:-Display:- so this is the main feature of this phone a full HD super AMOLED display on a 14000 rupees phone is very rear and this the differentiating feature of this device, which include lots of feature of own it's own such as always on true notch hiding and some battery-saving features so it doesn't have the on-screen fingerprint sensor which frankly speaking a good thing because Samsung's in-screen fingerprint sensor is bad really bad it's that bad you  prefer not to use it, and it's fingerprint also have swipe gestures for the notifications which work all the time unlike it's the in-display fingerprint sensor.Software:- software is also really good and it has some neat feature too like the system-wide dark mode which saves battery on the AMOLED screen's and clean and well thought out layout for the one-handed use a good if not great out of the box launcher with few customizations, unlike some Chinese OEM's software, hex installer, and the good lock is absent which is a big bummer for the customization freaks and overall it's nicer UI than most of the Chinese ones and one thing more it also supports android 10's stock navigation gestures which are a heck of a lot better than MIUI's.battery:- it's a full day battery comfortably with all the necessary sensors on the auto-brightness and vibration both of which disabled out of the box for some reason ""because Samsung thinks we are a fool"" it's a 6000 MAH battery if this type capacity would provide another phone my be it was juice it out little longer than this phone does.camera :- this is very strange camera in default camera app shoots very saturated photo and the video is good honestly quite good for the price in day light in nights this phone just falls apart very easily, and wide angle camera is fixed focus which is a good thing or bad thing I don't know, I use it very occasionally and I I am surprised to see that AR doodle and AR emoji is present In it's camera app which is nice bonus.Bad or desired thingBuilt quality:- it's a have a plastic back with a plastic frame means it's a plastic phone and have plastic's quirks like despite having a 6000 mAh battery, it feels light, relatively thin and more ergonomic, it's a plastic, plastic materials are more prone to be scratched but it more durable than glass, if tap on the back around the camera it creates hollow sound so built quality is not on par with the competition.performance: - performance leaves a bit desired because it handles everyday stuff like WhatsApp Instagram and other productivity Apps quite smoothly and in games, it's fall flat in front of the competition and in the 4gb variant 2GB of memory is occupied by the system already so ram Management is an issue in this device, and the stupid battery optimization is killing all the third-party apps in the background some of the like the music app suddenly stops playing song after 1 hrs, you have to disable the battery optimization from the setting in each app you use in the background all the time.Bloat & Ads:- it has all the Microsoft suits preloaded and be careful when you set up the device at the start don't select the option ad recommendation option. even after that my galaxy apps constantly send the spammy notification.so it worth 14000? In my use case yes! I am not a heavy user I don't play heavy games on my phone, for the heavy users, there are lots of better offerings on the online market!

"

  Only display is good. Sound quality and ring volume is Not good. Some most important features like App Lock is missing in this phone. You have to download a third party App to encrypt your App. This is very disappointed. Ring volume is very low and very limited ringtones. User interface is not good even Not user friendly. No headphones, No back cover, No screen guard. Dear Samsung, you need some research in this field otherwise you will be eliminated. Very bad experience.

"
"

  It's kind request to everyone who is looking for this device, Don't buy it unless you live in area where network strength is strong.Network fluctuating all the time, hardly you Will get 4G, forgot volte Main issue is camera ... after 11 days i saw dust inside camera lens,  dust in brand new phone, Amazon customer care told after 10 days we don't care about anything, talk to Samsung customer care. Samsung care says go to nearest service center,Service center vale says submit your phone, we will see.  Aatmnirbhar ke chakkar me apna chutiya mat katva Lena bhaiyo. Although battery is too good, display is premium.

  Camera quality not that much what we expect rear and selfy both camera -pic quality missed , battery life max 18hours if we used data , This report as of after 3days usage

  No doubt i am loving Samsung m 21 4/64, which i ordered on 25th may, got delivered on 27th may. One thing to consider, this smartphone excels in display, camera quality and battery life...Processor is not that  powerful or not even close to sd 675 in terms of gaming. I have to use gfx tool, lowering resolution( less than hd) and other graphics stuff to Low with fps set to ultra(40fps). By applying this gfx tools settings i can play Pubg hell lot better with stable 30-40 fps. Dont try extreme,fps will be very unstable. With stock Pubg settings i am facing tremendous lags, stutters and fps drops even in the lobby, Cant say about 6/128 gb model. Didn't try Cod, i usually dont play, Pubg lite plays fine with smooth extreme option only. My verdict if u are not too much into gaming, Play clash of clans, or can adjust to above settings of Pubg, Go ahead to buy,  If pubg is top priority go with Vivo U20/Realme 6/Redmi note 9.

"
"

  Review for 6GB/128GB varient (Review after one month use)Pros: Really a amazing phone in peformance wise. smooth like iphone. Battery last for three days even with wifi and bluetoooth connected for almost 10 hours a day. High end games are running without lag. Dual speakers so music plays loud. No heating issue as of now. Depth camera is really cute, you must experience it to believe. Corrila glass doing its part perfectly. No scraches even after rough one month usage. Screen resolution in amazing; Super Amoled is really superb. Finger print senson is fast (even less than a second)Cons: Apart from depth camera all other cameras are not upto the mark. But its ok for unprofessional use. Not recommended for selife freakouts. Phone is little heavey due to 6000 MAH.

  For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.Samsung Galaxy M21: Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display.A few months back, Samsung successfully made big-battery smartphones accessible with its M-series. But the mid-range is a tough segment to crack with the competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Realme. But Samsung knows how critical this segment is right now, given the current situation where consumers are more price-sensitive than ever. For these uncertain times, the new Galaxy M21 makes a lot of sense. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what it‚Äôs been like to use the Galaxy M21 over the past week.Samsung Galaxy M21 specifications: 6.4-inch FHD+ SAMOLED display|Exynos 9611 processor, 4GB/6GB RAM or 64GB/128GB storage|48MP main camera+5MP depth and 8MP ultra wide angle|6000mAh batery|20MP front camera|188grams, 8.9mm thick|Android 10, OneUI 2.0Samsung doesn‚Äôt try to be different with the Galaxy M21, and that‚Äôs just fine. Let me be clear: I don‚Äôt have too many things to say about the Galaxy M21 because the phone looks exactly like the Galaxy M31. So, the Galaxy M21 has a polycarbonate back like the Galaxy M31. Some people may not find it interesting but it never felt like using a cheap plastic phone.For a phone with a 6000mAh battery, the design and build seem perfect. I also liked the fact that the phone doesn‚Äôt feel heavy or bulky, considering the massive battery inside the device. However, I do feel the Galaxy M-series phones have become a bit too dull in terms of design. To be frank, none of this matters to a user who is coming from the Galaxy J-series or any older generation Samsung phone.Although the phone excels on many fronts, my two favorite features remain the battery life and the quality of the display. The 6,000mAh battery in the Galaxy M21 goes on and on. It managed to last one and a half days with my standard usage pattern, which includes browsing the web, listening to Spotify, emails, checking Facebook and Twitter, and light gaming. Since the phone‚Äôs battery lasts for so long, you don‚Äôt want to worry about taking the charger with you. A quick-charge with the charger fills the phone‚Äôs battery in minutes.Another aspect of the M21 that I liked the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn‚Äôt annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.Speaking of performance, the Galaxy M21 is powered by the same Exynos 9611 chipset that you find on the Galaxy M31. Samsung has used this processor on many of its mid-range phones and going by my testing, the chipset gets the job done. I was able to open all of the popular apps like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok on the device without any issues. But don‚Äôt try to run too many heavy games that could slow down the performance. The phone runs on Android 10, and Samsung has done a good job with OneUI 2.0. My review unit had 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage.You won‚Äôt get a great camera system, and that‚Äôs one area where I think the phone falls flat. You get a 48MP primary camera sensor alongside an 8MP ultra-wide camera and a 5MP depth camera. The 48MP main sensor is a hit and miss. Sometimes the photos look great and other times the photos come out of focus. That‚Äôs not to say the camera is bad, it is just not consistent. The Galaxy M21 takes bright shots but in some cases, images lack richness. Even though the phone lets you take ultra-wide angle shots or bokeh shots I wasn‚Äôt too impressed. In comparison to the Galaxy M31, the Galaxy M21 pales in the camera department. For a change, though, the Galaxy M21‚Äôs 20MP front-camera surprisingly worked well both indoors and outdoors.The Galaxy M21 performs similarly to the Galaxy M31. I mean, both phones have a 6000mAh battery, identical processors and displays, and even the design is the same. What the Galaxy M21 noticeably lacks, however, is a camera that‚Äôs not at par to the Galaxy M31. Still, there‚Äôs a lot to love about the Galaxy M21. For those who are still using old Galaxy phones like the Galaxy J2, I think the Galaxy M21 would make logical sense.

  No wonder why Samsung is the most used & most loved smartphone brand in the world! This is my first Samsung phone and I exchanged my previous damaged phone online for 2k.After spending one whole month in researching the best phone under 15k, I finally got it figured out and chose Galaxy M21. And Youtube videos and comments helped me take the wise choice. I got the deal (4gb 64gb) at Rs.13,500 and got it delivered in 6 days.Plenty of reasons why I chose M21:Will to honour our country heroesMonster BatteryGreat Display (feels like you are also present in the movie)Trust in Samsung Brand NameBetter CameraLesser weight (a boon for long time gamers)Polycarbonate back (safe against drops)Premium look rather than Fancy Nancy cheap plastic bodyType C ChargerThe Processor Debate:To those who wonder the same as I did (If we can play Pubg smoothly),The honest answer is YES. Pls do not take third opinions who claim that Exynos processor is lame (which is a false claim of knowledge). I can't say if it is bad or awesome, but it is definitely Decent! You can play Smooth+Extreme or Balanced+Ultra without any issue. Even if you do full and heavy usage for 12 hours continiously, battery is sufficient and fast charging works too. So i easily charge every night before going to sleep and turn it off in middle of night.Super Tips for Common Problems in All PhonesUpdate OS to avoid heating & restart issue (which happens not only in M21 but even in 60k phonesNever use a phone cleaner or battery saver app. Use the inbuilt power saving option.Turn off Bluetooth, Location, etc when not neededDon't charge even after reaching 100%Close apps when not needed, especially close all when playing game (and also enable gaming mode)Uninstall least used appsWhoever reads this comment can trust me and click the Amazon ""Buy Now"" button without any fear because this is the ONE perfect-ish smartphone under 15k category.Friends.... this phone feels like you hold jewel in your hand .

  ¬†So of course battery and display is awesome.The charger is not soo fast but its okay, decent performance ,but i am very dissappointed with  its camera its not upto the mark (48megapixel) photo quality achhi nhi lgi, it doesnt capture the details  not even is this good for night or low light photography and in video its focus is worst

"

  ¬†After reading a lot of reviews regarding network issues of the M31 and M21 I was a bit skeptical to buy the M21. I was using Huawei honor phones until now because of their excellent call quality and network reception. After using the Honor 6x and Honor Play I was thinking of buying the Honor 9x pro but after I found out that it did not support Google Play I opted out. So then I began researching other brands and I came across the Galaxy M21. The features were promising but the negative reviews regarding network held me back. By chance I happened to come across a video in YouTube regarding LTE / 3g / 2g settings in the M21. Bingo! I knew where the problem was. So without waiting any longer I ordered this smartphone.After receiving it and using it for a few days I am glad my decision was correct. In fact the call quality and  network reception of the M21is much better than the Honor phones which I have been using for a long time.The reason why this network issue arises is because after inserting the Sim and starting the M21 the OS of this phone selects the LTE/3G/2G (auto connect) option in Mobile networks by default. I am using Jio Sim and Jio is only 4G. Now if by chance the 4G signal becomes a little weak the phone will search for 3G or 2G signal and in doing so the call or network signal may drop or get cut altogether since Jio is only 4G. So if I select the LTE only option the phone will latch on to the 4G signal even if it becomes a little weak.So for those who have Jio Sim and have network issues I will suggest that (1) select LTE only option in Mobile networks (2) In Access Point Names open 3 vertical dots and Reset to default and immediately reboot or restart the phone. I hope this helps.

  Just one word. It's best. Purchased it in 15 may 2020 at 12,999 till now phone's performance is superb. Guys don't go for realme or redmi or vivo, oppo.

  I got Samsung M21 in 13999/-  Comparing to this price rangePros- 1) Display is good.2) The camera is good in daylight...The end.Cons-1) while charging, Heats up like a hell.2) battery is on documents 6000mah but in real performance definitely not 6000mah3) Camera quality in low light is not good4) while surfing on net again half upper portion of the phone gets heated. (not checked when playing games?)5) The processor is really average6) Phone hangs even searching in contacts then no keys work only power key ..switch off and then switch on.If you want to purchase only for display go for it.

  19 July 2020, 1:45AM : This product has some ""MAJOR NETWORK ISSUES"". None of the SIMs (Jio, BSNL, Idea) are getting network on the phone (-113dBm 0 asu). The signal always shows either ""NO SERVICE"" or ""EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY"". I've put all my day diagnosing the problem but it still persists. I'm really frustated now. No doubt about other features, the phone has really good camera, speed and sound.PS: I want my problem not only to be addressed first but also provide a solution to it ASAP. Contact me whenever required, take my data from Amazon Database.

  When I start hotspot in this phone, and try to connect laptop to it, it fails. When I make hotspot with any other phone, my laptop connects instantly, but only with this phone's hotspot, it keeps on rotating the cursor, or says ""can't connect to this network"". I need urgent help with this otherwise I will have to get it replaced.

"
"

  1. I used for the last 120 days in according to my usage battery backup is good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.2. Its SAmoled screen is best in this price range(best of this cost), Design-wise ergonomically fit in our hands.3. The processor is powerful but at the same time i have noticed some occasional lags.4. Heating issue detected sometimes in front camera areas but don't worry about because it's not high.5. Sometimes fingerprint sensor not working fastly otherwise it's good.According to cost-wise, this is the best mobile, especially from Samsung.

  Facing some issues in network connection. 4G network is not stable whereas it was stable in my old phone. Otherwise it is a very good phone.

  I have never been a fan of customized Android phones, and have mostly preferred phones with the stock Android. I was looking to a new phone because the manufacturer of my earlier phone did not support security updates that were required for my work apps / email.This is my second Samsung phone, after the 2010-launched Nexus S. Compared to earlier phones, this feels a little big and is heavier as well. Perhaps it could be due to the battery. So far, there is nothing to complain about, but I would have liked the price to be comparable to the Redmi models. I got this one for ~ Rs. 14K, which the seller claims is at a Rs. 2K discount. I wouldn't have bothered to pay Rs. 16K for sure. The Redmi Note 9 comes in at around Rs. 12K for similar configuration. I would have bought the Redmi phone, but the reviews made me feel suspicious about it (especially about the ads being displayed).Some stand out points:¬ß Made in India: I didn't have a constraint on this one, but hey, if it's made in India, then, why not.¬ß Selfie camera: Samsung says it us 20 MP. It is definitely better than other models I have been using. (Note: I almost always prefer phones below Rs. 15K)¬ß Android 10: This itself was my constraint. I was looking only for Android 10 phones. One of the most important things for me was the support for dark mode.¬ß Reputed manufacturer: Well, Samsung is the leader. So, can't go much wrong with this brand.¬ß  Minor irritants:¬ß¬ß The setup process feels as though using the Samsung's Smart Switch app is the only way to get data from your existing phone. If you do not want to use it, the setup wizard is slightly different than the stock Android version. If you have a backup of the previous Android phone on Google, that can be used as well. However, setup takes a long time as compared to the stock Android version.¬ß¬ß The location of the back and recent app buttons on the navigation bar are swapped. I had to install a button remapper app to swap the 2 buttons.¬ß¬ß Samsung tries to push its own apps and its account sign up. I avoided it like plague, and deleted all the unnecessary apps.¬ß¬ß I prefer the Nova launcher app. I feel at home after installing this app.In short, after some customization, it was back to what I wanted.

  The only feature I liked in this phone is the ringtone.  Camera not that great. The user feel is missing and for me it just like my 10.or E with negligible added features. The phone is overpriced at 15500 (got the mobile delivery on 12th June).  Heavy to hold and inconvenient to handle. Worst part is  Amazon doesn't have a return policy and suggested me to do a exchange instead with another brand of my choice (with heavy deduction of course). Amazon accept a return for the mobile case though and processed for refund, the mobile is lying with me and wondering what to do with it.  Am just not too happy with my choice of purchase on Amazon. I would henceforth make a resolution to buy from a mobile store after physically checking a  display piece.

  If you are looking for gaming mobile, then m21 shouldn't be your choice.Pros- Only display and brand nameCons- camera is third class, I was using realme 3 pro and 16mp camera is way better than m21's camera.Selfie camera is pathetic, working like 2mpAfter update camera has been worst I guess.Processor is not good, as game with normal graphics is lagging, I think pubg is not possible in this device.Ram management  is pathetic.Battery drains quicker compare to 6000mah.I played car simulator, believe me guys l, graphics are pathetic even in when kept on high.Dolby atmos, a joke from samsung, my realms 3 pro was way better in sound output when it comes to device speaker or earphones.Clarity of camera in auto mode and pro mode is worst.Don't buy guys, go for better option, seriously telling you.Don't believe  in good reviews. I am giving you honest review of this product.Only buy if you don't play games and you don't bother about Camera

  Buying this product is a waste of money. The single phone cost is 15000 rupees but the quality and performance is very poor. There is no cover no glass with the phone and when purchase from the market  its cost approaches to 15500  rupees. Battery performance, Ram and camera quality are very poor and showing 6000mah,6gb,4 8-8-5 megapixels which are beyond limits actual they are not so. Other features are very less in comparison other quality setsI am not interested in this product

  I bought this product and after 4 days the charging is not happening...Any how I gave the mobile on Samsung service center and they repaired and handed over me within a 1 day.The main issue with Samsung is the PRICE. They usually charged 3-4k extra as compare to MI1 star for defective mobile5 star for samsung customer service

  The product is wast never buy M21this moblie it is wast of money.The moblie get hanged offen. I got first samsung  moblie this was my first non Chinese  moblie and i am quite  upset with this performance. Hence do not buy M21 ..4gb atleast. Even you tube vedio get stuck offen. I guess  this mobile phone  has Week  processor. It takes lot of time to open the gGoogle Chrome  with jio fiber net. And even with idea  net work aswell. So pls do not buy M21.i feel cheated.  Lot of problems  with the phone. Worst mobile i have ever got in my life.

"

  Samsung M21 is  Manufactured in India and even brand is from S.Korea. I am very happy to move my mind from ""Xiaomi/mi to Samsung"". This is not a war, lesson for China :)I have pledge to boycott all China products!Here is the review:Good phone with long battery life, the feeling of touch is amazing. Value for money.

"

  Here is my review on the new samsung m21.I'm using this smartphone from 2 months so I can give my comment to help you guys make up your decision. I categorise my review based on the following points: (a) Built Quality (b) Display (c) Camera (d) Performance (e) Software (f) Battery(A) Build quality: It's a nice looking phone with a standard build quality nothing fancy on the back. Plain standardised back side with glossy finish but very well built keeping in mind it has 6000 mah battery. It's feels quite light in hands. It's a sturdy phone and it can handle if it accidentally it drops sometime. If you want to get fully packed phone in this price range it's a good phone to buy with this build quality.(B) Display: We all know samsung make great displays so here also it's a 6.4 inch water drop notch mailed display which is amazing in this price range. I bought this phone only for its great display and cameras. I mostly watch videos on my phone and it's a great experience. Even the touch response is also very good in samsung phones. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery is a great combination.(C) Camera: Camera is it's highlight in this price range. Samsung captures very good photos with a good balance of colors and natural sharp photos. The colors in photos are not over saturated. It takes very good photos. M21 has 20 mp front cam and 48 mp back camera which takes amazing photos. Samsung live focus provide some amazing features. Samsung UI is brilliant providing u some amazing features in camera.(D) Performance: Samsung's performance is quite balanced with exynos 9611 series processor. I don't do much gaming but for occasional gaming it will not disappoint you but specifically for gaming you can check out some other products with better processors in this price range. But for day to day usage it performs good and samsung hi provides great performance with this processor. So you are getting a good camera bigger battery and sufficient powerful processor.(E) Software: Samsung UI is great no ads altogether and has great features which are really useful. You can check some videos on features for samsung UI. I like the Samsung standardised UI which is great easy to use and smooth.(F) Battery: For battery it's a 6000 mah battery so you can expect a 2 days battery life for normal user and 1 day full use for heavy users who do a lot of gaming movie and videos watching. But for battery you can give 7 star and samsung did a great work by keeping the phone light weigh also with this massive battery inbuilt. So it's a great phone in this price range. Fully packed samsung phone.

  Phone is very good. But charger is not up to the mark. It takes 2.5 hours toh charge from 1%  to 100%. So plz change this charger. Although performance wise ph is superb. In 15000 rs range . Ultimate ph

"
"

  the battery is too good and pubg works fine too.i reccomend not going for brands like mi realme and other chinese brandsbloatware free (adfree) one ui is even better than stock android. camera is fine too.Another thing is that dont go for the realme 6 or 6 pro for its 90 hz display because its ips lcd.amoled 60 hz is way better than that.

"
"

  First time buying a Samsung phone and absolutely loved the experience.......the phone is 9/10 overall...The feel in the hand is really premium even with polycarbonate back...I've held glass phone and this phone doesn't feel any cheaper....Samsung didn't make any compromises with phone ...my only complain is the fingerprint scanner it takes a little swipe to unlock rather than a tap...I'm not quite used to this.....the performance in public is great too.  ...I reccomend gfx tool to achieve true 60 fps possible to GPU optimization in premium gfx tool ......the best thing about this phone is the battery ....... it's a beast and nothing can beat it in this price range....I get minimum of 8hrs of screen time in my heavy usage with the phone playing games and using social media apps.....its my new favourite phone...thx to samsung

  Your representative visited at my home in connection with complaint regarding fault in my phone.  But till now no reply or action has been initiated to redress my complaint.  Please do the needful at the earliest as my business is adversely affected due to faulty mobile phone.  After this request if no relief is provided to me I would have  only option of legal action in term of newly introduced consumer protection act.

  I was looking for a smartphone with good battery life for using it as hotspot, all other features were secondary for me. I am satisfied with the needs but I have to mention below thingsPros:Battery is good as per 5 days of usage with 30 + default google appsScreen is bright and very good to look atno lag for normal apps (im not a game fan) ConsWorst ever camera i used on a smartphone. 48MP is just the size of image, quality of what it captures is patchy and bad images. Camera quality compared to the advertisement is very bad.Heating issue when screen is on while charging.

"
"

  First when I got this phone I found it has issues with mic. Hence I placed a request for replacing the item. Second time also I faced the same issue. When I am the caller, the receiver is able to hear my voice clearly. But when I am the receiver, caller is not able to hear me properly. I need to talk louder in order to be audible. I returned the phone again. I would want Samsung to check this issue and work on it. Otherwise all the other features in this phone are value for money.

  Perfect mobile phone with more storage space, Excellent sound quality with Dolby atmos ,extended battery life ..I tried to use full night to watch OTT web series.. morning 42% of battery life is pending.. if you keep volume less than 50% we can't hear any sound ..company should improve this .. we can't keep volume with 100% at all time... Inbuilt functionality of install 2 social apps like WhatsApp ,FB etc., my suggestion .. if you are looking for phone less 15000 with so many features. This is one of the best model to look:)

  I got the delivery yesterday. My last phone was Poco F1. M21 is a good phone at this price point. as its a big battery with 15W charging capacity it will take anywhere between 2.5 to 3 hrs to charge but once charged it can easily go for 2 days for non-gamer. Camera is good at this price point.The best thing is its Samsung, which has good after service and if you take samsung care + home pickup and drop. for M21 2 years the price of care+ is Rs1349 with everything covered except theft

  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month. The box comes with M21 handset, Power adapter, USB cable and ejection pin. Earphones are not included in it. The battery performance is quite good, it takes not more than 2 hrs to charge completely from zero to 100% and on medium usage, can last upto 2 days. The phone handset is very light weight as compared to M10, M20 which is very heavy to carry because of heavy weight of battery. One good thing is that the M21 handset as well charger or power adapter is made in India. As of now, the overall performance is good, battery output is efficient though there is some heating of device during charging, only sometimes & not always. Camera quality is good too but in natural light settings. I need to use this phone for some more time to further write detailed updated review but at the end of the day, Samsung can be trusted for their phones.

  ¬†I Ordered this product on 28th july 2020 and recevied the delivery packet by 30th july 5:00pm (Delivery speed was good though.)I payed the order amt to delivery guy and after receiving the payment, he handed over me the phone. And full of curiosity i opened the delivery packet in front of  delivery guy.what i found is that phone box has all the accessories perfectly But the sad part is phone itself was missing.I mean did i just paid 13999 rupees for a samsung charger and a data cable and ofcourse the sim ejecting tool.Just warning you guys , maybe you won't even get the charger , data cable and sim ejecting tool .Be Careful While paying at this Product or even any other product from Amazon.So, this is the real face of amazon india services . this is their customer satisfaction and after sales service.I dont know that who was faulty at this , it can be the seller , delivery agency , or warehouse staff(as it was FBA product) . But the responsiblity of managing all of this goes to Amazon Only and that's why they charge high comission fees from sellers.

  Biometrics is good i.e. fingerprint sensor and face recognition works very smooth. Phone performance is smooth , do not lag.But :-1. 6000mAh do not run for more than 24 hours in normal usage, no games, no music, song, just net crowsing over wifi.2. Camera is 48 MP but the sensors behind it make that 48mp pretty useless, the moment you zoom post taking 48mp photo (3:4) you will find out that it is not 48 mp, as pixel started splitting.3. Personally I did not like UI, so switched to Microsoft UI and that works smooth.

"
"

  The seems ok. Plastic built phone. Camera is ok. Charger and cable seems poor in quality. the packaging was so poor. thank god that the product reached home safely. only a plastic cover as available. company not including any earphone, back cover or screen guard, nothingis present. its my first with with the phone.

"
"

  Amazon deserves the innumerable accolades for delivering this phone in this maze of lockdown.  This is ineffable service from Amazon. This is great and uncomparable phone. THANK YOU SAMSUNG..outstanding performance and extraordinary battery life..

"
"

  The phone doesn't even turned on and It's not getting charged also. Unfortunately there is no return or refund policy for this. If you want to return this item you have to install one smartchek app and diagnose the issue, otherwise Amazon will arrange an inspection service at your delivery address and you'll get a replacement only if the technician is convinced. Amazon is simply cheating it's customers. Never expected this kind of discourteous service from Amazon.

"
"

  All of you guys know what are the plus points. Let me tell you the negative points-1. Camera is kind of ok ok, I have Realme 2 pro 16 mp sony sensor.. both are kind of same. But Samsung's hdr and dynamic range is superb.2. Battery not optimized. Maybe next update will fix this issue. Screen on time 8 to 9 hours. No gaming.3. Samsung running on February security patch. But my Realme 2 pro 1.5 year's old device running on latest security patch. Samsung's update policy is worst.4. Sometimes UI freezes just for 1 second. Not an issue of processor. UI needs more improvement.Hope it helps! Cheers!

  Batterry is verry verry very poor

"

  Previous generations of Samsung phones used to provide better quality though. This one provides excellent specs for the price, but doesn't come with earphones and its charging cable is very short. I have to use a USB extension cable to make up for that. Operation is real smooth and lots of space. Camera is okay, battery is great but that's the ""standard"" in the age of Mi. Fingerprint reader frequently fails. Lots of features I enjoyed in the older Galaxy J7-6 are missing though. Thankfully almost all my customizations are preserved thanks to Smart Switch. Still for a Samsung phone it has too much bloatware. Thankfully I am able to disable all of them. Guess that's why the low price, I'm content with it, with this RAM, storage and battery it'll make overall usage comfortable.

  Review after 10 days..1.battery life is awesome.5/52.charging time is 2.30hrs from 0 to 100%.4.5/53.camera quality is nice. 4.5/54. processors is good for multi tasking but not for hard core gaming however causual games work fine 4.5/5.5.no network/call/data issues. 5/5display is awesome.5/5 no doubt.6.fingerprint sensor slowed down after 10 days 3/5.Overall al best budget phone but the delivery experience was horrible the delivery person was very rude to behave and even refused to come at the parking of the building...i could have rated 1 star but i don't want to spoilnthe reputation of the such big  company like SamsungYOU CAN ALSO SEE THE QUALITY OF INVOICE RECEIVED.....üò°üò°

  Overall seams good,I gave 2 star for battery life,Inspite of power charger it's take too long to get full charge. Also drain fast even optimization of power consumption ie reducing brightness, background data off etc. Although battery is 6000mah but doesn't seams inside more than 3500 mah.If you don't use much wifi, bluetooth , video than battery may survive longer and meet your expectations.Look and touch feel, speed 4gb Ram good thats why 3 star.

  6GB RAM, 128GB storage, colour black1. When recording slow motion videos...there isalways flicker on screen.2. Camera is just awesome3. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming4. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phoneSuggestionsIf you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....

  I have note 7 pro. Comparing that to m21 it has poor quality.Case low quality comparing to note7Camera in note 7 is betterSim pouch very hard to popoutSoftware customization is not that much better.All app in this version is old. Looks like m20 is packed with few modifications.Battery chargi√±g taking too much time. 2A chargero ly. While realme provides 5A charger that really fast charging.It has every features to say, but it is a low class product. Even not have an expected Samsung quality.

"
"

  It's a very nice mobile phone considering the price range and configuration it comes in. I'm using it for a little over 2months now.PRO's:1. Has amazing  camera  quality.2.Battery live is good as well..lasts me for a little over 24 hours. With YouTube, Shopping and other basic use.3. Speakers are pretty loud..exceeds expectations.4.Font and other icons display is larger than usual...will be useful  for the elderly folks.5. Over all look and feel is good.CON's:1. It's not fast charging as claimed. It takes round 2 to 3 hrs to full charge with wifi and other apps running. Else it takes 2hour to fully charge with all apps closed & wifi turned off.2.Fringer print recognition is not accurate,it atleast takes 3 -4 attempts to recognize it.3.Too big to fit in pocket. Uncomfortable to ride he bike with it in the pocket.4.Body is delicate-my phone slipped from my hand without any force..it has a dent on the backside.

"
"

  Display is the highlight. Best display on budget phone.Battery life is acceptable above 1 day of normal use. Charging takes much more time.Dont buy it for playing pubg. Battery heats up and after one hour very high frame drops and frequent restarting.Camera is way better than any other phones in the range. Skin tones and colour reproduction is somewhat natural.Overall good buy in the price range except for gaming.

  I'm reviewing my Samsung Galaxy M21 phone after 15 days usage & If someone tells me to say something about it in minimum words then I'll say """"It is Awesome"""". It is a perfect NON-CHINESE phone in mid range for me, I was too confused about it even after purchasing it but when i used this, I'm loving it.Pros:1. It's huge 6000mah battery survives 36 to 40 hrs in normal usage.2. Super AMOLED display having very nice colour contrast and all.3. Camera, it's selfie camera having wide angle photo option & flash too and rear cameras also clicks very nice pictures, even in night both the cameras satisfies me and are very good in this price range.4. Latest Android 105. OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It's Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Iske alawa bohot kuchh hai isme jo maine expect bhi nahi kiya tha.Cons:1. One thing I don't like in it is it's cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.Bus PUBG nahi khela maine isme. So I can't say anything about that.üëçOtherwise, It completely satisfies me.üòçüòçüòç

  Review after using 10 days..This Mobile has lot of issues..1. Network reception- This is really  lower than other mobiles..  There is low network  in my house but other mobiles work perfectly.. In this mobile, network i m getting is almost negligible..2. Battery Issue - company  claims  it to have 6000MH, but it drains too fast. I have compared with my 2 years old MI phone(4000mh). This phone drains little faster than mi. So what's the point of claiming  6000 mh3. Voice audio quality - quality  of the voice which you listen in your ear while talking to some is really bad like a cheaper phone's. Mostly  you need to be very attentive  to listen.4. Heating issue - And I have also read the reviews  that people are also having  heating  issues. Though  I don't have this issue still..

  After using samsung m21 and verifying  its features I reviewed as fallowsLiked features.  1. sAmoled  display  2. Processor/interface  3. Finger print sensation time, face  recognition  time.  4. 6000mah battery life  5. Light weightSpecifications which does not meet expectations are as fallows (i.e  defects)  1. Heats up while charging  2. Under 10k phone we are getting  18w fast charging facility why not in  this case?  We get 15w fast charge  facility here but it's feel like we are  charging our battery from past 1  day  3.camera does not satisfied expectation  Lag in frame rates. Cameras are not  at their best  4. We are buying phone at  it's best  price but company fails to provide  its protection by avoiding temper  guard,backcover.  5. Low sound enhancement quality  6. Fails to provide premium back  design.By reviewing all features.I conclude it's better to buy other reliable cellphone under same price.If you are a samsung lover go for it.If not go through other device features and grab a better among one.Think twice before investing  some buks on cellphone. Grab better one .

"
"

  It is the worst mobile I ever had. Company claims saying Gorrilla glass 5 protection is not justified as its screen broken with a single slip while sitting in the chair from my jeans pocket. Further no one is there to listen. We feel so bad that in India where there is world's largest market of mobile consumers, still there is no best mobile which can compete these Chinese cheap and best mobiles. I love my India. So will wait....

"
"

  The battery is not actually 6000mAh but slightly less which is around 5830mAh the battery comes around for 18 hours on intensive usage which is quite good for a phone on this budget. I love the texture of the phone. But it slips a lot when used without a case better go for a spigen case which is really good combination with the phone. The interface of the phone is quite simple and very easy to use . For people with smaller hands it is quite hard to reach the top with single hand . The camera is great but it goes hazy for night shots.Overall it is a great phone .

"
"

  I had to wait for long for this mobile as I was told that this is getting sold out very soon. And indeed it stands upto its reputation. To sum up, solid built quality, excellent display,  fast processor make it stands apart from its Chinese competitors. Don't Get fooled by its specs which say that it has polycarbonate body. Its rock solid chassis justifies its price. I'm not a gamer but I bought it for my mom.  So it's perfectly alright. The battery life reminds me of old ""Hero Honda "" ad of "" just fill it and forget it"" . The speaker is not that too loud but quality of music through headphones is very good especially when you switch on Dolby atmos. I used sennheiser px80 to test it. So please don't waste time and grab it.

  My review after using 1 month of this phoneDemerits:-1.Charging problemMostly it takes 2:30 to 3 hr for full charge and sometime(when heating) it charge only10% in an hour2.Internet speed meter not available3.Private safe/space not available for photos or videos4.Its maximum brightness is even low, & doesn't give proper view in high sunlight5.Wifi wps not available6.Not works properly in low wifi range or less wifi catching capacity7.AppLock not available8.Heating problemMerits:-1.Good battery2.Camera quality is also good3.Screen display(SAD) is excellent4.Fingerprint sensor is also excellent5.its Samsung, not any ChineseNeither indian company nor Chinese but made/assembled in IndiaAfter all cons and pros overall phone is very good. You can neglect these minor problem if you want good battery, display and Samsung.You may buy it.Samsung ka etne features ka koi b phone is se ssta nhi milega

  I was apprehensive about Samsung phones offered at this price but just to teach Chinese a lesson I opted for Samsung galaxy M 21 and it didn't dispoint me at all.Followings are pros and cons of this mobile1. ROM RAM are much much more .  I got more than 3gb of free RAM space and more than 115 gb of memory available.2. Camera and selfie camera are class apart and I felt that rich detailing coming back to pic which was lacking in Chinese mobiles.. "" camera quality - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê""3. Huge 6000mAH battery is really long lasting.. one first full recharge it took 2 days to come to 30 level even with continuous uses. ""‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê For battery.4. Display is super rich. Can be easily distinguished from othe phones mostly Chinese.. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.5. Finger print reader is super fast ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.6. It's light weight and super amolded screen is eye catching ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê.Easy to grip and premium looking.ConsSome common features are lacking which are otherwise given in most phonesNo net speed  indicators. I just downloaded one small app from store and now it's working fine.No option for zooming in when using 48 MP cameras.. however still shots are super rich..No screen guard, back cover provided with phone.Overall it's a gud buy at this price range..Samsung is trying to recapture its original lost out to Chinese filthy mobiles.. earlier it was not offering this much of features with less pricing. However after Noida plant Samsung is in no mood to spare Chinese mobile companies.Request to all my friends.. pls find one suitable phone from samsung or other indian companies as per ur requirement. However in absence of good phones from from india we can give Samsung a try. All price range and ROM and RAM options available. Pls go for Samsung phones

  I bought M21 (4gb, 64gb), delivered on 27th june. Notice a distinct yellow tint on display (whites are ivory). have tried multiple options: vivid mode- white balance, rgb tweak, adaptive brightness, dark mode, blue light filter off, no success. Tried to search a bit, looks a like lot of people are facing yellow tint issues with Android 10 UI 2.0. Samsung: is there a fix for this?. I have a S8+ (which luckily I cant upgrade to android 10). Screen tone of S8+ (whites are whites!) and M21 (ivory whites!) are quite different. Apart from this, proximity sensor working is intermittent, voice quality on video call is pathetic! Samsung, what do I do with this phone- return option not appearing/ replacement is showing..that too if smartchk app finds something wrong (these problems are not even listed). So all doors closed? Of all the problems, worst is the display..causing severe eye strain and headaches. As of now using at near zero brightness level. Suggestion to prospective buyers: pls look elsewhere! Samsung: please suggest a solution (for what its worth, I am regular Samsung customer, using 5 devices- mobiles/ appliances as of now). This one was a real disappointment! Kindly help!

  I got this device yesterday.Initial great impressions, sturdy phone a bit on the heavier edge because of the huge battery.I am rating a perfect 5 for the amazon packing and service provided.I am happy with the device, its pretty smooth with the new Samsung One UI, lot of great features and improvement on the older samsungsThis is the first time i have decided to buy a Samsung phone. I never bought them because i never liked Samsung's UI.So overall happy but a 3 star rating for the device because of the defect inside one of the camera lens i don't know how that happened. But i am not happy seeing it. I know this is a low-budget phone. But i do not expect such carelessness from samsung. I know its a small thing and i can still take photos but i don't feel good that it's there.I wanted this phone urgently, i have use for it. So i cannot even replace this phone because I need it. Once the lockdown is lifted i will have to visit the service center.Such a good device. But a small thing that ruins the experience Samsung. I don't know how quality check misses this.

"
"

  Ultimate phone.Excellent finger print reader, display, battery back up is fantastic, speed of processor is like bullet, camera quality is excellent better than other brand s phone of even higher range, memory is more than enough, in this budget this mobile is incomparable with any other brand.I am writing this review after six months of usage.Must buy..

"
"

  This phone is very much similar to Samsug M30s. Some few differences include 20 MP front camera and android 10 in M21. First I bought M30s four month before and now I bought M21 because the price was lower by 2000/- compare to M30s.The phone performs decently in almost all aspects except battery backup. The M21 is giving highly disappointing battery backup. Even though Samsung claims that it is a 6000 mAh battery, it won't last for more than One & half day with normal usage like phone calling, messaging, WA and some banking or office apps.My M30s with same 6000 mAh, was giving (I lost it and so I bought M21) me the battery backup of 3 to 4 days leisurely.If battery life matters for you, don't go for M21, instead buy M30s only.

"
"

  not satisfied at all. its front cam is pathetic which has filter by default, my redmi 5A, 3 year old phone worth 6999 takes much much MUCH BETTER photos than this disgusting ''Samsung smart phone''. There was an issue of switching on of hotspot which was sorted out after contacting the Samsung agent for around 39 min.  These phones are refurbished phones and not brand new phones which i didn't know and we cant return it as its not in the  policy, we can only replace them. LOL. well.....i just wanted a budget smart phone not COMPROMISE, which now i have to. My personal suggestion-if anyone wants to buy Samsung, buy it from the store not online coz these are not new and would definitely create problems.

"
"

  1. I put the phone on charging, but it ran into a boot loop for no reason. Then I opened in factory mode. But after choosing to restart, it would again go in boot loop. Then I choose safe mode. But it did not come back to normal mode despite many efforts and restarts. The only way to restart it in normal mode was to format it. So, I had to.With my experience in the first month, I knew the phone is not stable. Nor it is reliable. So configured important folders for auto backup on Onedrive so I won't lose important photos and Data again.2. The battery is ok, yet I think not 6000mah. My 3 years old phone with 4000mah used to run for the same one day. It runs a few extra hours than the old one.Rest is no issue.

  After 1 month of usage this r my observations :)Pros:1) Excellent screen2) Great battery backup (u will have to tweak some settings to get the best battery backup).3) Decent camera performance.4) fast fingerprint sensor.5) Non-Chinese brand.Cons:1) Average processor.2) Poor Low light camera performance.3) Poor pubg performance.4) 15W fast charger is not enough takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the phone.5) No protective case in the box.Overall: If u r looking for a reliable Non-Chinese phones for day to day tasks and light gaming then just go for this phone.

  After 3 days of use I am posting this, bought this phone for my wife who was using Redmi Note 5.Small things which is available in competition products with lesser or same price makes lot of difference. After 6 years of experience with Xiaomi we did lot of Research to change and chosen Samsung as preferred one.But am little disappointed with the performance here is pro's & cons.Pro's:1. Slim and very light to handle2. Audio output3. Lot of features inbuilt4. Battery backup ( comes 1&half day for moderate use)5. WiFi direct callingCons:1. >2 hrs charging time2. Doesn't feels like 48 megapixel & 20 megapixel front camera.3. Screen notifications are worst, you don't have screen led light blinking when any notifications come, so everytime you have to touch the screen to check for notifications.4.  Doesn't provide back case which competition does.5. Plastic back panel looks like ordinary phone for which you have to spend 16k.Overall not fully satisfied with this phone. As mentioned Samsung, has a big brand should small things should be implemented.

  I love this phone and currently have no complaints regarding it. But I would love even more if its sound quality would be better. The only thing I hate about this phone is the plastic body which seems too brittle to break, but it's quite strong enough. Its 6000 mAh battery is too long-lasting and could easily give you a battery backup of 1.5 days. I even play games on it and it can easily handle COD mobile and PUBG mobile on medium settings. But if you want to play on high-end settings, I won't recommend this phone. I got this deal at 12699 and compared to the price I have paid, I am completely satisfied. Thank you Samsung and Amazon for the best delivery experience as expected.

  An amazing phone, been using it for almost 20 days.Absolutely no unwanted Bloatware like the Chinese phones, an amazing Battery which lasts almost upto 2 days, with continuous WiFi Google meet and Zoom calls, Fair amount of E mails, Surfing and online streaming.Super fast Finger print scanner, very easy to setup. Solid build quality, with good look and feel of the phone.Good camera for the price point almost matches my iPhone XR. Super fast charging with Type C. Go for the 128gb version it makes more sense.This is any day better than the cheap Chinese copies on sale today.And oh yes forgot to mention this is 100% Made in India

  REVIEWING after 1 month.Bought it for INR 12,699. It took around 2 hrs to 2.30 hrs to get fully charged. Amazing display. Sound is equally good. I didn't try installing heavy gaming apps.

That's all I would say.Pros:üëç Type C cable with fast charging.üëç Camera is excellent[support super slow motion videos].üëç Decent battery.üëç Super AMOLED display.üëç Comes with android 10.Cons:üëé USB cable is little short.üëé No earphone.üëé Lot of preinstalled apps like helo, tiktok,...

  I have bought this smartphone around 3 month ago. Below is my experiencePros.1. Smooth amold display will blow your heart. You will definently like display and color of display.2. 6000mah Battary will provide you breakthrough performance. You dont need to charge again and again like other phone. Charge once and use whole day.3. Camera Obviously  48 mp back camera and 20mp front will provide you amazing photography experience i am not good in clicking pictures. Hence i uploaded some of photos. I belive you can do better than me.4. It have 4GB RAM so you can do multitasking eseily. No lag while playing PUBG or COD whith high graphics setting.5. If have game launcher which is amazing feature providing by samsung. Like it will track time spending on a single game, while playing if someone calling you will get very short popup to receive call or not.6. Again amazon sevice did great work even in lockdown. (5 out of 5).7. Manufacturing in india. And samsung relible brand.Cons.1. Charging time is too long even it have fast charging still you have to give 2hour to 2 hour 30 minute for full charging.2. I didnt like back side look but i still bought beacuse of feature and brand value and pricing.So overall my final rating is 4.7 out of 5. You should go for it.

  The phone has these positive sides :1. Great display. AMOLED is hands down better than any other technology.2. Great Battery life.3. Great software experience with ONEUI.4. Great form factor with low weight. samsung made the phone completely out of plastic to adjust for the wt of the battery.5. Type C charger.The bad parts:1. Speaker output could have been better.And that's it. It is a great phone with a great display- the actual thing u tend to look at all day round.GET IT and be HAPPY.

  I have been using this phone for the last one month and till now I did not see any technical defect in it.  This is Samsung's best budget phone so far.  I would like to give it a full 5 stars out of 5, with excellent emulated display, great processor, battery performance and camera quality.

  The Samsung M21 is a budget smartphone with professional features at a pocket friendly price. The smartphone has 48 MP camera that does justice to photos and videos. The phone has a dual sim which means it is like carrying two phones in one, without the need to lug two physical phones. The phone has VoLTE capability and supports the latest 4G SIM cards and protocols. The massive battery is a boon for those who need to keep on ""chatting/talking non-stop"". The fingerprint reader is located on the rear side and is extremely fast in responding to fingerprint recognition. It is a great buy at the given price. Go for it.

  I bought this phone for my mother but used it for couple of weeks until I orderd Vivo z1x for myself. My mother is a casual gamer and plays light games. She also watches lots of videos and stream movies. And according to her needs I found this phone a perfect match at an unbelievable price (12699). I was looking for an amoled screen as it causes less strain on eyes.Display : Display is super awesome. Very bright and accurately colorful. I use Vivo z1x (Super amoled) and Samsung's display is far superior than of Vivo's. Daylight visibility is very good.Battery : Battery backup is excellent. It is easily giving 9 to 10 hours of screen on time. Charge it once and use it entire day without worry. Buttttt there is a major con, charging speed. It's 15w charger charges the phone very sluggishly. It takes almost 2 hours and 45 minuts to charge it fully.Camera : Camera performance is mediocre. It isn't great. Photos are good in daylight condition but things get bad in low light. Selfie Camara is also mediocre. Considering the price, Camara performance justifies the price.Sound : Speaker output is decently loud and clear. Headphone output is outstanding (because of Dolby atmos support).User interface : Phone runs on One UI android 10. It is majorly seamless with no lag. One UI is nice and feels premium. It has many customization options. There are no annoying ads or recommendations.Gaming : Phone performs excellent in light gaming. No major lag. Since my mother plays light games only, it serves the purpose well. Buttttt if you are a heavy gamer, please skip it without hesitation.Network : There is no issue in network or calling. Video streaming is also excellent. Good network reception.Cons :1. Sometimes finger print sensor is hit and miss. It annoys, you just keep rubbing your finger on the sensor and nothing happens.2. If you are a heavy user (who uses lots of games and apps) then phone will not feel smooth.3. Charging speed is very poor. In this fast lifestyle, it's very hard to manage with slow charging.4. Mediocre camera performance.5. Face unlock is bit slow and doesn't perform good in low light.Conclusion : I wanted to buy a phone for my mother and this phone fulfilled all the needs such as Amoled screen, big battery, decent processor, good sound output. Camera wasn't my priority. Overall very satisfied with the product.

  Just purchased this phone as i had no other option as i dont support chinese product anymore.The picture quality of the phone is great but the phone starts hanging while using whatsapp. Even after using it for 15min the phone becomes heated . To disconnet the call you need to tap twice on the cancel  button.I had used Samasung Galaxy J7 few years back and it was my worst experience ever. I thought Samsung being such a big company might have improved the quality after years. But i was wrong.When you spend around 14k-15k you expect a gorilla glass but it's the disadvantage with M21. My phone fell once and the screen cracked. My older phone K9 note fell many times but nothing happened coz it had gorilla glass. Pity on such a poor design configuration by samsung.Strong suggestion to buyers....Never go for Samsung , keep it as a last option to buy.

  This my review after 4 days of purchase.  I bought this for my mother who is a teacher. She wanted a phone with screen recorder. As all classes are online for the past few months due to Covid teachers r taking online classes and submitting the same to their heads. As her old phone did not support recording on 2 mics I had purchased this phone as it is a non Chinese best brand. Butto my shock it does not support 2 mics and for her it is a waste. All other mid-range chinese phones support recording which is in built. I did not expect this from such a good brand.  This forces us to buy Chinese phones though we want to boycott Chinese products. I hope Samsung brings in a new update to correct this problem.

  Regualr updates are required to boost system and software  performance.Camera is awesome rear and front.Functions are smooth and buttery .Watching movies and videos are very pleasant.But Some of the bloatware and third party apps  like Helo,likee,etc are yuck and must not be preinstalled. Thank God We can uninstall  them.Go for it .You wont regret except for regular android updates. only Feb month software update is provided so far by default. DONT KNOW if they provide regular security update or not.But it's  performance is by far smooth and well.While Doing DUO video call I felt heating of phone.Let's  see if it is improved in next security update.Samsung should provide headphones,back cover, tempered  glass with phones at their end.Regards,Edit:31may 2020Yesterday  took 30/40 photos and my phone Galaxy M21 appeared hot.Photos were quite good.What astonished me is this phone's  battery management .It generally takes three days to discharge.Actually I am a moderate user So It's expected but want the same performance in future. Samsung's own EXYNOS processor needs overhauling in comparison  to qualcom snapdragon and media  tech..Will add further information in due course02 june2020YouTube playback is sometimes stuck which I Experienced two three times.Software update is major issue.My preused samsung headphone is not compatible with its Jack.Loose .So doesn't works it ought  to be.My Nokia is much better than this phone is every aspect.Not a single time Hang or stuck during any usage.Samsung's  main problem is its processor which is required to be reengineered.In 30 july2020 got an update which was done  vastly. It feels good when the phone is updated regularly since it removes glitches and boosts performance.Samsung is listening its consumers I guess so it is providing updates.What I see in this update is battery is draining  a little faster than before.I am satisfied.Samsung should provide earphone, backcover and screen guard with every models I reiterate.Regards,My review is being altered.for some days  this phone has gone unexpectedly unresponsive. Touch is hectic and the display panel is heated .Samsung has provided me used phone by Amazon. I swear I will never buy  and persuade anyone to buy Samsung mobile ever.

  So I hv used it now for two days and here are my reviews:phone is big enough at this range. Performance is great. There is a dark mode avalable for all android system which I really liked. I am more into camera and I will rate this camera 4. There is too much exposure for photos. But night mode is too good. THis is perfect for low light imaging. But it will overexpose, so u will have to reduce the brightness. Also normal video will zoom a bit which I dont like. But u can shoot it in wide view as well which gives it a different feeling. The pro mode of camera for photos is less adjustable but it can overcome these limitations very well.The battery certainly lasted about 1.5 day on average usage with games, photos videos etc. At this price I think this is a v good deal.

  Yes.Cost efficiency is what i would call the super trait of M21 to be.This is the worthiest set to be bought at around ‚Çπ 15k. Best Battery capacity and display (super AMOLED!) at this rate. Decent chipset.Been using it for a month. And it, indeed, is very good in overall performance and is more cost effective than I thought. In fact more cost effective than all the Mid Range phones I've bought so far.A massive 6000mAh Battery will sustain the phone for minimum a day but to be honest it does not deserve the hype it got. Also inclusion of a faster charger would have made me happier. But im still happy man!It Does heat up a little bit while charging. But seriously manages to keep the cool even while heavy RAM usage.The design is not appealing coming with a plastic body. This is a small negative which is overshadowed by the remaining overwhelming positives of M21.The april 2020 update is good. Trust me.If ever there is an offer where there is a rate drop below 14000 for a 4-64 variant then go for it.

  My own experience of 3 days:-Battery- not working good as expected 6000 mah,it's looks like 3500mah.Camera-this is pretty good ,image quality is good.Fingerprints-some times fails to read ir fingerprints otherwise it's good .Network- I'm facing network issues with this phone ,internet connection some time collapse,and also my relatives complaint that he can't able to call me,but I can call him(it's happening since 3 days when I insert my Vodafone 4g sim in my new phone....Otherwise performance is good.

"
"

  All Parameters are excellent other than below mentioned Points I observed.-Battery Backup- with a normal Usage it will go from 100 to 35% (From 5am till 8pm), less than expected. Actually Some Background Apps consumes so much battery which can't be Disabled.-Camera is OK OK (Doesnt appear to be  48MP quality, there is no in depth clarity in pixels with artificial light), daylight quality is good.(Very very Slight Heating is always there), you can feel it in pocket.-You can't disable notifications related to auto update of apps.-Face Unlock doesnt works sometimes in little dim light,in Light it is good.-No option to display data speed over status bar.-Settings menu is little bit not user friendly. Little bit confusing.- My Backup from Google Drive could not be restored, as it was showing try again later, Tried two times but didn't work, you can only avail this option during setting it first time.Whats app Backup Restored.-Data speed was not good as it was in my last phone(just an Observation)

  I was searching for a phone under 14,000 which would be great for multitasking, daily use & regular gaming and the biggest thing was a great battery. I found many cheap phones from chinese brands making with about 1,000 rupees of difference. But they were unreliable and not as rough and tough as SAMSUNG is. The phones made by SAMSUNG are the most rough and tough phones you can find. And M21 would be a great pick for you. I am using this phone since 2 months and I don't have a single complain, not even a single complain. The phone is great for battery because the 6000mAh battery lasted all day long. I did multitasking and little bit gaming and used my phone the whole day. I just kept it in charge at night for half hour and then it worked for me all day long. The processor and RAM is also too good because I don't see any framedrops, not even a single framedrop in gaming. It is a very smooth experience and the next thing is that it never lagged when I was operating it, never ever. The camera is also a nice pick, the 48 mp camera gives you an awesome shot with the 8mp and 5mp secondary cameras. I also liked the selfie camera because it's of 20 mp and is enough for taking breathtaking selfies. The samsung UI is also a nice pick with a good look and updates also come regularly. The display is just awesome, it is just breathtaking. The Amoled display with the notch gives you a big hit. LAST THING, THIS IS THE BEST PHONE IN THE GIVEN PRICE RANGE, YOU CAN SURELY GO FOR IT.

  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks.Pros1. Manufactured in India2. Display is really good. I can surely distinguish this from my old phone3. Battery life last more than a day even after high usage4. Dolby atmos sound enhances video and audio experience5. Camera is fantastic. Does a good job for a noob photographer like meCons1. Charging wire could have been little longer2. I miss led notification lightOver all Samsung has done a very good job in mid range segment. At this price I did not wanted to purchase some other brand with UI that is more like a adware

  Bought in Amazon india. As mentioned,product was made in India.Which I liked.Comes with ejector pin, travel adapter and usb, and manual with warranty.It supports fast charging. It was mentioned that The USB cable was made in austria. adapter made in India.Takes quite long process while initial start. Make sure that you select what you need.Pros1.Country of Origin-For buyers who look for Made in India phones,definitely you could get this.2.Battery suits for very normal users.3.security Mcafee comes with this. we need to turn on for security.4.Processor is ok.5.Super AMOLED display6.No heating issues.7.Android 10 with UICons1.Mono speaker.2.Camera light output is low. Camera wasn't appreciating. For this price camera design should have been better.3.Lot of preinstalled apps,which I don't like.4.Takes quite long time to charge. Even fast charging mode switched. This was unexpected.5.No headphones or screen guard provided. We need to buy separately.6.Dolby gets switched only when you use headset,bluetooth headset mode.ConclusionGood phone for normal users. I think it won't suit for heavy smartphone users.

  Just after 2 weeks of purchase, this Samsung M21 smartphone suddenly got hung and a portion of the screen is not responsiive. Immediately I  raised a complaint. The technical guy of customer care not even bothered to listen to the complaint. He just told that the return policy expired two days back, just two days and I dont even know about it. How can one expect that this kind of cheap goods being delivered to us. They can stop working at any time if they are too cheap. Amazon thinks the customers are like fools living in amazon forest. They should consider the complaint and need to respond in a constructive way. IN this pandemic matter of two days should be considered and extended.Apart from all these, the service is so bad and irresponsible. They are saying go to the samsung service centre. If we can go there why should one buy from your site? Because we believe better service from you irrespective of who the seller is. If its an offline purchase we should have checked every thing there itself physically. Since its Amazon we blindly ordered just by seeing images but later realized that it is also like ultra low grade e-marketing company after talking to this customer service guy. I just dont want to take his name. When I say how can we go out in this circumstances as ours is containment zone. He simply told not to order from amazon as they also cant deliver here. Amazon should seriously look into this guys behaviour. He is going to make you loose many customers.Finally, I suggest not to buy electronic products, particularly samsung brand from Amazon. Please go and buy offline. They are also suggesting the same indirectly.

  Good product by SamsungBut I think samsung is also going the way of other cheap China mobiles by selling our data. Maybe to tackle the competition?First time when I switched on and starting updates I found other party apps like like videos ,Facebook and other unnecessary  apps started to get installed without my permission.But later these things have to be removed  settings tweaked to tackle the problem and it was really tough.Wasn't expecting this from samsung.(may be they thought that this is low end phone so why to worry?)Camera is good for its priceFingerprint reader and face recognition lock are useless in this price tag as you know if u mind or security as a basic

  Purchased Galaxy M21 for sister as it is non-Chinese. But now I am regretting not buying other brand. Such pathetic M series was not expected from Samsung.Only gud thing abt this phone is Amoled display, large battery and decent camera.Rest everything is impractical...be it1. Plastic back- plastic back is finger print magnate and will get scratches easily.2.Rear fingerprint placement- fingerprint position is so upward that literally u need to find it . Also it is so flat with back body making diffictly in distinguishing fingerprint sensor with back body.3. Slow Processor- processor is slow/laggy. Phone started getting slow from 1st day of usage. Slow opening of app or buffering type slow response which irritates a lot.4. Heating issue- Most pathetic thing abt this phone is its heating issue. Means it will heat more at earpiece area only(upper part of phone). I have used other phones also...but samsung makes record among all in term of heating issue.5. No screen protector and phone cover- Many brands which are much cheaper than Samsung and gives equal quality at low price, include screen protector and phone cover but I don't know why Samsung is doing this. Now I will have to buy it separately.Overall I am disappointed with Samsung mid range phones as they are not made for practical purpose. It will not be wrong to say why brands like Mi, realmse got big boom over Samsung. They provide every practical need which we want.Sorry samsung but this will be my last purchase of samsung phone.

  After around 2 months of using Samsung M21(6GB/128GB) phone it developed display problem..Also some network signal strength issues is seen after switching to this phone...I had to spend Rs 5484/- for changing display as they were telling display is not covered under warranty, many people are facing this issue. Better don't buy this phone.Fingerprint scanner is good Camera is average only.Battery will run for almost 1.5 days with single charging.

  First I bought this phone as my old phone bricked and I needed one urgently. Only criteria was a not a made in china decently modern phone. This one a21 and 31 were trending in market though my research 6 months back wanted me to buy an a50 something these two had the same features CPU etc and processor but lesser ram and storage and one camera less and some megapixels lesser but who needs them anyway. All I need is one decent camera on each side.The camera in this is decent and has multiple modes and options like AR AI and wide angle and so on. Its confusing and I felt not in control. So sticking to 16:9 standard pics. Still the depth is pixelated even at 48 MP.The amoled screen is amazing in vivid colors though it can be quite hard on the eyes. I am keeping it in dark mode mostly and there is also a blue filter. There are also calm modes which put the phone in black and white and do not disturb mode for me time  away from phone.The phone is quite bulky by today's standards about a centimeter with a cover. It doesn't have 5g support either which many new phones bring.This is a mostly made in india phone with exception of charger cable from Vietnam and I am sure the processor and circuits made in Taiwan or china. Nevertheless it was refreshing to see a made in india phone designed by Samsung in a world where anything we buy is made in china. Though I must say the finish of the product and packing is not of such high quality as chineese brands like xiaomi vivo not even compare to one+. But the product itself is of higher quality than chineese phones.The cost is much higher than normal times perhaps due to pandemic or import curbs from china. Atleast 4k more. Such phones are in the 10k range but still feature to feature similar prized mi or others have more cameras and glass body and many more features. Brought this only cos of Made in India.but it has to become  competitive in terms of quality and price to be successful.Update: After a weeks use updating to 5 star. 3 day battery though no real fast charging takes 3 hrs to charge full. Performance is top notch no lag or hang and smooth even with extra animations enabled. Overall happy with the phone.

  I had been always buying budget phones from Chinese brands for my Parents until now. Then I heard about the new Samsung M Series range of phones making sensation in the market with Super AMOLED screen and good configurations for the price. Decided to give it a try this time and ordered the M21 for my dad. Upon receiving the phone, I was blown away by the almost everything this phone was offering in this price range. The screen quality is amazing with definite 2 days battery life. The performance of the phone is more than adequate and easily compares to any other sub 15k phones, but the camera quality, battery and the screen quality surpasses almost all others in this segment. The screen quality is better than even my twice expensive phone which is having IPS TFT panel.Pros:Great screenCamera qualityBattery backupPerformanceSoftware refinementCons:Weight. But its justifying given the massive battery size.Plastic Body. But to be frank, we use phones with cases. So in that case, plastic body is safer than glass. So not a con actually.No bundled earphones. That too can't be really complained in this price range and also currently, no one is supplying the same.Verdict:I am loving it more and my dad is also happy since its a Korean and non Chinese brand and Proudly Made in India phone. This purchase made me order an M31 for my mother the next day, since she is really keen on phone camera quality than my dad, and since this 13k phone amazing for its camera, was having even high hopes for an 18k phone which is having higher camera specs.

  Battery life is the main USP of this M series, camera quality is not upto expected but at this price range seeing the other specs the little camera quality can be compromised and if you can really want a good camera then go for M31 or M31s . samsung gives the best amoled display it's a no brainer. Fingerprint is very fast , face unlock is good but not at best but fingerprint unlock works really fast, phone runs smooth as well I'm not a gammer so don't know about that , there is little heating issue only while charging the phone , otherwise I haven't noticed heating issue, the phone comes with minimal blootware that's the best , it is not like any Chinese brands like MI , oppo , realme where you notice adds , so in this samsung one UI there is a near to a stock android experience without blootware and adds and that's very good as well

  I loved this phoneThis has pure samsung flaship level touchresponse.Amoled display is amazing.Battery is amazing.And apart from all theseLook very expensive one in black color .Camera is good .Not heating .Network reception is amazing .Call quality is good .Speaker is good.Its like you hold jewel in your hand .This fone doesnt looks like cheap smartphones like redmi xaomi and real me .Build quality is amazing .If you are not a gamer then go for it under 20k .This is best smartphones and cheapest from samsung.I have recently used realme xt but that one also not feels expensive in your hand .In every aspect this fone is far above the chineese fones.And UI is amazing like you will never get that feeling from any other chinees brand .Amazing fone go for itThink twice before going to choose chineese brand if u r not a gamer .I loved it .

  Do you want an android phone?Do you've a higher perceived brand value for Samsung?Is your budget under INR 13K?If your answer for all of these is YES, then do not wait, just buy it !*** The Processor Debate ***This Snapdragon Vs. Exonys Vs. Mediatek etc, this is all just topics of debate for youtubers. They need content for their channels, don't put your mind in tizzy unless you are a heavy gamer and your life depends on nano-seconds of lag.Yes all these processor debate end at the difference of nano seconds which in real life is even way beyond blink and miss. You can't notice it even if you are Rajnikant. So chose a phone which is VFM for you.*** Perceived Brand Value of Samsung ***Lets just put it out here, Samsung is the Apple of Android world. Right or wrong ? 100% Right !!For me, i always recommended Xiaomi phones to folks who want innovation on a budget. But if you want and Apple but one running Android then Samsung is best bet for you.*** Durability ***Samsung phones are durable and so are even MI phones. I have one Mi A1 still working in mint condition used by my mother. So your decision making should be based on the brand value doe you.*** Battery ***One thing Samsung has learnt for its entry level and mid level offerings is to rightly capture the need. People need large capacity batteries because mobile phone has become one of our limbs, extension of our body part.Added benifit : decent camera , 3.5 mm jack.*** To Summarize ***If you do not want a Xiaomi or Real Me or Moto because you want a SAMSUNG, then go for it, because**** it has massive juice to last**** oh you've a SAMSUNG*** take those ü§≥ selfiesTo suarize

  After several research and watching many you tube videos related to drop test and other stuffs bought this mobile but I regret for buying this mobile, just dropped the mobile by 2 feet height, the so called gorilla  glass broke into pieces. Very worst manufacturing just the brand name is getting marketed and sold but product is of cheap quality. Pls also see the pics of broken glass before you decide to buy. My old redmi note 4 is far better in terms of build quality.

  I have been using a smaller 5"" form factor phone for almost 3-4 years. Had been wanting to buy my next phone for quite some time and finally bought this one.And I would say I'm content with the it.It has a vibrant display best in class I would say. I don't notice the U notch for sometime of usage.Good speaker not something loud but good enough.Good cameras for the price! Some might find the selfie camera less impressive but its good enough for social media needs.Excellent battery! Better than all those 1000$ phones! üòÅAnd the performance is fine enough for me, I get some lags here an there but nothing which makes trouble in my daily tasks. I would say the performance is same as compared to my old phone S6 Edge, which is good as it still runs smoothly! üòÅ Btw, I don't game much!!Perfect to gift it to your mom, dad or anyone in your family. It has good big fonts. And no bogus softwares you might see in other brands!I would say I made a right decision to not invest in a premium phone and saved a lot of money. This phone gets everything done I need and I believe most users will find it good enough too!

  One of the best in market* sAMOLED 6.4 is delivering high satisfaction  Display is big, good, sharp, crisp and clear  enough, Bright colours.  one of the top reason  to go for M21*Dolby atmos gives amplified audio output* Battery is like ocean* Camera is Crystal Crisp* Fast enough* Best in budget* Video experience is just wowBut also know itBody is plastic but glossy , looks goodThe frame finishing does not give a luxurious feel. But a good cover can do that, anyways you will use a cover to protect it. So this reason should no stop you from getting M21.But when you use It, overall performance is going to be satisfying. 200 % recommend this mobile

  Overall the phone is excellent at this price point.  You cannot go wrong with it.The pros1) Superb 6.3"" display with SuperAMOLED : This is really great to have. There are many higher end phones which are pricier, but every time you view on your phone the display is something that goes beyond its segment2) Awesome battery: I believe this is something very important far more than only performance.  Can be a life saver during the occasional instance when you have forgotten to charge it.  Till now  with most never dropped below 30% charge.  Have a reserve charge is good.Also:  The 15W fast charger is fast enough unlike what people believe.  Just don't wait to charge it until its fully discharged.3) One UI on Android 10 and processor performance: Samsuns's OneUI is decent and consistent now across devices. It looks modern and works without lags. Ofcourse its not a gamer or performance phone. But the Exynos 9611 processor is good enough for most tasks for most people.  Also I am sure Samsung will update to Android 11 and maybe even 12.4) Sales and Service: Not much direct experience, but I see that the service center availability is so much better than my previous phone (ASUS Zenfone)5) Signal Reception and SAR: Having a low SAR value is important . WIFi and call reception is excellent. Speaker is loud and clear.Cons:If I have to pick one con for this phone, its the camera. Its average - if I compare it to the ASUS Zenfone 3, a older phone - but then ASUS specializes in the camera area.So camera is average just like most phones at this price point .

  Performance of the phone is good so far. The finger print scanner is is indeed very fast but the best thing I like about this phone is its super amoled display; it is a treat to watch videos on this phone. Camera I personally don't use much, but the quality of front and rear cameras is pretty good especially the night mode which is very helpful in taking pics in low light.Looks good in hand and it is very lightweight which is an added advantage. Now the storage of 128 GB of which 100 gb is at your disposal which practically eliminates the need for external storage for an average user like me. Sound quality is also good and you can listen to your favourite music anytime.The only drawback is battery which as mentioned 6000mAh doesn't seems to be working as long as it should. It still manages to get 36 hours of usage after full charge which takes almost 2 hours with the fast charging feature.Overall considering the price range it is a very good phone with all the necessary features packed in a compact and lightweight device for the average user.

  Never give a chance to regret.. Go ahead...üëçThe Icons looks was not so great .. And then I set'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning üôÇ ).. So I turned off fast charging option..You can do that.. Its will not affect batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 4/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:4.5/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 4/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 4/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now.. but processor is outdated..8. Charging :3.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 3/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamerGaming experience is not that much good butYou can play smoothly.It heats after playing 4 to 5 hours.

  Nowadays Samsung comes up with new phones with different series to reach out to all kind of users.After comparing with different,lastly I go with this particular model as it comes with a full package without a burden to your pocket.üòÅThe camera are really good for portraits and wide angles with a giant battery with very decent UI.Even my 1st phone was samsung S2, after that I loved this brand.Am not a gamer, but this fone is really smooth while handling...

  Its a shame that a phone with such great hardware does not have a competing software to complement it. Its one ui2 is inferior to MIUI found on MI/xiaomi phones IMO. If you're used to MIUI like me then some may be disapointed on software front:-pros:-battery life,camera,fast charger,excellent displaycons:-# no usb 3.1 gen2# no bluetooth 5.1 only(5.0)# no wifi 6 supportsoftware(UI) issues# missing call record option during the call.# missing native app lock feature. This is a big one as third party apps are very poor and MIUI version is great. Samsungs 'S Secure' is a breather but not as good as MI's app lock. you have to unlock each app individually in s secure and install it separately.# if you hide text message content on lock screen it gets hidden when you're logged in as well.# No messages feature which can't detect OTP's in messages.# poor file manager compared to MI and google# no support for showing network speed in status bar# no ability to set daily data limits only monthly limits can be set.# very basic messages app compared to MIUI version# more bloatware and app control than MIUI, can'e even uninstall facebook(only disable).# can't limit the number of connected devices via hotspot.# even taking screenshots is more intuitive and fast in MIUI where you just swipe three fingers down the screen or use the button in notification panel. Samsung uses yet another app for screenshots to which you have to grant permission to save the screenshot although you do not have to install it separately.Most of software limitations can be overcome by installing third party or samsung's own apps. But they will slow the phone down as native(OS) implementations are much faster. Also most of these are small usability tweaks which should not take too much efforts to implement but they will improve the user perception of their phones because many people will install apps for these features and slow their phones down and then blame samsung for building slow phones. Hope samsung is listening to this for their own sake.

  Overall good product from Samsung at cheapest price.For me Samsung is most trusted brand from 2004 untill now.Most impressive part of this phone is it's huge two-three days battery backup.And most attractive S-Amoled display.Great sound quality (better than my old galaxy on8)Clean UI6 GB OF RAM128 GB OF ROMBlue colour looks awesome.And a faster processing unit for gaming and multitasking.At last not the least ""Made in India""Love u Samsung India

  SAMSUNG GALAXY M21(4/64).Design - Subjective(I liked it).Build - Sturdy (but using back case and tempered glass suggested)Battery - 6000Mah around 2 days of battery life and charge time is around 2hrs 30mins if 10% battery left.Camera - Shots are well captured and image processing is good. End result is appreciable.Screen Quality - It's Samsung, need not worry about display. Good colour reproduction in SAMOLED. Nice touch response.Processor - Exynos 9611, this is pretty capable of handling almost every task u throw at it. But don't expect heavy gaming like Snapdragon 800 series. Exynos 9611 is similar to Snapdragon 730.OS - Snappy and didn't face any lags.Network reception - Didn't face any issue with BSNL, Wifi..etc.Audio output - Loud enough in the budget range(around 17k).I would suggest this phone if ur requirement is basic to medium likeWhatsApp, instagram, Facebook, YouTube, entertainment, medium gaming.

  Call quality: The phone serves best as a phone. Excellent sound quality and call quality and handoff over VOWIFI and VOLTE. The person can hear my voice clear as well.Didplay: Feels premium while holding the phone, however not so while looking at it from the back side.Networking: The only catch is the network speed. While other phones connect with 150mbps link speed to my  wifi router this phone connects to 2.4Ghz band at max 72mbps and 5Ghz band at around 400mbps. While tested on 2.4Ghz band, the network speed drops compared to my Huawei devices. On 60mbps connection I am getting 30mbps max while on the Huawei device I am getting 56mbps max. Although call quality is good, network signal strength drops to -80dBm compared to Huawei Honor 6x device @ -60dbm. 4G speed on LTE is also below the Huawei device. Getting 4mbps downlink on this device compared to 15mbps downlink on the huawei device. Wifi signal also drops very often and refuses to connect to the router. Then I have to turn the wifi off and on to be able to connect back. This makes this phone unusable.

  Pros:1. I got this mobile against exchange which was good deal2. I also got approx 1200/ addnl deal wrt bank3. Excellent budgeted smart phone In this price range4. 6.4-inch/Super Amoled/FHD / Resolution (2340 x 1080) and 16M color support5. Triple Camera - 48MP Main Camera +8MP Ultra Wide Camera +5MP and 20MP front camera6. Android with  10.0 operating sys 1.7GHz Octa-Core processor, 6GB RAM, 128GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB and dual SIM- 4GCons:1. It‚Äôs not 5G handset2. Battery Charger is ordinary ( no quick charger) neither wattage is mentioned on charger- disappointing3. Ear phone is not a part of box which is disappointing.4. Face ID not avlble5. Samsung should limit number of apps that comes with handsets. This unnecessarily lowers down the speed as well storage.

  The youtube itself doesn't have 720p,1080p,4k resolution option, also camera quality is very poor. My old phone which had 12 MP pics were betterthe display was better for my old samsung phone itself ,Very bad. Display is not Good, quality is not good even pictures aren't good. Worst experience. Very disappointed with the product. A lot of people have put this phone in olx I thought there was some mistake but the product is not at all good don't go for it and waste it time.Overall Display  and Camera is not upto the mark as mentioned in features.

"

  It's good phone in this range. I am overall satisfied with performance, mentioning some pros and cons for other buyers.Pros- Awesome Camera- Non-Chinese- Samsung Brand- Pre-Installed AppsCons- Battery is not what they claim, my last phone was Asus Maxphone with 5000 mah. Here they claim 6000 mah but it is not giving same backup as 5000 Mah battery phone was giving when it was new.- Touch is not that smooth- Casting (Playing on  my Smart TV) is difficult, you cannot do casting when your hotspot is on.- Speed of data is also slow, same sim giving better signal and data speed in other phone as compared in M-21.

"
"

  After using all most 2wks. Here is my honest opinion.1. Battery does not look at all 6000MH2. If you use mobile for continous 2hr it will heat like anything.3. Touch screen is real slow.4. Though camera quality is ok type but not so impressive in this price segment.5. Taking screen shot is real headache...Overall..Dnt buy it guys.. Dnt know about A series.. but M series is not at all upto mark.

  I had purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB RAM 128 GB on 3rd July. Model is good, sAmoled display good. Battery performance best. Fast Charging good. But the processor not good for gaming. I have installed Asphalt 8 car game, mobile is lagging sometime evenI have 6GB RAM model. You can use mobile for all things except Gaming. I hope Samsung will think on it and changed their mobile processor.

  1. This product has alot of network issues, especially when one uses JIO, as it won't catch the network and internet browsing becomes quite irritating.2. Sometimes i faced alot of slow charging issues also, for eg. In total 20 minutes, it charged overall 0-2%.But sometimes this phone runs smoothly which showing any kind of above mentioned issues. Maybe these could be fixed in upcoming software updates.

  I am ok with looks ,battery SAmoled,UI cus i am using samsung from long ling time, only one time i used Huwaei .I was using A series before this . I wanted a second phone so bought this but disappointed with adaptive brightness. Its hell ...i mean i felt cheated and sad also feel cheap inside my mind that why i bought this phone, as adaptive Brightness is an important factor for me . Adaptive brightness is not happening at all and also very very slow.sometimes not working at all.i never wanted a fully chinese phone , So i bought this one.but a big thumps down, also heard M30s and M30 also have same issues.Samsung its cheap play

  Honestly, my thoughts were divided when I was purchasing this handset. There are so many reviews, so many mobiles and so many features in this price range. And, there are so many different scales to measure performance that it felt like propaganda to promote cheap mobiles.With a leap of faith, I booked this phone. When I opened the box and switched it on, I immediately started feeling better. As I explored it further, I realized that all those marketing gigs are nothing but propaganda.What I purchased is a perfectly blended masterpiece of quality, performance and price.Amazing picture quality with rich color and perfectly balanced contrast; smooth touchscreen without any lags even when all my regular apps are loaded in RAM.Finally I would say, it has completely satisfied my needs. Now, I enjoy playing games in my gaming console but if someone prefers mobile for the same then please read other people's comments for further research.

  Mobile is good..but not extraordinary...even though having 6000mah, battery drains fast.Camera is good. Mobile Charging at par with other normal mobiles.

"
"

  Pros :1. Battery - absolutely monster of a battery. Never ran out of battery in a day even with heavy use. U can just keep ur power bank at your home forever with this.2. Display - Best display in this range. Nothing to argue about that. Media consumption experience becomes top quality because of this. Whether it's YT or Amazon Video or Netflix u can watch it in highest quality.3. Camera - Decent camera. Absolutely ok for normal regular selfies and videos.4. User interface - Awesome experience with the latest UI. Very light, almost like stock android. No unwanted ads or bloatwares. Fantastic.5. Android security updates - U get updates very fast. Probably after google and nokia phones Samsung is the third best in this area.Cons -1.Back made of plastic - Gives it a cheap feel.2. Ok Processor - The processor is not super powerful. It does all regular work and multitasking very smoothly. Also light gaming is ok. But for heavy gamers it's not gonna suffice.

  There were  some  teething  problems  like ""freezing"" within a few days  of receiving  the phone.Upon contacting you, I received a routine reply for my first call of complaint.My special  thanks to your  Service  Executive Neetu who arranged  the technician's visit  to me on 17th Sep.Thanks to your service technician Shiva, who  guided  me through  telephone  from  Guntur city in Resetting  the phone to ""factory reset "" mode.It had helped resolving  the issue.The phone is  working good for now.So, Shiva  did not have  to come to  my town personally.Thanks  Amazon.

  Pathetic phone. It cannot be called a phone because it does not do what a phone is supposed to do - make calls. It keeps getting disconnected everytime you're on a call. The network reception is also pathetic, it cannot receive signal from a tower far away. Every time it gets automatically disconnected the phone cannot connect to the carrier and you have to wait for half hour to make another call. If it seems too good to be true then it is too good to be true. I bought the phone for my mum thinking it has a good battery but what's the point of having a good battery and not being able to make calls?!EDIT: An update fixed almost all the issues for now. We'll see how long it lasts.

"
"

  The device is great at this point.1. Excellent  -  Screen, Camera.2. Average  -  Processor(PES at 60 fps hangs) , Network Connectivity (A little poor at low Connectivity  compared to Redmi and Lenovo devices that I had)3. Bad -  It heats a lot sometimes. Especially  during  Charging,  if you have your hotspot  on, it heats a lot, really a lot. And sometimes, it doesn't,  like its unpredictable.  I think this can be improved  by some software updates pls. This bothers me. Very less heating  while playing  games, but too hot while charging.Update:- The geating problem has resolved significantly  after the last 2 updates . Now  it hardly heats up. Kudos to the Samsung Team.

  Phone is upto the mark according  to  the  price.‚Ä¢Charging is 4/5 little slow but the battery life  is just awesome.‚Ä¢Camera is 4/5 but considering the price  this is  the  best you can get.‚Ä¢Fingerprint  is 4/5 sometimes it doesn't  respond to the finger quickly  but it is  good  as it has quite  fast response.‚Ä¢Display  is just awesome 5/5. With  wideline L1 certification  you can actually  watch  4k videos. If you watch movie/webseries frequently this phone is for you.‚Ä¢This phone is not made for heavy games but it can easily play  less heavy games like subway  surfer etc.Hope this helps :).

  So you wanted to buy a budget Samsung phone and you bought this piece is junk! I wanted to warn you all, this phone will develop problems..I started having touch issues within 3 months. So you go to the service centre and hope they fix it. What you don't know is that the service centre will tell you parts are not available and you will be given full refund in the form of a gift certificate that can ONLY be used in offline Samsung stores! So you'll go and start looking for offline stores only to realise it's only the Samsung smart cafe's that accept the gift certificate. You'll also realise that none of the m-series will be sold offline! Then you are forced to shell out 2k or 3k more to but an A series. This whole thing is a huge scam. Avoid this model and Samsung. They are cheating people

  Phone has heating issues, battery charge takes 2hrs:45mins to get full charge Camera not upto the mark though we have many camera features. Slim and good design, colour is good but cheap quality plastic back mayerial. I didnt like.  Processor compamy promises a powerful chipset. But while playing games, its quality is poor. Lags in Between. Its worst. I'd suggest you to go for realme 5pro in this price range. Overall out of 5 I'd rate 2.2 - 2.5

  If you are planning  to buy Samsung  mobile please  make sure that you are going to suffer by its very poor internet connectivityOverall mobile is impressive  but if you can't connect  with internet  then why you spend in smartphoneInstead of this i would like to definitely  recommend  that you have to go for any other made in india brand i made mistake  and i m suffering  now i have mi and realme with same jio sim and it plays 480p video anytime in home but in samsung m21 you cant even send WhatsApp  msgs its shows sqaure box whit your msgCamera  is goodLow light performance  is poorCamera  could perform  better if there was good optimizationBattery is superb i have used 9hrs and battery  was 10% charging  time is 3hrs or 2hr 50 minScreen is superbFingerprints  sensor  is good and fast 9 out of 10 times it opensTaking Screenshot  is bit problem  palm gesture  isnt working and physical  buttons  are headache you have to use assistant  ballPlastic quality  is something  that you'll  complain  it is below  average  even realme c2 worth 5000 mobile is better than thisOne ui is goodOne last thing you have to really think twice before  buy because  of very poor connectivity  of internet I'm  repeating  and low accuracy of GPS so i think this would help you

  Package was well packed. It doesn't xome with protective film/tempered glass and back case so add +300rs.Phone is lightweight considering its dimensions and 6000mah battery.Finger print is quite fast, camera is very good better than note9pro, note8 pro but i can hardly say that camera is better than note7 pro( which has great sensor + gcam compatablity).Charging is the weak link of m21/m31. Its gets fully charged around 2hour 30mins. Battery life is quite good. You can put it in darkmode to get extra battery life(thanks to a beautiful amoled).Many would argue it is not fast. But 90% dont care about if its loads 2-4 apps 1 sec later than note9pro. OneUI is quite efficient, and taking about UI its way cleaner than RealmeOS, funtouchOS its one the level of OxygenOS (if not better). You'll not see pathetic, adult adds like from shareIT, UC, Mi browsers or realme browser.(Of course you can turn it off but many are just pathetic).And taking about chinese, samsung has closed or shifted many of its manufacturing units from china. And its biggest manufacturing unit is India, and samsung has started manufacturing its flagship smartphone here in Noida. Thus we can say that it's the best brand who is least relies on china.On that Note, ""software in a week , hardware im a year"" - Sonam wangchuk.

  I purchased it in april 2020 in Rs-12699/- But now this same product is Rs- 13999/-. Its very bad impression on SAMSUNG. when every Indian try to NO CHINESE PRODUCT. At the same time SAMSUNG COMPANY cheated middle class people. People will teach you a good lesson in future. Otherwise mobile is good compare to other mobile except Design/LOOK

  After one month of usage i found that in low light front cam is an absolute tragedy.We can see grains while zooming in a pic taken at low light.Night mode in rear cam is also comedy.But in daylight it's a real monster.Dolby feature is only available when headset is plugged in which i didn't feel any difference when turning on/off Dolby Atmos.One thing to mention about this device is its sAMOLED display.It's a real treat to eyes.If you are a series/film addict you should go for it.I can see a whole lot difference between normal lcd display and sAMOLED.No problem with network reception/speed like Qualcomm powered devices.Fast 2 day delivery and packed with powerful battery and processor,fast biometric recognition, i think it is the best budget phone in India now(If you are a photoholic pls avoid this, even i have regrets).Another defect i found is it heats up heavily when we use it under sunlight or use it in closed conditions like car etc.Don't know it's because of sAMOLED display.But sure not it's battery.Thanks seller. 1 star less for bad low light sensor/camera.

  For me bying a budget phone means  never go for cheap Chinese phone, so I always prefer Samsung over other brands. A reliable brand with whom I have long lasting relationship, its like 'Never give a chance to regret'..My realistic opinion1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amoled with full Hd.. Superb Display.3.Design:4/5It has a 6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. I am happy it does not haveglass body and who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers.4. Camera: 4.5/5Both camera pretty good... many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..only lacking Lens stabilisation which would have preferred but keeping in mind this phone is budget phone‚Ä¶5. OS & UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI 2.06.Finger print reader and face lock: 4.5/5Face lock and finger print reader are satisfctory but finger print scanner fumbles occasionall.7.Processor and performance 4/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag and hang till now..8. Charging : 3.5/5.Only adaptive fast charger. Provided with a 15W normal charger only.9. Accessories : 2/5Only Battery charger provided.10.Loud speaker 4/5Loudspeaker sound level is pretty satisfactory for me. One can use ear phones for intricate sounds of music if one wishesVerdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer ...

  Hi... I am from Kerala, aleppy. I am reviewing this #wattamonster samsung galaxy M21 black after one week of my high usage. I am really impressed with the sAmoled screen which couldn't avoid any cost from my 1st level experience. Battery capacity is outstanding and really thankful to samsung for this model. I am financially an average man. So for me it is affordable and am extremely happy with this model. Moreover I am so happy and proud to use a samsung product than any chines product. So finally those who are looking for neat and good camera, body, durable, long-lasting battery and sAmoled screen....just go for it.... No doubt...attaching some of the photographs i took from this phone... I am really happy with this model.

  PRO'S1. Good weight distribution of the phone.2. Amazing screen.3. Best fingerprint reader for this budget, amazingly fast.4. Samsung's one UI is good.CON'S1. 6000 Mah battery stated by samsung but it doesn't feels like. I have previously used 5000 mah phone but this one feels like it has 4000mah approx.If i even used it for normal games like candy crush it does not even last 1 day.2. Worst camera. This is the worst part as many people when buying a mid ranger expects to have a decent camera performance so that they can atleast take good photos for the social media or any other work.BUT the camera performance is so poor that i was disappointed in it.The photos have no clarity when you even zoom in a little bit into the photos.This is very bad coming from Samsung.TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH SAMSUNG.

  I am writing this review after using M21 for a week. And my review is based on truly improved Samsung M series with my best experience1.BUILD QUALITY.Superior, as it matches any S series flagship premium in classy look, strong built for this budget amount.2.DISPLAY & FINGERPRINT.With Samsung SuperAmoled display you can truly trust the amazing view angle. Fingerprint on back is much faster than I expected. It doesn't takes a second also to open. Even FaceUnlock is faster.3 SOUND QUALITY.After using for hours I found the Speaker this time Samsung made is much improved with Bass Stereo which was missing earlier. The in-ear delivers your ear the pure Dolby Atmos with clear precision and crystal clear bass effect.4.CAMERA.This time M series did a great job by giving us a INTELLI camera of 48 mwgapixel with Single Take feature. Samsung gives what it advertises. Which made me to stick to Samsung brand. My usage of Camera is high &  well lit captured shots5.BATTERYMain benefit of this midrange M series is it's maasive 6000mAh battery which gave me enough for nearly 3 days continuously.So I highly recommend everyone who need a budget phone with high specifications need to buy this ..Worth for Money paid..

  A very good battery life. Almost 18% decrease after 4hours of continue usage. Charging time almost 2hr 30min. Earphone sound quality is very very good. Use a good earphone with this phone. And it's super amoled display is more than super. You will feel every video. I can't describe it with words.Camera quality is too good. You can not get this type of camera in any 15k phone. I don't know about gaming but the phone is too smooth to operate. Charging cord is not so long but I don't think this is a major problem. Till now I don't feel any kind of heat. Its microfone is moderate but not bad. It's ok. Almost 15gb Rom is used by system. And listen, kindly update your system as soon as you get this phone. Check it.  A system update is already available which is 450mb in size.At last, at 14k it is an amazing phone. You can go for it.Stay safe guys. Good Luck.

  Excellent phone. Hardware configuration and working are really good. Signal reception, camera are good.One issue with software: Kid's (3-4yr) voices are not being captured by few apps - Live Transcribe, Google Meet, WhatsApp video. Irony is WhatsApp voice recorder is able to capture but not the video. Inbuilt voice recorder is also able to capture (hence my claim that hardware is good). Giving 4 star out of 5 for this reason.Had to return the product only because of this issue. Amazon's service was really good: They first accepted replacement, when the replaced piece had same issue, I placed request for return. Amazon kindly considered it and refunded the entire cost. Thank you!

  Great camera and battery life, and One UI really sweetens the whole experience, BUT...If you search for yellow/tint in comments you'll find many users have noticed the amoled display despite its clarity and contrast has a slight defect and has a red/yellow tint when looking directly at the screen (at 0¬∞), which shifts depending on the angle.For me it is reddish on the top halfDarkmode eases the experience, but once u notice it you can't unnotice it and its very hard to get over it. Most users would be blown away by an AMOLED clarity and contrast and might not notice it.It is a common defect found in cheaper Samsung panels.Unless ur OK with unnatural color tint on ur screen, I would recommend AGAINST buying this phoneGoing to send mine for a replacement... I'll update what hapoens

  Writing my review after 3days of usage.Excellent mobile in this price range.Display quality is awesome.48mp rear camera & 20mp front camera excellently do their job.RAM & ROM is sufficient as I'm a average  mobile user.I dont play games in mobile so not sure about the gaming experience.I was hearing songs and saw 2 movies for a full battery charged.  Battery charging speed is also good, took around 2.5 hrs to full charge. Dint felt the heat as seen in MI.Video & Audio quality is superb. Dolby Atmos plays a fair role in the Audio quality.Touch sensitivity is accurate with the Cornered gorilla glass which gives good safety for display screen.Overall it's a very good quality budget mobile with awesome configuration in this price range.

  A good photos which decent performance in all segments like battery backup, camera, display etc.  i purchased this for my mother and she is quite happy with her phone.Samsung phones generally have a very low SAR value  and thus they are a very good options for you of you are planning for buying for your loved ones.Here are my top reasons to choose Samsung over others chinese products which are offering so much in this price range1) S.Amoled ( because this is the most used features atleast for my mother she have nothing to do with performance etc)2) Low SAR Value ( Samsung provide the lowest SAR value in mobile market)3) No Android Ads ( unlike Realmi/redmi where ads are a major problem and sometimes they are very inappropriate to scroll in public)And thats it, however if you are gamer or camera lovers thans this is not your cup of team better look for other options in this price segment.

  Like - Samsung UI experience was very good, enjoyed using as it is my first Samsung phone. Enjoyed watching movies & youtube. Colours are vibrant.Dislike -Camera - very badIt does not have stabilization. Image processing is pathetic. 48mp (rear) & 21mp (front) is just a gimmick. You just cant have good a picture, as it completely changes the photo texture. (I had Motorola X Play with 21mp as rear camera and used it for 5 years, picture taken were very good. If we zoom it, it would provide with very good details). May be some would be interested in getting picture which are soft texture rather than more of natural image, those can give a shot at this phone.Video - Just forget of taking a good video! No stabilization and keeps blurring.Battery - Not good.Handset which I have got, I have observed that if I use phone with Wifi - it works around 1-2 days based on my use. But, when I use mobile network then I see that phone does not even last a 12 hours with general use such as browsing, streaming (I dont play games so I wont comment on battery life for games).Opinion - If you really want to buy this phone, first you check this phone personally with someone who is already using it and then buy it. I have seen many good reviews about this phone, so above points which I have written is based on my experience with this handset. If you want to buy Samsung, I would say go for A series such as A50s or A51 or A71 depending on your budget. If you dont have budget (like I had constraint) and want to go with Samsung then you will have to live with its cons.Note - There is no return option, you can get replacement but that will be a task for you.

  This phone is only best for battery and nothing else. The camera is not so good as compared to the other phones in this price segment. The audio output from the speaker is very low, even samsung has mentioned that it has Dolby Atmos which enhances the audio output but whenever I put the Dolby Atmos function ""on"", There is no audio enhancement, such a poor audio output quality from both speaker as well as the 3.5 mm earphone jack. Also, the body build quality is very bad and cheap. Samsung mentioned that it has L1 support for the HD video content but whenever watching hd quality video even on the youtube, it degrade video quality form high to low resolution. And at the end, with such bad impression while holding and operating this phone, feel that the price of this is much high. It should be around 8k to 9k only for the quality they are selling. Go for the Nokia phones, they are far better than all these kind of phones.

  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month.1) fingerprint sensor is not that good as of oppo / vivo / moto. Sometimes it may takes 2-3 attempts to open the phone with fingerprint sensor.2) camera quality is great of back side. But front camera is not as much good as it says of 20 mega pixel. In proper lights front camera works excellent.3) there's no as such hanging but sometimes it start lagging for a second or few.4) sound quality is decent.5) the back cover of phone is of plastic material so after using it for a month with backcover though, there are few scratches.6) there is inbuilt hidden space in the phone in which you an hide photos or videos . But there is no security lock facility. So you can create a hidden folder but indirectly it's of no use as anybody can just open it by going to gallery settings.7) battery life is excellent.  And yeah takes time in charging but it's 6000mh battery. I'm a non gamer person, so in my case once a battery gets fully charges the phone works for around 1.5 day efficiently.Final remark :- it's is a decent phone from Samsung in this price range. Although if you are okay to buy Chinese phones than there several other phones also which you can find good in this price range.

  After 3 days of using here is my review-1. Battery is Good even though I am heavy user it's holds fine.2. Camera isn't good it simply isn't and if you are thinking about downloading Gcam here is the bad news, Gcam doesn't support exynos.3. I don't know about gaming as I don't play games so you can check it on YouTube.4. Build quality is really good even though it's plastic.5. It's a nitpick but I wish it had gorrila glass 5 instead of 3.6. Screen is beautiful. My sister bought redmi note 8 and let me tell you the difference between them is real, Amoled is really different.So overall it's a phone for people who want a battery life, decent camera(I guess), and good performances with beautiful screen at only 12699.

  Hi,I switched to samsung brand after using MI phones after current against china situation. Overall Product is good.below are my comments.1. Back panel body is of plastic which gives premium look but at the same time shows fingers marks.2. Camera quality is descent.3. Battery is 6000 MAH but need to recharge on daily basis without playing any games, only accessing emails and whatsapp chats4. Front screen touch feels feathersoft.5. Finger print sensor does its job very smoothly6. Problem with data, my other phone shows all 4 network bar (Full coverage) however after inserting same sim in this phone, I never seen it went more than 2 bars. Also phone's data connection gets OFF after receiving voice call even after I kept ""Use mobile data during calls"" option ""ON"" (major problem). I asked samsung customer care, but still problem is the same..Samsung needs to work on this.About replacement:I got phone replaced with in 2 days, But again the same issue with the phone, however using same SIM in REDMI phone it works perfectly for network bar and connectivity. Need refund for the same, Very disappointed with the product.

  I'm using 6GB/128GB Variant of this device from last three days, so my review will be on the basis of 3 days experience with the device and I will update it after I spend more time with the device.0. Design & Build - I prefer a good looking phone but this phone is simple in looks, simple look doesn't mean bad look but it is not very good looking also. Fingerprint is given at the back of phone and phone is built by using plastic material & I got two scratches on the backside so please order a back cover when you order phone as there is no backcover in the box. Display is protected by gorilla glass 3.1. Camera - I'm not a selfie lover but I use camera in daily life for clicking images of receipts, flowers and some random pics of different objects. Sometimes the camera will give you very good results if there is proper lighting but some shots are noisy if I talk about camera quality. Front camera clicks well also. Night shots are not great but considering budget it's okay as every phone struggles to click good pictures in night. If you want to install GCAM then it is not supported very well in this device, there are many mods but functions don't work properly.2. Display - You will get best display in this price range with this device, great for media consumption.3. Performance - I'm not a gaming person but I use a lot of apps in smartphone, I have installed around 30+ apps in my phone but didn't face a lag in opening & switching the apps till date. I don't know about gaming performance of the device.4. Software - It runs on Android Q(10) with heavy customizations from Samsung who calls it One UI 2.0. There are a lot of bloatware apps pre-installed in the device but the good news is you can either uninstall them or disable them. The UI is very intelligently designed and feels very smooth & engaging. It's colorful & feature-rich. You can use dual apps and always on-display is a good feature that I'm using now. Explore the phone settings and you will get to know more of the exciting features present on this phone. But honestly I loved the UI designed by samsung. I'm using a Samsung device for the first time in my life & I'm happy about the software. It's very easy to use.5. Battery - Battery takes approx. 3 hours to fully charge but after a charge you can easily expect a 1-2 day battery life with mixed usage. Battery life is really good on this smartphone.6. Fingerprint reader & face unlock are really very fast & accurate most of the times.So my suggestion is if you need a smartphone with great display, good software, good camera, very good battery life then go for it but If you prefer good build quality with good looks , very high gaming performance or a very great camera device you can check other options. I will update the review If I notice something really good or bad about the device later but for now I'm more than happy with this device.

  Writing this review after using for more than one month. Pros- smart slim looks, awesome display, touch function very smooth, great camera quality, user friendly camera features, processor os etc of latest versions, fingerprint reader working fineCons- Battery is problematic in terms of Charging time & Overheating. After using for one month I find that it takes 3hours or more to be charged full(from 8% to 100% it took 3hrs 10mins) everytime. I dont understand what is the point of giving a Fast charger then! Battery survives one 24-30 hours with moderate to heavy use, which is fine. But the charging time is too much. Also, it gets heated quite often if you have kept your data on, after few mins of turning off data it cools down. It may be possible I unfortunately received one product with problems, but, yes, my dissapointment over this one battery issue outdid its all other good features.

  I have just used it for three days, but I had to tell you it's an amazing phone. It's  a great phone in the mid range though MI has a better variant at lesser price but hey stay away from China. Coming back to the phone the fingerprint sensor is great, display is mindblowing , battery backup great, camera is decent enough for me though when you compare to redmi's variant little below par.

  I must admit that samsung is now selling good quality phones at 15 to 20K range. Previously i booked poco X1 , which I didnt find very good as one of my friend has that. I got this at 15.2K , 3K cheaper than the poco.I think for someone with similar budget can choose this phone over poco, xaomi or honor bcoz it has exynos 9611 that is a good processor , excellent picture quality (although some may say that i doest have 4 camera but i find picture quality of all the phones with 2 or more camera as same),128/6 memory and sAMOLED is the real deal maker.And whats more samsung phones have higher working life - they easily lasts for 18 to 24 months(my previous phone, samsung A50 running perfectly since April 2019 without even a minor issue) and resale value is good as well.Good luck !!!!

  This is the best thing which has been done in MID RANGE mobile phone till date. You won‚Äôt believe; where other phones struggle to keep them alive till day end and you have to put charger on. It is left with so much of juice that it needs charging only the next day in the morning after 10 AM. I am an office goer who needs battery backup which lasts more than 24 hours, my M21 outperform there. With easily operative blue light filter mode this does not give any strain on my eyes even when I use continuously for more than 2 hours. It is the safest gadget to be used by my children to save their tender eyes.All Samsung M21 mobiles are manufactured in India only which gives me a pride.In a Nutshell:1. Has 6000 mAH monster battery for one and half daylong performance2. Super Smooth Android 10 with One UI3. Very Powerful exynos 9611 processor4. Dedicated SD Card support.5. sAMOLED Screen with the best display in the segment undoubtedly6. 48 MP Highly Capable primary cameras which is way better ahead of its competitor both for day and night shoots7. 20MP Selfie camera ‚Äì which acts as wefie

  Camera will not disappoint.Battery average despite large size.Screen quality amazing - excellent.Finger lock is quick.Best thing no chinese brand.

  What makes me Smile.1) Good Battery, single charge will last you the entire day, Medium usage.2) Good screen, very clear and good picture quality.3) Processor is fast and multi tasking is smooth.4) Camera, is good and takes clear and accurate pictures.What makes me Sad.1) Starts getting heated easily, you can observe higher heat levels next to the camera. Hope this does not create a bigger issue.2) The curved grip is slippery, if you don't hold the phone properly, you will drop it.3) The box that it came in looks very suspicious, the stickers can easily peel off or put back. Price and bar code.

  Nice smartphone with great Battery, Camera and fingerprint reader.It's obviously better than Xioami(Redmi) smartphones because it never heats up like Xioami smartphones.It has a great Battery Backup.We Indians mustn't buy smartphones from chinese companies as they are useless and are not reliable as samsung.Believe me it's better than redmi note 8 pro( I am saying this as I have bought both).When I went through the product description of redmi note 8 pro I thought it might be a better smartphone than samsung galaxy m-21 or m30s but I was proved wrong when I bought samsung galaxy m-21.At last I want to say redmi smartphones are better in description section only and samsung smartphones are good in reality.Don't just buy a smartphone by going through the product description section

  **A Big NOO for Gaming!(4GB varient).ASPHALT 9 lags very bad at High setting and even on Low settings the Gameplay is not Smooth. SIMCITY (pretty basic game) is not smooth,frequent Lags.**UI(2.0) is Neat n Clean but NEEDS MORE OPTIMIZATION in M21.There are lot of Frame Drops or  Lags between switching apps,Loading Apps,etc.Sometimes Phone take more time to process things than usual (sometimes only) like unlocking phone.**Rest everything is good like Battery Display.

  Bought this phone for my mother & we are really happy with it. The battery very easily lasts her 2+ days . She mostly uses it for whatsapp, general browsing & YouTube videos. The back camera is really good. It takes about 3 hours to a full charge & a lot of people complain about its slow charging speed but thats fine as a 6000mah battery at 50% is almost equivalent to any 3000mah phone. The built quality is very decent & the OS is smooth as butter. Love this one by samsung as I wanted to avoid redmi phones for their shady advertisements OS. Would recommend this whole heartedly! Well done Samsung !

  Not at all acceptable Camera output from Samsung when they charge higher prices than others.Trust me my Vivo V9 Pro with main camera 13+2mp & front 12mp camera produced far better images than this M21's 48mpI also have Realme5pro - 48mp camera phone - and I just cant imagine to compare its photos with M21's.I seen 100s of videos on YouTube which shows M21 vs M31 camera comparison - and most of they said M21 & M31 produce 95% same results. Thank God I didn't wasted more 2k on M31 if it was to give the same photos.( I decided to buy a NON CHINESE BRAND - so bought M21 - though I know this mobile's 90% parts would hvae been from China üòÇ)Strictly NO for M21 if you want nice camera results.on the top it takes 2+ hours to charge 100% from 15-20%. (thanks to 15W slow Fast charger in this price)Other good points -Battery is big so obviously it will last long ( and anyway you will not going to use camera much so it will save more battery üòú)LED display and touch is smooth - as you expect from Samsung.UI is clean and simple

  Thank you Samsung, for giving such a wonderful phone in an affordable price.The Super Amoled, brings display to life, the sound quality with good earphones is a watching treat.The camera is superb in day time & well lit areas. Night mode is impressive too. I actually gifted this to my brother, who is an all day gaming freak. He loves this M21, though he used to charge 2 to 3 times his previous mobile in a day. This phone goes for him all the day fully. Thank you Samsung, cheers!!, becoming our favourite brand back again, I feel.

  A very good phone at this budget. You may get some fancy specs at same price from Mi or any other chinese manufacturer but the differentiating factors are screen, battery & camera.  Samsung AMOLED screens are the best in phones. You simply can't get a better screen from any other vendor. You only can compare with another samsung phone.  Battery of 6000 mah last sa min of 2 days even for a heavy user. Camera is very good. Face unlock works very well.  Only cons i experienced was that with all the gear like case and temper glass it looked a bit bulky. But larger screens have become a norm and that's manageable to me.

  Very good superb,  non chineese and branded good camera mind blowing  pictures 48mp main and triple and also more clear samsung camera with 4k videos and super slomo i really like it, more clarity pictures than samsung and amazon  sample pics, sAmoled display very good display nothing to find better than this, 20mp selfie camera good quality,  good sound quality  dolby atmos awesome 6000 mah unbelievable  i think it is better than apple and other chineese xiaomi, vivo, oppo , real me, blindly purchase m21 it is best alrounder surely,  compared to specifications this is very low price i think 30,000 is reasonable price for this specifications  in samsung

  Excellent for watching movies and hearing music. SAMOLED and Dolby atmos are above average. Night photography is poor although daylight photography is satisfactory. Battery life is good but doesnot support quick charge. Max is 1.5amp is what I got. Nor Samsung provided 3amp fast charger. It was 2amp charger out of the box. No hanging or heating issues and all sensors work well.

  My previous device was Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. By the time I bought this, Realme 7 was launched on flash, which in anyone's first look would be the best favourite in 15k range of smartphones. I never wanted to buy a Chinese made UI phone, the same reason why I bought Max Pro M1 more than 2yrs ago. Not because of this fake nationalism media furore, but because I genuinely care about my privacy. I always appreciate true Android OS experience, with the freedom to control my apps and settings. Why I'm writing about these things? Let's see.1. Samsung Galaxy M21 comes with its One UI 2.0, which has been recently updated to 2.1 with some camera improvements. It offers exactly same freedom to control app's permissions, check individual battery usage, use themes and feels better than the cheaper looking MiUI and RealmeUI.2. It comes with Samsung Max VPN function and I'm quite content with it. It saves me a lot of resources to not invest in a VPN subscription. However, it's slow and makes the browsing experience sluggish - story of every VPN ever existed. Still it's okay from privacy p.o.v.Now coming to the device's performance and features, I do not think I need to write much about it after 6 months of this device launch. I will simply post a 1-10 rating for each perspective.Performance: 7 (Occasional hiccups)Display: 9 (You already know about this)Ergonomics: 9 (Don't believe those saying its design looks outdated)Memory: 8 (in terms of multitasking)OS/Software: 9Rear camera: 7Front camera: 8Video capture: 8Battery: 10 (You might have already seen this coming, Gives me 10-12h screen usage)Miscellaneous - Face unlock & Fingerprint sensor: 9, Audio output from speaker: 7, Bluetooth connectivity: 7, WiFi reception: 9, Call through earpiece: 8, Body material: 6 (for using such a slippery plastic back), Heat dissipation: 4 out of 10The major issue I had handling this phone was due to this getting heated on the upper side of display, most probably due to a bad conductor of heat at its back. I haven't played a single game and I've stopped playing games on a phone long ago, so it's just the many shopping, social media apps and browsers that I multitask between. I ordered a flip cover along with the phone since AMOLEDs are thin glass, needs care while handling, but I couldn't use this phone with the flip more than a day! The upper part of display was heating up like a metal kept in sun. Such heating systems can permanently harm the motherboard and battery elements inside, along with your ears if you take calls at such times. I have also used my friend's Galaxy M20 and even that outdated device with 3GB RAM or so and a bad processor has better heat management.It gets mildly heated while keeping in the pocket, while charging, while multitasking a lot between social media and content downloading apps, every now and then even though I'm not a rough or heavy user. My screen usage a day stays within 6-9 hrs. I returned the flip and ordered a soft plastic back cover with a fabric design (You can get it at 149 from Amazon, it has holes on the back for air venting) but even that couldn't make it through more than 10 days of usage. Initially, it was handling heating fine but after a few days I again noticed similar heating issue. I returned it again and now I have ordered a plastic case, which simply holds it on edges and open on the buttons side and upper and bottom sides, hopefully for better ventilation. Doing fine since laat 2 days of use, but this doesn't provide any protection to display. It's just that I happen to be very cautious while handling my gadgets so I know it will survive for years in my hands. I never encountered such heating issues in my Asus Max Pro M1 with a metal back and rugged cover over it, even during heavy gaming and multitasking. It was there but on very rare occasions though. I have seen Samsung India responding to reviews here so, take a Note, Samsung.Verdict: I'm posting this on 2nd Oct, and I think still looking at the competition of the kind of products in this range, M21 is a good buy. If you can manage with the heating issue, which if you use with a partially-open back cover (the one in pic) or without any cover at all, won't be there. I wanted a phone I don't need to run for a charger every now & then, it checks that point quite well.Leave a Like to this review if you think this helped you choose a better option. Cheers.

  I bought it for my brother @12699 on 24 May 2020So, I will list the most practical things I like about this device.* I personally care more about the screen of a device, be it mobile, Laptop or computer monitor. As whatever you consume, it comes through that screen only. AMOLED screen make the visual experience so much rich, plus it consumes lesser battery from a already monstrous one. This is the main reason for me to go for this device. I would always recommend anyone to pickup an AMOLED screen over a LCD one* Bloatware free Android distribution, as good as Android one stock. No ads like you will find many in Chinese Handset. If I have to gift a mobile to my family member. I pick android one or a equivalent clean OS device, like this one.* Most intuitive UI in android, Samsung's One UI. (Yes, you must get hands-on with Samsung's one UI device toexperience it). The way they have made it possible for users to navigate to the items with single hand is what even Google couldn't do after so many years. That too, when phone screen sizes are 6.x inches nowadays. The UI is very responsive and day to day experience is glitch free* This devices comes with a big battery and with 6.4 inches screen and phone doesn't feel bulky. Also, battery compartment, you don't even need any review for that. Backup of 2.5 days under normal usage very much possible* Great camera for your day-to-day moments. Night mode really makes a difference. Can capture and see lightning at 240fps, the same thing I do on my much expensive Galaxy S9* Feature rich phone. Video editor, Photo editor, movie maker are out of the box from Samsung itself. Very useful app which people often download from unreliable third party vendors**********Some downsides************ Not for heavy gamers. However, PUBG is possible in HD settings, if you can play it in India ;)* Today, you might get a 90Hz display at this price. But again, if I have to pick between refresh rate and AMOLED, I personally will pick AMOLED* 15 W fast charging. Needed more W's for a 6000mah battery*********Who all can look for this device***********************Anyone who cares for rich visual experience, rich media consumption, casual gaming, forget to charge their device, need good camera and most important good value of their money.

  Reviewing it after using for more than 10 days. Samsung galaxy M21 is very handy and classic looking mobile and light weight as well even though having huge mah battery.Features like 48 MP excellent camera, super amoled display, and 6000 mah huge battery in this price range is considerable. Processor is also great ( You can Play PUBG, COD smoothly) though Snapdragon processor is obviously better than Exynos for games. I loved the display most. Fingerprint reader is fast no issues at all. Other supplimentry features are also useful, no ads like Redmi mobiles show. Camera is far better than other mobiles in this price range and most attractive features is 'Night Mode'. Battery life is more than one and half day to 2 days depending on uses. Only thing I didn't not like that with 6000mah battery Samsung giving 15 Watt charger, very strange thing. No other issues I noticed like lagging, heating etc.So finally my conclusion is that if u are a normal user(not a gamer) and want a super amoled display, good camera, huge battery and good looking mobile then this is a perfect mobile for you in this price segment.

  My first non-chinese smartphone.üòÄ( In fact Matter of pride for me).Good product but Samsung need to do some more QC about fit and finish(however improvement over M30s).Lack few features compare to counterparts(Gorilla Glass 5, metal/GG5(not my favorite) back cover) but has some exclusive great additions too (sAmoled, 6000 mAH). So it's a give and take. However one can not compete with those who are known tech. thieves.Comes with lot of uninstallable bloatware(Facebook/Netflix/MS cloud to name a few).A daily data counter (usages info.) in notification drawer and a icon to lock screen display is a necessary inclusion Samsung must think about.Processor is good contrary to general belief. Can handle some pretty heavy apps which SD 636 (RN5P) couldn't handle with same memory config.( PS:I am not a Gamer).Overall impressed. My next phone will also be a Samsung when my other phone(RN8P) completes its threshold.Will update my review once return period is over/ after a month's use)And Samsung please care to add a cheap plastic cover and screen protector. Will be life saver till one buys a good one.

  Writing the review after usage of 40 daysPros1. Awesome battery life, lasts up to 48 hrs of decent usage.2. Super amoled display makes visuals more crispy in indoors.3. Camera hardware is good, camera software of Samsung requires update.. overall a good camera.Ultra wide angle is really wonderful. Front camera is decent.4. Processor is good, with 6 GB RAM hardly any lag in using multiple applications simultaneously.5. Samsung UI is lighter than miui and certainly holds all the features like coloros or miui.6. Preinstalled apps hold about 17 GB in phone and rest abt 103 GB available for usage.Cons1. Battery takes about 160 mins to charge fully with fast charger.2. Screen is prone to scratches , a screen guard is must.3. Back cover is needed as the back is all plastic and gets scratches even inside the cover due to small dust particles... Should have a glass back panel as well.4. Fingerprint sensor takes some time , and difficult to sense if your fingers are moist.OverallValue for money, a good option of you are looking for a non Chinese phone with decent configuration and don't have a budget for an iPhone.

  When I purchase this phone then network problem in phone and phone is going to overheat ,then I request for refund and next day the touch of phone was not working,and I contact with Amazon customer service.the agent say on this day you say problem that like network issue and overheating and now you say the touch is not working,your pickup is depend on pickup agent not Amazon , but I say why? Then not respond from Amazon while not a phisical damage or problem its logical problem and Amazon should pickup the item . Any one help me please.

  It's been over a month since I have been using the phone.Camera : Camera performance is not that great. Don't expect any exceptional performance. I find camera of Poco F1 was great when compared. Overall gives a decent performance. Don't pick if you are buying phone just because of camera.Battery: Battery performance is excellent. Initially It struggled to last even one day but then I removed a lot of pre-installed apps and the performance increased. It would last for a day for a heavy user (not gamings all the time Ofcourse, but social apps).Ram/Performance:I do have plenty of apps, yet it works smooth.This phone comes up with a lot of preloaded apps, you may remove some but won't be able uninstall all apps (e.g. Netflix).Overall it's a decent deal at the price coming from Samsung.

  Excellent - amoled screen, speaker volume, camera, no problem in network coverage, battery backup is awesome (1.5 - 2days), design and quality. Trust me you wont regret, buying this phone. Thanks Amazon & Samsung

"
"

  Product is good.Camera is average. Night shot is below average considering price.Build quality is very poor using cheap plastic material, back cover not included.Battery life about 1.5 days.Face unlock is good.Network reception is low, good if your area has high network otherwise you may face issue while traveling.Delivery of product by Amazon is average this time I faced.Processor is lillte low compared to Snapdragon.Amoled display quality is only main point and it is very good with bright and punchy colors.It's proximity sensor is not work well.Charging takes time with 15w fast charger included in box.#Conclusion-Go for #Vivo_U20 in my opinion. You can see comparison video in youtube. It has sd675Aie processor with best camera quality not high resolution but gives better output. Also has 5000 mah battery with fast charging.Thnak you..

  Very pathetic experience. Within one month its screen freezed and sometimes opens functions automatically. I visited customer support service, they upgraded the software and it begins to work properly but after returning from service centre the same problem occurred again.I have used five smart phones previously and was happy but this one scattered all my concept regarding this brand. I recommend not to buy this.After experiencing costumer care support I'll edit the review again.

  I m a fan of Samsung mobile phones and the sound quality is very good ,camera clarity outstanding

  Best Phone at this price pointJust go for it blindly.Before I purchased a Samsung M30s which was a Gamechanger from Samsung.This one is the small brother of M30s.Same features at just 14k.

  I don't what Samsung is thinking before sending this smartphone it's a worst I have ever seen I think they didn't even check this smartphone for one's this phone front camera is totally useless and now we r facing problem and won't able to return thisAfter a long process finally we got replacement of our phone now it is working properly and overall good phone

  Not satisfied with samsung galaxy m21.1. Charging problem, this is fast charging but when connected to charger not connected every time. You have to look time to time if it is charging or not.2. Battery back up is well but not as 6k mAh.3. Fingerprint is not fast every time.4. Touch is not also working well every time.5. Sometimes while playing YouTube light dropped automatically that makes me disappointed.6. Slight hanging problem that is negligible.7. Camera quality is good.8. Display  is also good.9. If software updates available and it makes the changes that need then it'll be a batter than others phone.Over all if you are a mi users you'll find it as back dated. So many features are like old though these are very useful features. But at the same time advance features are also available  in this phone. However the matter it's the best when you are fighting against the Chinese products.

  I was looking for a phone for my mom with the below requirements in the exact order of priority:1. Non Chinese2. Good battery life3. Decent display4. Performs reasonable well5. Decent cameraAnd if I had to review it, I'd buy it for those exact reasons too. The battery is a beast. You just cannot drain it in a day. She charges it once in 2-3 days. Camera is average at best. I'm using a poco which clicks much better images even though it is a 2 year old camera in comparison. Comes with a lot of bloatware preinstalled by Samsung which is mostly removable. And the display is just stunning. Amoled feels so much better. It gets very bright and comfortable to use under direct sunlight. Perfect phone if raw performance is not your priority. Perfect for non gamer patriotics. By far the best phone by samsung value for money

"
"

  I am posting this review upon using this device for 5 days.-Camera is ok, I would like to mention ""Megapixels "" doesn't work if you really don't have the quality camera, but for the money what you pay it's okay to bare üòú-Display is pretty decent-Battery is a monster yet it takes time to fully charge 3hrs needed from 20% to 100%, but you won't have to search for a charger for whole day(I am not a gamer hence don't know how it will work with gamers )If you are really looking for a budget friendly phone go for it.

"
"

  This one was choosen just not to buy any Chinese brand as more features at a lesser price were available by popular Chinese brands.But then surprised to see the camera performance even in low light. Battery nothing to mention, its 6000mah. Software smooth, i am not a gamer but heavy user of phone but have not faced any lagging so far even with 512 GB memory card installed, no hitting issue so far, charges fast reasonably but this could have been little faster. Display resolution one of the best compare to its competitors. Signal reception needs little improvement.

"
"

  I will write it very crisp. Overall it is a value for your money. Wifi calling is a breakthrough  technology.  Even in case of no network, you will enjoy hassle free incoming and outgoing  calls.Only one thing negative about it is , it doesn't  record wifi calls; neither automatically  or manually. It is a small thing I hope they will fix it soon.

  Display 10/10Build 8.5/10Camera 9/10Battery 10/10UI or OS  9/10Chipset performance 8/10 (not good for hardcore gamers)Heating performance 8/10 ( normal temperature on a higher side)Signal strength, call quality 9.5/10Value for money 10/10Recommended ? Surely go ahead, if you are not going to play pubg full time on it.

"
"

  This is gonna be a long review,so buckle up.PROS:Display- Super Amoled FHD+ display,need I say more?The always on display is great.Battery-6000mah.Will surely last you a day with even heavy usage.UI - This comes with android 10 and one UI 2.0 out of the box.Its clean and user friendly.No adds unlike some Chinese phones.Camera-Not mindblowing but fairly decent.The 48 MP camera captures good detail.Samsung branding-The phones quite light weight and ergonomic and the Samsung branding goes a long way.Cons:Charging:It comes with a 15 watt charger which is not fast enough for a 6000mah battery.It takes around 2-3 hours to charge completely.Performance-The exynos 9611 will not disappoint you for daily use but for hardcore gamers it falls short.Overall I would say M21 is a good midranger,and I would recommend a case.

"
"

  Its a great smartphone no doubt!Looks really good, screen is impressive afterall it's Samsung's AMOLED.Camera is 9/10 according to me.Clean UI with lots of features.Battery is HUGE, phone is lightweight keeping in mind its 6000mah!You will surely need a screen guard and back cover before you start using it.I bought it for my mother and she loves it. Got it for 11k in exchange for my old Galaxy On7 prime (‚Çπ3,000)Samsung over Chinese brands any day!

  The phone is a good choice in this price segment. It ticks most of the boxes. Will be a great buy unless you care for heating or gaming. I'm posting this review after 2 weeks of use.1. PERFORMANCE: Multitasking is fast. No lags faced anywhere.2. UI: Fast, customizable and sleek UI.3. CAMERA: Primary camera is good. Wide angle and portrait lens are above average. Edge detection is sometimes not good. Selfie camera works fine.4. DESIGN :Design is good but build quality is not up to the mark as its plastic.5. HEATING ISSUES: The phone gets warm slightly over the selfie camera region even with normal usage. It get a hot during minimal gaming or when using camera even for a short time or when brightness is high. Even whem charging the mobile gets heated.6. BATTERY: Battery backup is great. In 7 hrs of usage including an hour of gaming the battery drops from 100 to 30. Charging takes 3 hrs approximately.7.  GAMING PERFORMANCE: For gaming the phone is not the best in its segment but could manage games at average quality.8. BIOMETRICS: Fingerprint reader and face unlock are fast and didn't face any issues.9. DISPLAY: With super amoled screen, the display is awesome.10. SOFTWARE UPDATE: It runs only in the February version of security and not yet received any update.11. SPEAKER: Speaker is loud. Quality above average.12. CALLING: Call quality is average. Mic is not good and you have to talk a bit loud so that the other person can hear you clearly.13. ACCESSORIES:Note that you do not get a cover or a headphone with the mobile.

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is the best budget smartphone, the display is outstanding, performance is stable, OneUI is highly optimized, the battery is amazing (I read some negative comments, but honestly I didn't face any such issue. It lasted 2 days for me on moderate use.), Fast charging not too fast but better for longer battery life, too fast charging kills the battery faster.Overall it is the recommended smartphone to all the budget users. If you are planning to just heavy game on it then this is not for you.

"
"

  Cons:1. Despite 6000 mAh battery it hardly gives 1 day backup when using for calls only. But taking 3hrs to full charge.2. I noticed twice SIM card not detected.3. Sometimes finger print scanner doesn't work.4. Image/Video quality is not good when using wide angle sensor and video stabilization.5. Sound quality is not up to the mark.7. Polycarbonate metal quality looks like cheap.Pros:1. Awesome display.2. UI is also good.I think I got defective mobile, overall I'm not satisfied with this mobile, return requested, will get replacement. I will post my reviews once I use replaced unit.

  Superb smartphone,i purchased Samsung smartphones only bcoz i dont wanna purchase any Chinese smartphon.boycott Chinese products.Nice smartphone with big battery & good camera.Samsung should introduce there smartphones some other powerful processor like Snapdragon 720G,730G.other all things are good like it comes with super amoled display and ,6000 mah power full battery although if samsung could provide atleast 20 watt charger instead of 15 watt than it will be good. By the way nice phone.i purchased 64gb internal,4gb ram Variant at 13500 rps  now its price has been increased l.now this is available at 14000 for 4gb ram,64 gb internal Variant.samsung should not increase the price.

"

  very fluid, very responsive, very optimized.Although it miss on call recording, focus lock in video, lack of gestures.Othe than that lots of features and highly capable.Display is very very Good.fingerprint scanner is very fast.Battery life is very good and fast charger also works fine.highly recommended .most important point , its not Chinese.

  I was a MI user since decade this time searching for Non-Chinese brand and after searching for almost 2months found this charming device. I is amazing in all respect i.e. Bigger Battery life, best Camera, superfast processor and good looking too.Thanks Samsung for such a amazing device & amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  After using my new M21 6B +128 Gb for 10 days found it just average. Camera quality is low, after 4x zoom images get highly blurred, battery stay for 16-20 hours after moderate usage, phone is bulky, rest features are just ok as getting 6 Gb Samsung phone under 15k is just fine. Was using A 50 from last 2 years which has far better user performance.

  Awesome monster by Samsung. I love this piece with all superb features. With all great features, the following are the pros and cons of the device as I found out.Pros:1. Samsung Hardware Quality! Always exceptional. I remember using my Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300. I still have it and I can match the quality of M21 with that of S3. The price is also reasonable given the features. Could be a bit low.2. Huge 6.4"" Super Amoled screen with >92% screen ratio and 1080x2340 pixels resolution is awesome. Colours and resolution is very good.3. 48 MP camera comes with awesome features like slow motion, super slow motion, time lapse, portrait, food photography, night,  panorama, and pro mode. It also includes qr code scanner and bixby vision. Video quality is also awesome. Front selfie camera is also excellent with self capture features by palm gesture. Front camera is also used for face recognition for unlocking the phone, which is again an excellent feature. Tripke camera have wide mode, depth mode and normal mode.4. Battery: 6000 mAH Lithium Polymer battery gives a monsterous backup. Even though, if you use all the features of the phone, the battery will stay for the whole day long. 15 Watt quick charging enables you to quick charge the phone and use it for the day long.5. Processor, Storage and Ram: I've bought the 6GB 128GB version,  which has sufficient storage memory and RAM to copeup with your rigourous use, let it be games, videos or applications. The monster never slows down. Samsung Exynos 9611 Octacore processor is superb. Mali G72 MP3 GPU lets you play your favourite games with more fun!6. Software: The Android 10 with One UI 2.0 is an excellent combination making the phone literally your virtual assistant. Samsung Galaxy apps are added advantages apart from the hardware quality!7. Phone is light weight and slim, though long due to its screen size, bit its neccessary for a better viewing experience.8. Loud speaker is good. Headphones support Dolby Atmos, and customizable sound profile to give you an amazing sound effect using headphones.9. Other features include USB Type C, A-GPS with Glonass and BDS, Fingerprint sensor, accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, dual 4G LTE standby (Good for Jio users!), Screen cast inbuilt and dual sim support with seperate memory card ecpansion slot with 512 GB card support.10. Most important: Its Made in India! :)Now the Cons:1. Most needed these days is the NFC support for digital payments. Does not have NFC.2. No Earphones in the box (Samsung provides one of the best headphones). Though @Samsung says that headphones are user specific, but still I would say headphones must be included, as they are one of the best.In all, to summarize I would say that it is definitely a go for a great price of 15k for 6GB 128GB model. Great purchase with excellent features. I love my this monster.. 9.8/10.. Definitely go for it..

  My S10 screen went faulty after 9 months of purchase and it being the lockdown period all service centers were closed. I needed a good phone as I'm a trainer and my work depends on it. I've been a Samsung buyer for years now and so I chose the higher version M21 as a compromise. However to my surprise it did everything that my S10 could and had a better battery backup as compared to the S10. The only things it didn't have were fancy features like DEX and wireless charging. Functionally a better phone and much more useful than an S10. So I bought another lower end one for my elderly mother so that she could watch programs on OTT platforms and use WhatsApp without worrying about the battery draining out and also enjoy the decently big screen size which is enough to watch movies and play games. It's a good phone in the price range and everytime I feel like fixing my S10 screen I push off the thought 'cos I could get another M21 at the repair cost. It's a good purchase add against considering a Chinese phone at around the same price. Close your eyes and buy an M21 whether you're looking for a first or second or third phone.

  10-09-2020I am one of the loyal customers of Amazon from last 6-7 years. Right from daily needs to washing machine I have purchased from Amazon. I am shocked this time to experience the fraud amazon have done. As mentioned in my review dated 03-09-2020, the samsung-21 phone I bought was having major issue of volume. Hence, I opted for replacement. To which I got notification that, replacement is possible only after 9-9-2020. As per the instructions today when I again wanted to opt for replacement the window says, ‚ÄúRETURN WINDOW CLOSED ON 9TH‚Äù. This is complete intentional fraud with customer.03-09-2020So I purchased Samsung because I wanted to buy Indian product. But very disheartening to inform that I have received faulty product. At full volume, I am unable to hear anything. I am trying to listen WhatsApp messages with headphones on which is hardly audible & also continuously getting notification sound from background which is not of my phone.I am at loss to understand how such major fault have been ignored by Quality Assurance Team. Please do not buy this product at all.

  I purchased this phone as i had used galaxy M30 with great satisfaction and i started liking new features of samsung.The Galaxy M21 is a mid-range smartphone from Samsung with powerpunch features. I have purchased this  phone at 50 percent cost of Samsung M30 but had more features than the older phone at much lesser price.Samsung Galaxy M21 specificationsBody: Glass front, polycarbonate back and side frame, a little heavy though manageableScreen: 6.4-inch FHD+ (1080 x 2340px) attractive display with adjustable display.Rear camera: Primary 48MP, f/2.0 aperture; Ultra wide-angle: 8MP, f/2.2 aperture; 5MP depth sensor; LED flash; 2160p@30fps video recordingFront camera: 20MP, f/2.2 aperture overall an awesome featured cameras in a budget phone.Chipset: Exynos 9611: octa-core CPU (4x2.3 GHz Cortex-A73 & 4x1.7 GHz Cortex-A53), Mali-G72 MP3 GPU, it works fine in various games.Memory: 4/64GB or 6/128GB UFS 2.1; dedicated microSD slot for up to 1TB expansionOS: Android 10; Samsung One UI 2Battery: 6,000mAh, 15W chargingConnectivity: Dual SIM (4G), Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac, USB-C; 3.5mm audio jackMisc: Rear-mounted fingerprint reader, FM radio is available.

  If you are planning to buy midrange phone with 13k to 14k then go for this, Camera quality awesome 4 ratings out of 5. 5 out 5 for battery life. Everything is goof in this phone except taking long time to charged phone(2.5 hr for 0 to 100% charging). If you are soft use then mobile battery will discharge in 2 days. which is almost better quality than other mid-range phone. Processor also fine with respect to RAM and Internal memory so no lag while playing Heavy games or application. If you are planning to buy Mid-range phone the prefer this with S-Amoled Disply.

  First I want to say about the processor which is I think AI based giving sufficient performance to do your daily job but you're a gamer who's playing non stop gaming without giving rest the device not this is not for you sorry. The UI given here gives lot of freedom to edit yourself like a superuser. The hardware and the software perfectly optimise as every things hands on samsung. Battery life as it mentioned Monster. I here about network issue which I faced also in my jio sim but if you perfectly in network setting then you can see the network mode is by default set in LTE/3G/2G (auto connected) which is the problem if you don't change to LTE only, because jio has only 4G network support and it doesn't have any 3G and 2G network, when the device fell that the LTE signal is become weaker then it automatically changes the network to lower suitable one, so I suggest the user who have this type of issue and using 4G sim then change the setting to LTE only. You'll get a great superb camera.I did't like the built quality where the company did price cutting for giving a AMOLED display which gets easily scratch by your surrounding recommendation to use case and temper glass as immediately you buy the product. Charging speed is too slower as compare to huge battery which is ok. Only i missing here is network speed indicator which can be resolve by a third party app but every company giving this one but samsung..?? hope they will update that one in next update .Finally best in this budget but company should provide case with the mobile.

  I had been using this for last one week and here are my feedback:PROS:1. Best thing is the UI. Almost like the standard Android UI2. No unnecessary apps. Even if there few pre-installed apps but it allows to uninstall them3. Battery life is good. With normal usage it is giving me backup of around 2 days(100% to 9%)4. Charging time: It takes around 2hours for 10% to 100%5. Camera: It is ok, but not something like 48mp6. No Heating problems7. Face recognitionis fine. It even recognizes in complete darkness8. Both the SIM slots are Volte enabledCONS:1. Headphone socket is at the bottom of the phone. This matters when you are using headphone but cannot place it anywhere as the headphone is connected from the bottom of the handset2. Charger Cable length is short as compared to other brands3. Settings: I struggled a lot to turn-off the vibration for notifications (final solution- we have to turn it off for each of the apps one by one)Based on these, the weightage of Pros is more than Cons. So, we can go for this product :)

  My name is Tarachand Sharma, who is in the Pali district of Rajasthan, I am buying a Samsung phone 21, but its battery is not running, I have been trying to return it for 3 days but so far I am not getting any answer and Nor is any policy in the show going on in this product, I am very nervous,Rubbish phone is a total loss deal, my advice is to people who buy this phone and whatever product they are buying from Amazon site, I do not buy a lot of items, there is some defect in everything and they do not even return.

  hello , this was my first smartphone from amazon.. i have never used an android phone before, i ordered this  phone, samsung galaxy M21 on sale last month in august only, initially i clicked pics with the phone and the picture quality was pretty good but when i clicked the same pics with flash on, there was a blue tiny in the pics.. i thought may be its because of some lighting effect  but later i tried clicking pics in day light, at night.. indoor, outdoor. but still i faced the same issue, i had been to the service center they said camera is faulty. but they cannot exchange the phone. though they can repair it.. i'm skeptical will the camera work properly after repair or may for sometime it will work and who knows later the issue will be there again? also there is problem in speaker and microphone! voice is not clear while talking.Now who will take the responsibility, they must check the product before selling..overall this purchase was a waste of moneysamsung is a good brand but they should take the responsibility if customer is facing issue, the customer service at the service center is worst! i didnt see a single happy customer over there who have got a good resolution!

  Had read here in most of the other reviews that the phone has severe heating issues and sincerely hoped that this wouldn't be the case with my device. Here's my review:1. Looks and feels like a mid- to high-end device. A bit slippery, so you might have to get a back/flip cover2. Chose this for my mom due to its low SAR rating, a few people had pointed out that this resulted in low network strength. This has not been the case for my device. Network strength remains unchanged from the previous handset3. Battery life remains its biggest plus point. Lasts more than a day easily with moderate to heavy usage. For a day or two, the battery doesn't seem like it is 6000 mAH. However in about 4-5 days, it adapts itself and there is a considerable difference and one can see that it lasts longer.4. Low to Moderate heating issues. My mother prefers a flip cover anyways, so that is easily masked in this case.5. Camera quality is above average. Make sure to change the settings to highest quality images. The default setting is for low quality. This has caused a lot of people to comment that the image quality is poor.6. The resolution is perfect and bezels remain as low as possible. Its the closest you can get to highest resolution in this phone range.7. Chose the 4gb/64 gb variant due to negligible gaming needs. For now, that serves the purpose perfectly. There's no lag during browsing or app change as such.8. Samsung device, so no hassles with bloatware that comes pre added with the like sof Xiaomi or Oppo or Vivo.All in all, a very decent mid-range device that should last for 2-3 years, which is the normal life of a cell-phone these days.

  Phone is good!There is an issue when merging conference call. It will hang the calls on hold and you have to disconnect all the calls. Camera nothing great. Battery is very good. Fast charging and normal charging time almost the same. Finger print reader does not work if your finger is sweat. Lot of blotwares on software update. Latest software update was 1 GB and it consists of Payu money app and other blotware apps. Recomending to factory reset and uninstall all those blotwares. Some blotware apps are not allowed to uninstall so just have to disable it manually. Samsung keyboard simply refuses to show sometimes even if I am in typing mode, microphone gives echo effect to the receivers when I make calls, chrome app hangs, wifi both 2.4 ghz and 5ghz tends to disconnect internet automatically if your signal strength is low. Even if we have dual sim capability on this phone, recommended to use one sim because the performace of your phone in terms of network and hardware features will be very limited when you are using duel sim

  I liked this phone.. battery back up is awesome .. but yes. It takes approx 2 Houston's full charge..camea is also goodThis is the best phone in this range in the entire market..I was scared while buying it as I was not a fan of samsung Mobiles, but thank god, this phone met n exceeded my expectations

"

  I purchased Samsung M21 a month ago and I'm simply impressed with its performance.Battery:The battery capacity of 6000 mah is highly reliable and last for 1.5 days with a full charge and 100% data on. The phone reaches 100% charge from 1% in about 90 minutes and once fully charged, you are on for a marathon.Camera:I was personally impressed with the camera performance. In the budget of Rs. 14,000, I by far would rate Samsung M21 as one of the best phones available in the market. Apart from Triple camera, the phone comes up with multiple camera features that would certainly engage the user.Speed and Performance:The speed of the phone is really good and does not slow down even if you open 10 applications at the same time. With 64 GB inbuilt memory expandable upto 512 GB ensures your phone is always available to load more. The seamless experience with video calls, messages and Business applications like MS teams, Outlook, Office, etc make the phone fit the Business segment.Overall, just go for Samsung M21 if you are looking for performance, features and price worthy.

  You must think twice before buying of Samsung.1.Let's take the example of Samsung M21 mobile. Speaker sound quality is very bad, no bass response.2.Call quality is very bad3.After some time you can't able to download app- will show searching for Wi-Fi even with mobile data ON. You have to clear cache files in Google Play Store and Play Services App to get rid of this problem time to time. You will never face this problem in MI or Vivo mobiles as these cache got automatically deleted after download.4.Build quality is very bad(plastic).5.Samsung unnecessarily hiked the price of all mobiles.6.UI of Samsung mobile is not all user friendly like MI.7.It is true that only display, battery and camera are good and rest is faltu.

"

  Its a Samsung phone, so overall quality and durability is guaranteed! Performance is good, phone does not hang, battery capacity is big at 6000 mAh, and charging is fast. The screen is an absolute beauty I must say - amazing colours and contrast, the only low point of this phone is the camera performance in dark conditions which is not bad but not good either, average performance .... also the wide-angle camera distorts the image - I hope software updates can fix the issue.

  Dear Sir/ Madam,I have purchased Samsung M21 on dated 25/07/2020 via Amazon India Online Purchase, which was delivered on 28/07/2020. But on dated 12Aug 2020, phone was not working properly as I was unable to open the pattern lock. The next day there was a small blue and pink color dot on the left side of the screen. I have contacted the Samsung  Service Centre in Mathura. They have provided a service order number 4307833776. The phone is neither damaged nor pressed with weight. They are charging money to resolve the issue, but as a rational customer I have neither damaged the phone nor put any heavy weight on it. I have purchased the phone for 17000 Rs. but within 17 days the problem has raised, the device hasn't damaged from any side/part of it.You are requested to please look into the matter and resolve it as soon  as possible so that the faith of customer remains in your esteemed organization. I have first time purchased a samsung phone but the problem raised.

  Since I lost first 3-4 days of using due to internet connection issue started using it from 4th day only.Battery life was best on day 5 - battery % was above 40 % on the second day usage with intermittent use of internet. Then it was good on the 6th day around 25 % battery was available at end of day. Had to charge before sleeping.  7th day battery is remaining 30% on the next day morning.Now the return window is closed.Repenting on buying this phone.

"
"

  Worst phone i have ever bought. I bought it on 4 July. On 26 july it has a tumb mark on screen. I went to service center but they denied to change the screen and said you have mistakenly press it and it is not our warranty. Is it possible? Because i don't press it. They want screen repair charge  5 thousands something. Its very irritating. First time i bought samsung mobile and the mobile and the services is worst. I recommend all of my colleagues and friends not to buy any samsung product. Please don't buy it.

  I bought this phone at  14k and bought a hard case and screen guard at 1k, overall at 15k got a very good phone.The only lesser feature i got from this is the camera rest is all good for the price. Its important to know that we wont get a back cover for this price and since its a plastic back its better to buy a back cover preferably a hard case for protection

"
"

  Best display, Best Camera, Best Battery under 14000 price range.From back It looks cheap because of the polycarbonate material, but if you apply a cover, you can easily  hide this disadvantage.The Super Amoled display is amazing you will love that.Pros : Amazing Camera picture quality, Big 6000 MAH battery, Super Amoled  display, clean User Interface.Cons : Cheap Polycarbonate body, Gorilla  Glass 5 protection missing as GG 3 protection  given, Processor could be better.

  Best budget phone in recent times. SAMSUNG proved that brand is a brand always.6000 mah batteryExcellent camera(48mp and 20mp)Dolby atmos feature (on headset)Full HD screenAmoled screenAll these for 12699/-Undoubtedly the beast in battery backup.For pubg gamersIt runs smoothly on Smooth and extreme option. FYI I am not a big gamer to review on this.

  It is a good phone for day to day use with superb camera quality and very good battery life .with awesome screen display quality but sometimes there is a little frame drops notice able good for gaming like pubg and all . No lags noticable or frame drops during game play no heating issue but the problem is that it stratus between using apps sometimes which is not at all a big issueThe best phone under 14000 a person could getI myself highly recommend this phone üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ

  Well I feel bad while writing this review but the phone is not up to the expectation. Battery drains out relatively quickly and takes a bit of time to get fully charged. The fingerprint reader is good and sensitive. The camera is of decent quality and you can click clear images with it. Samsung can seriously work on UI improvements. It feels that I am using outdated UI. To be honest I ordered it only because I did not want to order Chinese phone. Overall 3 star rating from my end.

"
"

  It is a good option for normal users. But don't buy these mobile for gaming. Gaming is not bad But we are playing high graphical games like pubg, call of duty, it may be lags. Camera is awesome in day light. But low light visibility is not good.Display there was no smartphone under 15000 to beat samsung galaxy m21. Battery is good but dont seems to be a 6000mah it drains like 5000 mah. Fast charging is not good it would take 2.45 hrs to charge 0% to100%. Design is not good it is plastic design which was dont look like premium.When you are a heavy gamer than you go for realme 6.when your preference is camera and design go for redmi note 9 pro. Comparing to realme 6 and redmi note 9 pro i choose m21 because of super amoled screen and a huge battery life and m21 is cheaper than these 2 smartphones

  Well this phone, the screen, the battery, the camera and every hardware aspect is way good at this price. I just love watching videos on this screen; on a single day use, I don't need to charge it, even for once and the camera is good. I'm using this for two months and there is this issue about VoLTE. The VoLTE sign often stops showing, sometimes the connection jumps from LTE to 2G and wouldn't show 4G, unless restarted or the flight mode is switched on and off. At first I thought it was my SIM operator's problem. I called them and they informed it was device's problem. So, I googled it and turns out, a lot many people using various SIM operators are facing the same issue. Although it seems to be software bug and I hope they rectify it with future updates. Also the fingerprint scanner gets smudgy and wouldn't work, often. I don't play games on phones, so I don't how the processor holds on gaming; the user interface is smooth though.

  Review after using 15 days.This phone feels good in hand. Priced at reasonable rate. Screen is good, sound is clear. There are few cons.1) Camera quality is very bad. Back camera is claimed 48 MP but photos in low light are of very poor quality. Selfie camera quality is also very bad. I give only 2 stars for camera because of OS of camera. Better samsung should give less MP with good quality images.2) Video playback is not good. Videos shot on other mobile hangs a lot.Initially I got a problem of very slow charging speed during even fast charge mode. Then Amazon care guided me some trouble shoot and ask to drain full battery and then charging the mobile. This helped and speed of charging improved. But mobile tower signal is low compared to other brand with same network and same place. Also video Play back of stored video is poor.Overall good mobile compared to samsung M30s but not with competitor brands. Only samsung lovers can like this phone.I recommend to go with MI note 8 pro or note 9 pro at this budget.

  First of all hats off to Amazon's delivery even in stormy weather they delivered it next day of order.Packaging could have been better though.I believe the phone box should have been placed in a cardboard box and then should have been wrapped in bubble wrap and plastic.About phone now.It is an absolute delight to look at and use super AMOLED display. The phone comes with a ton of preloaded apps many of which can be removed though. Both camera set ups, rear and front are nice though. Image comes a little bit warmer in tone. Speaker sound quality is loud and clear. Battery back up is marvelous. Media streaming experience is great. You get Dolby Atmos sound with headphones on. Network reception is great and emhced with WiFi calling.All in all phone is a little bit overpriced, but may be justified by sAMOLED display.

"
"

  After one month of usage I have posted this review.1) Camera: Above average2) Battery: Excellent (for normal usage upto 2 days)3) Display: Amazing as expected4) Performance: For normal daily usage no any lag noticed.5) Built quality: As it is Samsung device so built quality is solid.6) In device ads: No any ads or recommendations noticed you just need to disable discover option in the settings.7) Bloatware: Some preinstalled apps were present but you can uninstalled it.So overall experience is excellent. If you are looking for perfect device for normal usage then you can definitely go for it.

  I bought this phone for my mother. So the phone is not being used for gaming. The load on RAM and processor is quite high since a lot of apps run in background as my mother doesn't close them when not in use. The phone has been working fine and there are no complaints till date.M21 is a very good phone by Samsung in its segment.Processing and RAM usage : The phone's processing is good and also the amount of memory used by the apps and OS is decent. At any point of time you would have 1.2/4 GB available with basic apps installed. The response from the phone on app launch/navigation is pretty decent, neither it's very fast nor is it very slow.Camera: The camera quality is very competitive in this segment. No complaints here.Sensors : Face Recognition is a bit slow but fingerprint recognition is fast.Screen: The screen is awesome. The colour and depth are in detail.Battery Life: Battery life is amazing since it has 6000 mAh battery. Charging time is also quite efficient.Build Quality: The phone's build quality and finish is very good.Overall Rating : 4.2 /5

  Samsung M21 is a awesome phone.Battery life is very good after one charge it is run one and half day if normal useage.Fingerprint sensor is very fast.Super amoled screen is really very nice.Rear Camera shot nice pictures and also front camera is very good.Processor is good and phone run very smooth but yes I'm not a game lover.I just found one con after one week useage battery take 3 hour to charge from zero to 100%. 15watt charger is not enoughOVERALL Phone is a real monster.

  Writing this review after using the phone for 45 days.This is my first samsung phone.Utterly disappointed by the performance. Did go through the reviews before buying the phone where I found some mixed answers.i guess I should not have overlooked people's concerns which they posted here.so here I go with what I have been facing ever since I bought it.1) battery takes 2.5 hours to completely charge.so don't go by the mentioned spec fast charging ..phones back in 2010 also did not take 2.5 hours to completely charge.2)phone's width makes it look ugly..after putting tampered glass and back cover,it will look extra thick.3)frequent lagging.4)by any chance if you are a pubg gamer ,this phone is definitely not for u.heats up in one match and lags like hell.pubg runs 10 times better in my old moto g5,Nokia 6.1 and realme c2.5)camera quality is average.you won't get 48 mp feeling for sure..6)the only good thing about the phone is it's finger print senser.Kindly consider these points before u think of buying this phone..

  It's almost 3 months since I got this monster at 12.5k. I'll mention the Pros. & Cons.:-PROS1. A good brand at a reasonable price.2. Amazing camera for daily users.3. Battery backup is more than good.4. Ergonomically designed, so easy to hold in  hands.5. Dolby Atmos Integrated.CONS.1. Battery backup not as expected from a  6000mAh battery.2. Phone speed drastically decreased by 20-  25% after 10-12 days of usage.3. A 14watt fast charger is provided which  takes around 3 hours to juice up from 0-  100% & it's too much. (I would rather prefer  a fast charging phone over big battery size)4. A poly carb. back cover looks cheap.Conclusion-- The only thing that makes me happy after buying this device is, this is not a chinese brand. The performance is average. If you are looking for a better performance, please go for Redmi.

  I am using this phone from last one week. This  is the best budget phone under 15k.It has huge battery. It last for one and half day with moderate usage. three times my old phoneI am normal user. Camera is good as well.  Only one problem is it takes time to full recharge 3 hours from 0 - 100% but that is something we can adjust atleast I am not going for chinese phone.

"
"

  Processor  is not a good one. Hangs a lot. While shooting  video screen gets extremely  hot... camera  could be more better.In this phone only screen quality  and battery  life is good rest is not justifying  its price. I WOULD SAY THATIt could be priced10000 rupees.Don't  buy if you have a heavy  usage, even if you don't  play  game. I won't  work for a quality  game  play. It gets hanged and hot. Not able to play videos properly  after shoot....It's good for normal average  usage not good for the technical  people.

  Hi I am now using this phone for last one month. So I feel like reviewing it.1st fingerprint scanner= it's good but I truly don't feel that wow feeling while using it even sometimes don't respond on 1st attempts but it also may be for dust sometimes so 4 star.2nd battery life= it easily give u 24 hours battery life from 95%-20% but it doesn't give u feel like 6000 mah battery feeling feel like around 4000 mah. That's why I'll give 3.53rd camera quality = don't going to pixel ppi factors in detail but simply when i click a photo in  bright condition it gives a rich photo looks good detailing also not bad but yes nothing extraordinary but and video is also decent yeah slightly lacks stability. So I'll give 44th heating issue= yes it has if u use it for streaming around  2 hrs constantly it heats up but frankly most of mid range smartphones heats up at least from my last 6 yrs experience I can say that but yes snapdragon would have performed little better in this case.I'm not a gamer so I cant share that experience.In short, I must say I'm quite a happy buyer because overall performance according to my necessity it performs well. above mentioned points are just device's pros and cons.

  Awesome budget friendly smartphone from Samsung.1.Best display in this range AMOLED is far better than LCDs. A ""U"" cutout AMOLED is better than a punch hole LCD. The software takes full advantage of AMOLED in dark mode. Perfect display for binge watchers.2.Performance is good enough for a normal user (not a Gamer). The phone heats up on gaming far easier than its counterparts. So not a performance issue for most of the users.3.Coming to battery life this beast can last up to 2 days for a casual user. Giving upto 11hours of on screen time. Even with over 5 hours of zoom calls daily zoom calls plus the causal usage one cannot kill this phone in a day. So nice for students looking for a battery beast to last full day of online classes.4. This phone does not live upto to its competitors in the camera department. Sure it has a 48MP primary lens, but the photos come out over saturated and struggle in low light conditions. But give it enough natural light and it pics come out pretty good.5. Software: this field is unbeatable in case of Samsung's ONE UI 2.0 one of the best custom skins over the already good enough Android 10. Not a fan of Samsung's apps but sometimes of them like Samsung calender, clock , calculator are better than the Google alternatives. Also as the phone will get 2 major software updates till android 12 it is a future proof beast.That's all so overall I will give this smartphone a 9.8/10 for checking all the necessary boxes for a good smartphone at this price range.‚úåÔ∏è

  I was using Redmi note 6 PRO for almost 1 year, and I Bought M21 in Exchange offer in Amazon,  The exchange Offer is Awesome, I dont think any Local Retailer would be able to give the Same Exchange amount as Amazon.After 1 week of Usage, I feel the Phone is Pretty good for the Day to day Basic functions.  I would like to compare it with my Redmi note 6 PRO.Performance Wise, I thought the Redmi note 6 was Slightly Better, but I dont see Significant difference between Redmi and M21.  Overall the performance of the Phone is decent for the price you pay.I am not Fan of Games, and I cant comment on Performance of the phone while you Play Games, But I think it cannot be used for Playing Games such as PUBG.The Redmi note 6 PRO has 4000maH battery,whilst M21 has 6000maH,  However I see that the battery life Both Phones were almost the same with Moderage Usage.  This was very Disappointing on M21 as 6000maH Battery was the highlight of the Phone, and One would expect more Battery life on M21. Sadly thats the not the case.I am not saying battery Life is bad, You would get the same life which you get on any Phone that has 4000MaH, However thats not what you expect from 6000maH Battery.One Important thing I would like to mention about M21 is that, all notitifications works pretty Weel on M21.  Its not only with M21, but with all Samsung Phones for that matter. I am talking about the Apps such Outlook, Skype for Business etc.  The Notifications for skype Never works on Redmi, for Outlook it works someties, and sometimes it doesnt.  But It has been working fine with all my official apps on M21.  It may not be relevant to everyone, but for a person who keeps checking their phone for their Outlook and skype messages, it matters a Lot.  I have also noted the same Issue with Other Apps on Redmi Phone. If you guys are familiar with Mygate, I never used to get E-intercomm Call on MyGate ( This was the same on Redmi and also my RealME ( MyWife's Phone).  I would say, when it comes to User interface and User experience Samsung defeats all other Chines Made Phones which are available in the market.Another Point I want to add is that, I have Samsung Galaxy Ear Buds which I was using it with Redmi Phone, and it never used to work. I used to face frequent voice cut with the earphone, but now with Galaxy it works like a Charm.  The Galaxy Ear Buds is designed for only Galaxy Phones.  In case anyone is planning to buy it, get it only if you have a Samsung, else it will be a waste of Money.

  I got my M21 on 21M (21st May). Been using it since and it's been brilliant.Pros:Amazing displayGreat cameras for day light and ample artificial light photosGreat battery (even though it isn't optimized yet, it's giving great backup)Good RAM managementFeature packedCons:Bad low light photosAll in all, a great phone at the price. Couldn't have asked for more.Edit- after more than a month of using:The battery life is amazing - its providing me 12-13 hours of screen on time with more than 2 days of moderate use.Camera is amazing: Bokeh effect, ultra wide photography, pro modes etc are working perfectly fine - can even compare them to my old oneplus phone. The only problem is low light photos - they are bad.Display and screen quality is top notch.

  What I didn't like is-1) when I received the package, the box inside outer plastic package and bubble wrap was torn, its sticker which prevents the box from opening was also torn.I thought I would have to return the product (I have also took video of opening), but then thought about giving a benifit of doubt and switched on the phone, to my surprise the Android was starting up for the first time. So I kept the phone.If I keep this incidence aside, I would have given a five star rating.2) because of the big screen to body ratio, it is hard to hold the phone without activating any functions near the screen edges.Pros-1) first time after old Nokia feature phone days I am charging the phone only twice a week.2) Super AMOLED display is really crisp and efficient3) smooth running, smooth charging4) no heating up.5) good camera features.

  This device is great for handling daily tasks smoothly and you can do gaming also. But you can't play high end games like pubg for long time. I mean, you can play pubg in this smartphone but only for shorter time like 30 minutes at full battery then it will start lagging very much. You can't  play competitively. At the end, if you want a gaming smartphone don't  buy it but if you want a good smartphone as a daily driver you can go for it without a second thought. It's battery, screen quality and software optimisation makes it a very good smartphone in this price range.

  I wanted to try samsung make the very first time and bought this mobile phone, overall found the battery backup and display quality good. did not face any call related issues either voice or data. But speaker phone seems to be off a bit, faced issues conversing when on speaker. I can see clear panel gaps with screen not properly sticked to the below panel which I never faced in this price range of 13k when compared with Mi or Xiaomi. Did not want to replace it due to hassle process of replacement and all. overall an ok-ok phone.

  Everybody would have provided review.Phone is great. I have received it today so will update more after use.The most important thing to note is - Preloaded apps which couldn't be uninstalled or deleted.  Unfortunately this is problem in lots of custom ui phones.I hope Samsung listen to buyers and atleast give features to uninstall these app.For instance I don't want Facebook app on my phone, I don't want so many irritating app from Samsung but I have to keep it in my phone.@Samsung please take this feedback. Otherwise you are great. That one star less on rating is because of preloaded apps.

  I am writing this product review after using it for almost 12 days. First thing you will like about this device is its super AMOLED display, its the best quality display out there. The build quality is just fine it comes with gorilla glass 3 protection but its better to put on a case and a glass screen protector to avoid any scratches,  believe me you don't want to scratch that beautiful super amoled display. Samsung UI is better with no ads. The phone is very well optimized. It cleans the junk files and frees up  ram and storage by itself every day at midnight. The processor handles every day task quite easily, doesn't have any heating issues. It has a massive 6000mah battery which generally takes 2 to 2&half hrs for charging with the 15Watt fast charger bundled inside the box. The battery can easily give you 1& half day of usage (ie 9-10hrs of screen on time). Initially it calliberates the battery usage and charging speed so don't get worried. Ram management is done nicely, i was surprised to see a YouTube video start from where I left the night before. Little things to like about this device are Samsung keyboard,  Samsung switch, cleaner UI etc. Audio from the headphone is quite impressive, it has the Dolby Atmos Audio effects. Haven't spent much time on camera yet but during my brief exposure i find it working fine, shutter speed is fast, quickly saves the images and has different shooting modes (night, pro, food, super slo mo, hyperlapse AR emoji etc). Image quality is fine and well detailed. A lot of people have complained about its network reception  issues but I  can assure you the network reception is just fine. Actually if you switch from certain chinese phones you will notice a slight network drop but Samsung has optimized the phone to emit less radiation (have low SAR value) which are against the ethics of chinese manufacturers.  If you notice any network issues then contact your network operator to solve the issue, i was Initially facing some troubles in internet connectivity on my BSNL 3g network which was finally solved by the network operator. There is no issues with the phone. Final verdict- You cannot find any other made in India phone with such features in this price range There is either Samsung Galaxy M21/ M31. So just go for it. I am glad that I again switched to Samsung after a brief experience with my Realme device.

  I bought this product in INR 13999 and I am writing this review after use of 1 month.Following are the best features of this phone I liked:-1. 6000mAh battery:I keep wifi turned ON whole day & watch videos on mobile. Still my phone battery never drained to 50% mark in 24hrs.On normal day, it drains to 70% mark in 24hrs. When I used it heavily, it drained max upto 56% mark in 24hrs.2. 15W type C chargingCharging is quite quick compared to older phone chargers.3. DisplaysAMOLED is quite cool. If you watch video at night in quite dark, you will feel like your watch in Cinema Hall.Experience is quite well compared to older IPS screens. It does not hurt your eyes in dark.4. SoundSound is rich. Call/Music sound quality is very good. Plus ""Dolby Atmos"" sound system is there for more effects.5. Camera QualityQuality is good and includes all the latest features like wide angle, super depth, night vision etc. Selfi quality is quite good.6. In-built Caller IDI detects spam calls quite accurately. You will not need to depend on TrueCaller kind of apps if you use them only to detect if incoming unknown number is Spam or not.7. AI used in One UI 2.0Time to time, you will experience that they have used AI to help you use some settings effectively.It has many other good features but I enlisted those which really make it Stand Out in a crowd of smartphones for me.I ensure you will not regret buying this one.

  I'm in love with this phone. I think its the best in its segment i.e. the below 15k mark. The sAmoled display is just superb and is worth the money. The super large battery is good but the charger is slow (a little). Tge camera quality is mind-blowing and captures crisp and clear photos. The front camera is super good too. The processor is just a little less powerful than of its competitors, good for low to moderate gaming. It does a fabulous job in day-to-day tasks and will not lag. Highly recommended. And one more thing you might get confused in between realme 6i and m21. I too got confused but if you are a gamer and don't care for your privacy go for realme 6i. But if you are a normal user who wants to surf net, get crisp quality photos, get a wonderful sAmoled display. Go for M21 without any hesitation. Best in its segment.

  #camera quality is average(3/5)#heating issue more(some times feel like it going for burn)# display is good#battery life- display consuming too much of power for working.. So we will get maximum1.5 days life.Actually I facing heating issues with this phone.. I had called 4,5times for replacement. But Amazon people telling that heating level is normal as per their policy. At the end of the long talk they escalated this issue for a agent to visit and conform. That guy called and asked issue and told that he is not able to come for this type of issues in this covid situation.. Finally they closed this issue and still facing heating issue if I use it Condinusly for 1 hr. I really fed up with this phone and replacements policy and I stopped buying costly products from Amazon.. It is like we taking a risk...

  Samsung galaxy M21 is a good phone for an ordinary or average mobile phone user.Fingerprint sensor: GoodCamera quality : Good for this price but in some aspects redmi note 9 pro is better and in some aspects samsung is betterDesign quality: good, but redmi note 9 pro has a better finish and outer bodyRam management: good and better compared to redmi note 9 proDisplay : samsung always the best display sAMOLED compared to IPS display of redmi note 9 proSpeaker: just average redmi has a better speakerBattery: M21 has a very good battery compared to other phones in this range i.e. 6000mAhGaming: Its Ok for normal and smaller games for ample time but in this aspect the redmi note 9 pro is a better gaming phone.Internet streaming: For those who watches movies, streams in web, youtube,instagram,facebook.... etc. M21 is a lot better in this than other phones in this range.Security: M21 is more secure than chinese phonesUpdates: Its got good updates regularly.If you need a better camera go for M31 or higher but for an ordinary user M21 is more than enough.After all choosing this phone depends on your preferences and needs.But you will get the BRAND Samsung at this range as well compared to chinese phones._ For Indian users

  As the title suggests, it is monster in few terms. However many features are not so monstrous!Pros:1) Amazing display and look2) Slow and hyper motion feature is impressive.3) Super fast finger scanner.4) Doesnt hangs or heat quickely.Cons:1) Average camera, only few features such as close up bokeh effect click good pictures.2) Back camera is okay in sunlight but worst in room light. It looks like 5 mega pixel not 48!3) Battery drains fast!!! Yes you heard right. Few minutes of normal activities such as clicking photos and 7% will be gone.4) High price! Paid extra because it was not made in china.

  Great Camera, excellent screen and superb battery. Dont go for any chinese phone like Redmi note 9 or Realme 6i etc, please compare online this phone has better rating than any Chinese phone and is similarly priced plus Samsung dont do petty tactics of stocking out and flash sale concept to boost sales, a good product doesnt need such gimmicks anyways. Chinese phones show better config on paper but they use such low quality items that they dont last 1 year also. Camera may be 60 80 or may be 108mp but after 6 months they produce such low quality image that phone will become useless. These issues are not there in case of samsung, plus samsung phone hangs a lot is a old theory which chinese company brought to make a hold and are not true. The phone works seamlessly.

  Am very much satisfied with this product of Samsung. Awesome battery , awesome camera , awesome display, performance is good , easy in hand feeling, back panel is somewhat glossy , looks great , face unlock is superb , fingerprint scanner is super fast n the slightest touch unlocks the phone, rise to wake gesture is working so nicely, always on display is good, I play certain games too n it's okay, With playing games n doing ng social media I charge alternate days I bought 4gb 64 gb variant. 6gb variant will give more ease in gaming n multi tasking, so I suggest to go for the higher variant, but who don't want any game , only for social media , this variant is great , go for it.

  Don‚Äôt buy this phone from Amazon this is third graded product waste of money.Such an horrible experience from amazon

"

  If you're from young generation & you want to buy this model for yourself. I suggest you can check other phones within this price range if you're not a heavy user. If it is for your parents or for light work, then you can go for it.Camera quality is good except wide range lens. After captured image with wide angle it can distorted with a little zoom.Battery is more than enough as this phone is suitable for light work.

"
"

  Phone build quality: is good, it catches fingerprints very easily not a good quality material used.Camera: The camera is decent avg i can say on paper its 48mp but when the pic is zoom after clicking it gets blured tough.Screen: i'll give 9/10 for the screen all tough its very good and sharp but still i can see the colour shade appearing are not that bright.Battery: I'll give 4/10 rating because the battery performance which i expected is not upto the mark on paper it really looks attractive 6000mah but when you use it you will know it, only on lite usage without gaming and fully charged it only last 1day max 2hrs to next day and got screen usage only 5-6hrs which is bad for 6000mah it felt like using 4000mah battery.This battery quality could have been better for atleast at this price point of 16kOverall it is a good product its fast no lags or stutter i found

  M21 6gb Ram and 128 GB storage is more powerful in handling multiple task, and I gifted to my wife for her birthday. Since she was a teacher it was more useful in preparing power point presentation, video lessons using KineMaster and other apps like TEAMS, works smoothly. In shorter words it's like a mini computer.Camera quality is awesome, and good to see recording video in Slowmotion and Hyperlapse mode.SAR VALUE is very very low around 0.468, hence radiation is very less.Jio sim is working perfectly, call and signal quality is too good.

  Order on 4th July 2020, and received on 11th July 2020. The product was in good original condition without any transportation issues. Here are some pros and cons I experienced.Pros:1. Good and sturdy feel. Though not required, still got tempered glass and of course a rubberized back case.2. The big RAM (6 GB) is really handy since most of the time the system consumes about 50-60% of the memory i.e. about 3 GB or more. So, the system doesn't show any lag.3. Large storage of 128 GB is also quite useful in the long run. After update from my earlier mobile, i have about 35% storage consumed. Only about 70 GB is remaining out of about 112 GB that is available for use. I have not yet transferred the photos/video from older phone which would be about 25 GB. So, this 128 GB is very useful.4. Camera: I find it to take extremely good pictures. May not be of professional or even semi-professional level. Still good enough to capture moments in life in good quality pictures. The video quality with zoom and google meet for video conferencing, meetings and for giving lectures is much better than all the cameras (mobiles, laptop etc.) that we have. Even in low light, the picture/video quality is very good.Cons:1. The screen sometimes flickers. This problem had been pointed out by earlier buyers also.2. Occasionally, the systems seems to be a bit slow to screen touches. I have not yet fully optimized as per my requirements in the sense that stopping unwanted apps from getting loaded or keep running in the background. Still looking at the specification i.e. processor, memory, graphical processing unit (GPU)  and storage such lags is not expected.3. Ultra slow motion video: This could have been better. I am not able to capture ultra slow motion videos for more than a second or so. Either I couldn't find the proper settings or the mobile doesn't have.4. Battery: I haven't done a thorough testing about the batteries. This are only views based on observations for last 3 weeks. One of the primary reason to buy this product was its battery which is rated at 5800 mAh (and not really 6000 mAh as they advertise). However, the battery backup I didn't find it to be much less may be around 5000 mAh. My Honor 8 (2016 model) with 4000 mAh gives similar backup.Overall, I find this product to be worth buying and has rated 4 out of 5.

  Just go for it if you want Best Battery Backup and Best Display in this price range. Not that good for gamers. UI is clean and smooth. Just Love Samsung.‚ù§Ô∏è

  Samsung makes excellent phones with AMOLED screen that people love to use. The processor and touch response is buttery smooth. Everyday tasks are a breeze. The phone has all the bells and whistles including compass, FM radio, Dolby Atmos, low SAR etc and with the Always On Display (AOD) has superseded the ‚Äúanalogue‚Äù notification light.This phone is a super replacement for non trustworthy Chinese phones. Finally, the fingerprint sensor is lightning fast and its humongous battery is an added advantage. Camera performance and image quality is above par for the phone in this price range.

  If you often use mobile internet on a laptop/desktop via mobile hotspot, do not even think of considering this mobile phone since it doesn't support 5ghz bandwidth, in fact, most of the Samsung phones, even in the higher range such as s9 do not have 5ghz hotspot either. If you're using this phone as a mobile hotspot, I can guarantee that you'll be frustrated in the 1st 10 minutes.  Nothing about this phone is exceptional except for maybe it's battery. The camera & performance are below average, see comparisons on youtube with other phones of the same price range i.e note 9 pro. Now, I'm not advocating for Chinese products, but the NOTE 9 PRO, performs way better than this heavy piece of sheer nonsense. I bought this phone as an act of patriotism since I did not want to buy the Xiomi note 9 pro, as it's chinese product but I am truly disappointed by my decision. P.S Samsung provides the same 5ghz mobile hotspot service in their devices being sold in China & Korea. You can google each and everything that I said in this review to check the authenticity of the information. I highly recommend not buying this phone.

  My opinion on Samsung Galaxy M21 based on my previous 1 month of usage.I‚Äôm going to divide this review between pros and cons.PROS:-1. BATTERY: the battery life is unbelievable! On my usage it even went to day 3 without charging while I had always on display and mobile data turned on every time apart from general usage. I also used the hotspot to connect my mac. Still it went smoothly. Also, despite it‚Äôs huge 6000mAh battery phone doesn‚Äôt seem bulky.2. DISPLAY: the AMOLED panel is very bright, crisp and vibrant. The colour accuracy is also good. Samsung excels when it comes to display anyways.3. CAMERA: considering the price, the camera performance is above average. It takes some decent shots with good background blurring and colour accuracy. The selfie camera is also very good. It takes nice portraits.4. AUDIO: the output through audio jack is good. It has geed clarity and bass is balanced. Neither more nor less.5. HARDWARE: the Exynos 9611 processor handles day-to-day tasks smoothly without being heated up. Thanks to its 10nm processing. I‚Äôm not a gamer but I‚Äôve see seen reviews where it handles games smoothly too. It is accompanied by 4gb DDR4 ram which is good and also UFS2.1 storage which makes the experience even smoother even though the price is so low.6. ONE-UI2.0: the experience is enhanced even more because of the UI. It is smooth, light weight, good looking yet simple and user friendly. Also there are tons of customizable options that helps every phone looks unique.7. NETWORK: there is good cellular reception and I never experienced any network issue whatsoever.CONS:-1. BUILT: thought it has low price but still built quality is not satisfactory. The plastic body in the back panel gets scratched easily. Also, it still has Gorilla glass 3 which seems to be out-dated now.2. SENSORS: the phone lacks compass and ambient light sensors. Though it manages to adjust brightness via front camera which it calls ‚Äòadaptive brightness‚Äô but a dedicated hardware is always a welcome feature.3. SPEAKERS: they are good. But can be better.At a price of 13999/- this phone is sure the best buy. It has AMOLED display which also comes with always on display which make it look pricier than it actually is. Also, this phone is not for hardcore gaming but then, none other phone in this segment can outperform it day-to-day usage. In the end I can say is it has a balanced specs where performance is concerned and adding the huge battery with a good display and oneUI2.0, it becomes the best buy at this price.

  I Purchased this phone it was replaced within  a week. So When i got the delivery 1st time, there was issue with the sound, There was just no sound in 3rd party apps, to which Amazon's Verification team visited checked and agreed to my point. They suggested me for replacement, to which i agreed. Second piece i received was literally cracked from the bottom. I have already seeked for refund but i am not sure i will get it or not. Camera was good, battery was good but this model has sound issues.

  I am not a heavy  gamer and I am writing this review after a week .....1)Display : Awesome sAmoled  Display.....If you use this display then you will never buy LCD display phone in your whole life....2)Camera : Best camera in this price range...Check my photos...3)Battery : Big battery with outstanding performance....Even after the heavy usage of YouTube battery percentage was 25% at the end of the day(12pm).....Check my battery usage photo...4)Processor: Processor is decent...I have not faced any issue until now....5)Design : It is good and lightweight phone but you will not get glass back like other Chinese phones...Cons :1) Slow charging: 2.5 hrs for full charge2) No glassback3) Processor is not good for heavy games like Pubg..You can get better processor in this price range....I am super happy after buying this phone...Now it's your choice what do you want...I will update my review in future....

  Best mobile phone under this price range and battery life is too good almost 2 days with normal use and 1 day with any kind of rough or heavy use and only problem is it has 6000 mah battery but only supports 15w charging at least 30w would be good because for full charge from 0% to 100% it's taking 2:30hrs to 3:00hrs but it's not bothering me because my old phone was taking around same time with 3000mah so at the same time of charging i am getting double backup. And display is super amoled which is awesome and if you like too much edits in photos so this phone will give you so original and crisp and sharp photos but not as oppo vivo like over edited or cartoon like photos. And processor which is exynos 9611 is performing very good i have played pubg for atleast 2hrs but on HDR mode it was running very smooth and battery backup was awesome means for one game of atleast 30 minutes it was taking 7% of battery and don't play pubg like games for long time like more than 2hrs because it will heat little bit. One thing about battery i want to mention majorly that real power of 6000mah you will be able to see after 7 to 10days of use because new battery like this size requires 7 to 10days of charge discharge cycle to adjust itself. Honestly speaking i am writing this feedback at around 5:30pm and battery is on 72% and my mobile was fully charged at 8am in morning.And one of the best thing is that despite having 6000mah battery it's weight is only 188gm means by handling it you can't believe that 6000mah battery is inside.Please buy back cover and put a screen guard to protect it from scratches.

  The phone hot even in standby. You cannot use it even for nominal use.Amazon is just delaying the return. Yesterday asked for hard reset. Today they set a appointment with a technician which is 2 days away.Decent battery life. Average camera. Very good finger print reader. But unbearably hot while in use.Didn't want to write review for a phone which I have to return. But amazon and samsung making me do it

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung and I must say I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for me were - Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone.-The display of the phone is brilliant and is at par with some of the high end phones.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. - The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.The packaging could have been better, there was no bubble wrapping or air pockets around the box for protection against bumps or drops during transit and the packaging was only the Amazon's plastic cover(with a layer of bubble wrapping) which I believe isn't recommend for transportation a smartphone.

  they should have used another proccessor because even though they give 6000mah battery . it also depends on the processor how efficiently the power utilizes as it is an outdated proccessor it dosen't optimize 6000mah compared to other snapdragon proccessor so, i suggest don't fool out with 6000mah because if you compare poco f1 with snapdragon 845 vs this phone both shows same performace in power wise because in poco f1 it optimizes power well compared to this phone. so, 6000mah is for namsake without a good proccessor. so, if anyone wants to take any phone first see its proccessor and then specifications always proccessor must be the first priority

  1. Battery life meeting expectations,  but heating while charging.2. fingerprint sensors bit slow and autoexide number of attempt without touching finger if I am carrying in pants pocket , in short it tries to detect any skin even in pocket.3. Camera is perfect, exiding expectations,  het don't knw how to utilize them efficiently üòÖ.4. Back of the phone gets scratches immediately, you should buy a back cover to its shiny look away from the world , even you cant see it bcz it will be covered with back cover, I think back shine is only for advertisements,  not remaining for show off.üòÑ5. Front glass is awesome and scratch less, haven't used temperature glass or scratch guard yet.Feels like premium phone.

  This phone is absolutely #monster‚óè it has got a 6000 MAH battery which lasts more than one day even after heavy (I attend more than 4 hours of video conference)‚óè both the selfie and the rear cameras work perfectly fine but there is a big drop in lowlight but I believe that a small software update would fix it‚óè everyone knows about the Exynos 9611 processor so I want talk about it‚óè it has 6.4 inches big super amoled display which is absolutely absolutely perfect in this price range and everyone also knows about how Super AMOLED displays are so I won't talk about it‚óè it has a very clean UI which is one UI and I just love it at the start it has some blot wear but I removed it easily‚ñ° one thing I would like to say that when you are setting up the device please read every details very carefully‚óè I am in love with this monster, I would recommend you if you are a student and searching for a good mobile under 15k‚óè this device will never let you downThanks for reading....... hope this helps you

  Before writing the review I want to tell you that I am not a promoter of samsung phones and to be honest I didn't liked the J series at all. But when it comes to this model, samsung has changed each and every bit of it and made this phone a completely different one. I used to watch the reviews of this model and they told that even though the overall performance is good, it is not up to the mark when it comes to gaming. But believe me this one works really well for pubg and there are no problems yet (4GB 64GB). The user interface is absolutely gorgeous. And the SAMOLED screen gives you a tremendous picture quality. The only thing that I am not satisfied about is the 6000 mah battery. I think it is a made up figure. It actually does the same that a 5000 mah can provide. But in overall after using it for last 3 months I can assure you that it is worth for the money. I got it for 12699 which gives me extra satisfaction.

  This product is defective and display is not working in just 3 days and now I have requested 3 times for return and refund but phone is not picked up. Amazon pick up man is refusing for pick up . The return pickup was scheduled on 24th July but no body came for pick up . When I called pick up agent, he said that your pick was cancelled . When I called up amzon customer service , the customer service person told me that while 1st time return pick on 22nd July , the pick up person mentioned comment ‚Äú IMIE no mismatch‚Äù and he did not pick up . In fact how he can see IMIE no when phone display is not working. This is very bad service and system on Amazon . I am surprised with this kind of pathetic service from Amazon.

  The Camera Quality is excellent . Looks too Cute  especially the curved edges1: With 6000 mAh battery, standby time is supperb,2: Most attractive factor of this phone is display. It is an excellent one3 also the Videos with different resolutions shows the real live look.4;Phone's performance is good for a normal user. For a normal user Samsung Exynos 9611 processor is enough.5:Gorilla Glass protection backside n front side Gorilla Glass 3 Protection for Display. Better Front Camera 20mp N6: Real Thunder in Battery Side . Huge supply of power , No need to carry power bank anymore. built quality is wonderfulI Will recommend the product who are looking for mobiles phones under 15K

  The phone is a complete package in the price range, I bought the 4gb variant for 12699, since I feel it's better to buy31 rather than going for m21 6gb variant. It's just, 4gb one is better budget oriented.Anyway, will talk about some good points and bad points, since I have used this phone for almost 5 days.So let's get started:-one of the best thing about this phone which might attract the regular Chinese phone buyers towards its is the display. And yeah I can say it's worth it.-camera is nice for the price range I would say, i.e under 13000, but I don't feel under 15000 it's that good. Since u can get other phone with better camera quality.-now coming to the processor...it's bad! But not that bad...it will provide good overall experience, but gaming, it's not made for it.So overall it's a nice phone, and plus I haven't seen any charging issue as well..It gets fully charged around 160mins as claimed by the co.So my final verdict would be if u want a Samsung phone under budget and are not inclined towards gaming that much((don't get me wrong, u can play games, but there are better phones out for that, for maybe even cheaper)), go for it..But again I would recommend u to go for the 4gb variant or if u want 6gb then go for m31...m21 6gb one is not just worth IMO

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.

  One of the main reason for buying this phone was the higher capacity battery and fast charging, but it failed to deliver on the expectation. The so called fast charging takes almost  3.5 hrs to charge from 5 to 100 percent and top of that with normal usage battery doesnt last for 2 days. The auto adjustment of screen brightness is poor, and found it too bright often and have to reduce manually. Camera quality is good. Sound quality of speaker is poor for both ringer as well songs etc. As a samsung product expected it to be better then what was delivered. They have put a lot of hardware but should work on building a system software which utilizes the hardware efficiently. The RAM consumption until now was always excess of 4 gb always, going upto 5 gb with almost minimum apps running in the background. Thanks to system upgrade installed in July end it is now below 4gb for the first time, hopefully they work further on it to enhance the obvious issues and tune up the system overall soon.

  I brought this as a gift for my brother. This is a great phone for the price! The exchange service was hassle-free, and gave me a great deal on the old phone. I had brought the M20 last year, and this year's M21 has a lot of upgrades & there is a big difference between the two models. The screen is a crisp sAMOLED, which has a great viewing quality, the battery is bigger & lasts longer, and the camera quality is much, much better than the previous model. The phone works great! Thank you Amazon and the seller!

  128 gigs of storage and 6 GB RAM for 15,999 is a pretty good deal. Camera is amazing. Android 10 UI is nice and clean to use.Battery life is good, but for 6000 mAh one expects longer performance. It's good, but a full charge takes almost 3 hours. That and the preinstalled ad-apps (easily circumventable but annoying) are the only downsides.

  I like this phone very much.It has huge battery that last whole day easily under heavy usage. But note that charging fully takes easily around 3.5 hours which is not problem overnight.Phone is quick in reaction and I'm really sensitive about reaction speeds... So I'm happy. Rarely during browsing it lags but I think it is due to browser error and conectivity. On paper some competitors have faster cpu, but in practice I doubt there is much difference... Unless you do games...Speaker sound is ok, though not great.Microphone sound is ok according to callee.Camera is ok, although I'm not a photographer...Usb port works as otg (I can connect my usb flash drive through cable reduction and it works fine).OLED dispaly is super nice, I much prefer over LCD.What is really plus is this phone has antenna bands suitable for both india and europe. Chinease competitors like redmi does not have both bands in one phone.What is minus is there is no NFC.Also rounded dispaly is terrible for fitting any screen protector. If you are super good you have just small reduction on sides after installing screen protector :( You can used to it, but I'm pissed that samsung does such shitty impractical display design...Also for using there is one potential unpleasant thing - samsung has no protection to activate phone in your pocket. There is proximity sensor but it is ignored. If you have phone in your pocket and by mistake touch fingerprints sensor it can be unlocled and anything could be pressed in your pocket...Anyway over all best value phone. And I'm happy to own this one...

The battery  takes nearly 3 hours to be full. ( 2hr 50 min) approx.I am not an avid gamer,  so no comments about gaming  part. If you are looking for a best phone within budget , then this mobile is the best choice.Please  don't  go for redmi as it has heating  issues.Alternative  to Chinese  redmi could  be Samsung.Hope  this review  helps  someone.Thanks.

  After handling this monster for 15 days I'm writing this review.Build quality: Overall a good build quality except at back.User interface: awsome user friendly interface providing an access to every tool, simplified notification panel, dark mode, always on display and much more.Display: a superb viewing experience on a super amoled no doubts.Battery: it's a monster but drains fast and fast charge works average. Providing an usage of one and half day for semi heavy user.Camera: the back camera setup is good but it could be better if optimization is of that level. Front camera is as good as expected it satisfies your needs.Performance: for an average user there is no complaints at all but for an heavy user it may sometimes lags.As a whole its a monster at affordable price rangeGo for it.

  Writing review after 8 hours of opening phone.Getting unbearably hot when on the call within 3min on call and after 15-20 min usage, making it impossible to be kept near ear. Fingerprint is hit or miss. Charging time from 2-91% is 3hrs, who knows how long more it will take. Heating like furnace while charging, one may burn hand from it.Have logged a complaint for replacement. Executive from Amazon tech support asked me to download Balcanno app for troubleshooting. Strangely while the phone was extremely hot the app showing temp. of battery just 32 degree C. and its acceptable range is 48 degrees. An absolutely incorrect results.Who in this world will accept temp range of 48degrees for something which is to be kept near ear..Technician visit schedule for tomorrow, but I request for urgent replacement of device. This is not a delightful experience. I hope Amazon will help me. Keeping my fingers crossed.

  Battery standby is outstanding. You don't need to charge for next 19-20 hours after 100% charge. But it takes 2.5 -3 hours for fully charge. Obviously it's slow but not that slow. Upto 60-70 % get charge rapidly. This is not for PUBG Lovers but still you can play in HDR settings. Guys who watch movies, netflix & other OTT contents seriously this phone is for you. Watch it for 9-10 hours no problem.

"
"

  Battery backup is not as expected from 6000 Mah. Also charging  is very slow, taking almost 6 hours to full charged ( without  any use ). Also heating problem during  phone call and charging.Indoor network is very poor as compared to my another mobile phone with same service provider.I am very disappointed with this product from Samsung. Not acceptable..Please return your product and refund me. So that I can buy a different mobile.

  Nice mobile at mid range price with lot of new features.Best features -Inbuilt VPNEnhanced securityGreat displayHuge battery with fast charging supportGreat Camara with slow motion and hyperplase .Automatic DNSDolby atmosApp usage time managerFocus modeAnd much more....Loved it.Cons- 1.minor heating issue while long working and during charging2.Charging takes little bit more time( may be due to the watt capacity of charger)3. Less frequently hang or close the app.4. Night mode is not much effective.5. Ad during charging on lock screen.6. Finger scan is little bit slower.New update has brought more new feature in it.

  The phone is just superb. The battery is awesome. It can last upto 1.5 days after full charge. The camera quality is also great. Depth effect is fantastic. The front camera is also very good. The performance of this phone is awesome. But there are two things that are the cons of this phone. First one is that the phone automatically restarts sometimes. And the second thing is that is finger print sensor is not upto the mark. Sometimes it cannot read the fingerprint. Apart from these two the phone is brilliant.

  Camera performance really pathetic. Could have been improved. Divices of this budget giving better camera quality. Especially selfie camera is pathetic. Video also in slo-motion keep flicking in night or in low light. I hv vivo v9 pro which is performing dam good in low light n night also if compare to m21. Super slo-motion records for 4 sec video only which is not understood. Disappointed with the purchase. Sumsung pl understand the market without good camera it is difficult to survive in the market. My personal advice ti samsung. Thanks

  Ordered this on 12th August and got this on 22nd... It's a long time... One of my friend ordered on 16th Midnight and got the phone on 17th...The next thing is there was no invoice in the packet...Then the battery is draining out like hell and because of that I can't touch the mobile...5mintues watching of YouTube video taking away 5% charge... Have to give charge for 3 times in last 24 hours...Next the handset is getting toooooooooooooo warm when charging or doing something with the mobile like data transferring or watching YouTube or scrolling fb....Camera quality doesn't seem good to me...Viideo quality is very very bad....But 2of my friends are using same mobile,,,there everything is very good... No problem in there sets...So the conclusion is I GOT A DAMAGED PRODUCT AFTER WAITING FOR EVERYBODY 10 DAYS...My 3years old mobile works and serves better than the Product,,which is delivered to me....

So I turned off fast charging option..You can do that.. Its will not affect batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers ..

Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer ...

  Writing it after using this phone for a week. Considering the price i did not have much hope, but still it was able to disappoint me. This was my second Samsung phone after 7 years,My experience:-1. 6000 mah battery is for the name sake. With normal internet usage and watching couple of clips it goes to 50%.2. The Camera is an utter disappointment. Its not that i was hoping it to be like a high end phone. But its really bad. They hv put lots of features in it and all are below average. Also, it is slow. It takes a considerable number of clicks to flip from front to back camera and vice versa.3. The RAM is of 4 GB which should be good for a new phone running apps one by one, but it flickers and sometimes crashes.My suggestion?:- Please skip it if you can. If you want to buy it for older family members who are just into calling, go for cheaper one than this. At least you would save some money.

  I use a single phone, with high usage of data transmission and data storage, and I also travel a fair deal. So my review may be more relevant for similar users.1. The phone battery goes on and on. Nearly never empties, except when I did not charge for 2 days. Normally, at night it is around 50% and I charge it back to 100%. This is really useful for travel in future, even if currently travel is restricted due to covid.2.  The camera does very competent job of still and videos. I am not a photo expert, so cannot comment on technical complexities there.3. I chose 128GB storage and 6GB RAM. While 64GB / 4GB would have been enough, regular upgrades of Android over next 2-3 years of this phones expected life may need more memory and having more storage also helps in keeping multiple email accounts and also music, pictures, ebooks etc,, without having to worry about phone slowing down due to lack of free space.4. THe display is very sharp and i have not found any difficulty in using it during day or night.5. Response time: The phone is very responsive, far more than the M30 which I used earlier. It has never kept me waiting.6. Connectivity seems very good - have not faced difficulty in wifi, bluetooth connects and also using as hotspot.7. I have two  - 4G SIM cards from different operators - and both work in 4G mode. Older phones allowed only one of the SIMs to work in 4G mode.Suggestion:1. Would like facility to have two users accounts defined under Android. This facility is available under Android but blocked by Samsung in this model.

"

  Writing after one month of use.1.Display is good2. Battery backup is good for regular use of mobile. Battery lasts for 30-32 hours without playing games.3.Takes too much time to recharge the battery, about two and half hour.4.fingerprit reader works quickly but sometimes doesn't work.5.camera quality is good.6.Sound quality is Ok of mobile speaker..very Poor with headphones even with Sony headphones.7.Hangs sometimes.(samsung'süòÉ speciality)*Overall:-Not for online gamersNot for music loversNot for heavy usersGood for regular usersGood for videos and movie lovers.Good for photography lovers.

  I just bought this phone after comparing it with several other phone within the same price range but the 6000 mAh battery, stock android, screen resolution and camera quality left me with no other choice. It is best phone in 10k-15k range and it is really worth to spend 14000 for this device although it listed on Flipkart for 14500 price. Amazon delivered it on time even in this pandemic. Thank you Samsung & Amazon !!!!

  Thanks for Amazon and STPL exclusive online for delivering the product within 9 hrs from order, it's  flash delivery. Packaging was good.Just open up the box, have few recommendation before getting in phone, where Samsung has to improve.1. Expected a Mobile case inbuilt which was missing.2. Warranty card, sorry paper is available. Hope we can claim using invoice with samsung.3. Charger cable was too short, mere 60 cm - shocker to me with such small cable.4. Big bulky charger with 15w fast charging.5. Too many bloatwares by Samsung, moment connected wifi configured downloading many apps. Need to uninstall one by one.6. Plastic back panel, makes mobile alike cheaper product, ahead of good configuration.7. Display is good and 4k wallpapers are so crystal clear along few videos in youtube.8. Approx 24~ gb occupied by default configuration. 102gb user able to use.9. 4k videos playing from youtube are great and treat to watch.10. Neat and elegant design in width, compact in hand with 7.5cm width, which was alligned like 1+ 7t11. No option to resize icons by default system configuration. Very average icon style, rather poor I can say.12. No earphones with kit. Not even basic.13. Smart switch helped to transfer apps and media/files. Missed to transfer system settings.We have to wait and watch to justify if the mobile meets expectations.

  It is value for money product for me. The best part is it's screen which is too good. The camera and performance is also good. Maybe the Chinese phones have a better processor or ram at this price but I don't mind paying a slight more for a non-chinese phone.Would always prefer to buy Samsung phones for their quality. Hope Samsung bring such budget phones with competitive specifications and pricing.

  Fingerprint is very fast,Camera also good ,i like steady mode... Two days battery backup with daily use....Over all awesome build in quality with advanced features and high performance ...

  Neil Armstrong, ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.""i don't take much time, directly review about my Raven Black M21(6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)...Pros:1) the 6000 mah battery totally scam. At first day of receive,it charge upto 83% only in 6 hours and not exceeding(which gave me hard shock). And now after using a week it charge 100% in 2 hours(yes,please read again).Thanks to C type charge. You have to give time to your phone set with charger at initial stage, after that it will surprise you. Even in night phone consumes only 1% and from 100% to 5% it takes 3.5 days to degrade.2) other reviewers(on this or other site) say that M21 is only for non gamer, but i say use it as I install NFS no limit, WGT golf etc. big game and it work completely fine. All thanks to its upgraded android system, best processor and chipset.3) Best quality triple camera with limited best option like Panorama, pro,food,night,slomo, hyperlapse etc.,which i personally like as it will not lag my system configuration.4) Best in era, in todays corona budgetary world with money saving.5) i surely say samsung strong step towards AI tech in medium range phones will help people to upgrade themselves.Cons:1) i concerned about long last life of plastic back cover given, as ""samsung family"" of my house all members uses samsung phones which lasted at least 6 years and still in working condition.2) cons or not, but this time samsung does not give Earphones. Which i like the most compare to other brands. And also omit sample cover for phone.About first line,in my words,""That's one small step for samsung, one giant leap of mankind to AI.""

  am writing my review after using it for 6 days.I have bought sumsung phone after 7 years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

  Good specs... But... literally below average camera... forget low light capturing of any kind and gcam...no knox, applock, good lock, you can't even turn off torch with power button...!!!! What kind of os tunning is that, that too after I have heard a lot about One OS...!!! Oh SAMSUNG! Furthermore, brightness is an issue in direct sunlight, and also in dark room... speaker sound is also an issue.. AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, Network has a grave issue...!!! This phone is like a room with AC, Fridge, large LED Tv, but has a leakage in the roof...!!! Aghust.... Now on 12.07.2020- Amazon is showing its main 48mp camera as a f1.8 camera. But that is wrong. Its main camera is f2.0 aperture. Anyone can check it on Samsung website or anywhere else wherever they can. I don't know why Amazon are misleading.... The question goes to Amazon too... why???

  This is a ausome phone under 15k but i will not revomend this device for gaming as it heqts in just 5 to 20 min .. and also the battery is not good at all .. rather it is 6000 mah but but exhausts from 100% to 30% in just  5 hours during online class which is not a heavey usage ... so it is ausome but if u are in good battery  i will suggeat to buy redmj note 9 pro and if u are in gaming then i woild suggest to buy realme 6 or Samsung a50s .. also i face some statures and lahs also sometime .. The screen is not so flient but the vamera is very nice ...

  I bought this phone with great expectation and I must say it does stand up to its claim, the display is good, speakers are fine, camera is cool and the phone isn't that heavy though it has a 6000maH battery. HOWEVER I am a bit skeptical of the battery. It offers a monster battery and despite not being a a heavy nor even a moderate gamer, my battery life doesn't look promising. with the medium power saver mode on, I'm just managing to make it function for around 24 hours. Which would include maximum 3 hours of Netflix/Prime. I don't know if it's the best the phone offers, but since the highlight factor of the phone was the battery, i must say it isn't upto my expectation, despite not playing any PubG or other games.

  Too much heating issue, It overheats when you use it, It also overheats anytime randomly even if it is in your pocket.I had to visit Samsung service center, 1 hour after receiving the device. Service center refused to help because I purchased the mobile from Amazon. Amazon refused to return product, Instead they sent replacement after inspection. This is the first time I am feeling sorry to shop from Amazon. 6000mAh battery doesn't last for single day with no gaming, no video streaming and very modest use.The battery drains because of heating. Once used navigation in my Car and had to switch it off after 30 minutes due to over heating....its a safety risk.Tomorrow, I will get replacement mobile and sell it to a shop on Rs2000 less. Will buy other mobile from that shop.I wouldn't recommend this product. I wanted to buy a non China phone but looks like Samsung trying to ride on anti China sentiments and make profits, compromising on quality and safety.Worst thing....Amazon now does not protect interests of its customers. Will never buy Mobiles, tablets or laptops from Amazon08/10/2020: Amazon agreed to return and refund

  STPL has been sending defective phones this is my 3rd phone from same vendor. Amazon is doing nothing and now that I've crossed 10 days i can't return. Phone calls are not going through and some times gets disconnected. I've done all factory reset and tried new sim. Damn I feel ashamed of purchased this from amazon that too from same vendor. I didn't have option to choose another vendor. Amazon has deserted me lifted up its hands

  Before I go into details, let me admit that I was a staunch ""hater"" of Samsung Android phones, specially in the low mid range. The first and last Samsung phone I used was a Galaxy Core, back in 2012. I absolutely hated it, and promised to never buy a Samsung phone ever. But then there was an ad and I purchased this M21.. Samsung again, after 8 years. And during these 8 years, I have used Sony Xperia, Moto G, Redmi 4, Redmi Note 7 Pro. So my review is actually a comparison of those phones with this beast.The major advantage of this phone, compared to my Moto G, is the brilliant sAmoled display with Full HD resolution (not 720p, thank God).Processor is so optimised for this phone that it works like a breeze and stays cool like, unlike my both Redmi's. I dont bother the fact that its not a Snapdragon. Performance and usability is so much optimised that you shall never complain.Battery backup is a perfect two day affair, for more than normal usage. Screen on time is excellent. I can easily go through 2 days even after streaming web series and talking a lot on phone calls.The only thing that bothered me is the finger print sensor. Its not a feather touch one, definitely. But it still works pretty good, once you put your finger on inlt properly.For me, its a very good deal under 15k. Would recommend this to anyone, even when blind folded!

  Was a Nokia fan, Post their debacle moved on as Motorola fan, for last 5 years. Did take s chance to buy a Galaxy M10s last year, for my family. Post the experience  on that, I just bought this Galaxy M21 few weeks back. It was delivered in this Covid situation and was on time. Am actually liking all the features installed. Camera is too cool, long battery hours, great features....having great time.

  So I have got this phone yesterday onlyAnd on basis of one day observation, I am giving the following review1.Camera-3.8 üåüboth front and rear click good pictures2. Battery-4 üåü because battery is great but a little less standby, according to 6000mahI will rather say it to be a 5500 mAh battery3.Chargin- So the phone and the charger, both heats up while chargingI know it is very obvious but still expected better4. Fingerprint sensor-5 üåü Very fast5.Face sensor: works good but requires 30%of brightness to work5. Processor(#pubg)- 4 üåü Processor is strong enough and pubg runs good on hd and ultra but not too strong for extensive gamingFor lite players, it is 4/56. Display. 5 üåü7. Connectivity. 2 üåü *Now this is a problem, I used jio sim and the download speed from play store was too slow and when I used the same SIM on realme c2, it worked quite fastProblems- connectivity and heating while charging

"

  Pros :- Huge Battery- Super Awesome Display- Excellent Cameras- Excellent Build Quality- Good Processor- No Heating problem- Able to play all Games like PUBG and COD- Dedicated SD Card Slot- Light weight- 15 W Super Charger, Once charge huge battery gives 2 days backup.Cons :- No Headsets in the Box- No Protective case in the Box- Plastic Back bodySuper Happy by purchasing Non china mobiles

  Atleast you should have given basic screen guard and transparent phone cover. Now Samsung has even stopped giving earphones along with their phones. Adapter is so slow that it takes  atleast 6 hours to get charged, plus battery back up is not as per expectation. And charging your phone in 8 hrs really sucks. And the only thing they took money for is 6gb ram, 128 gb internal. Please don't buy this product. It is a complete burden

  1st time, ordered a mobile on amazon n got damaged handset..replacement process is very tedious in case of mobiles..there is no system of quality check in amazon I suppose. the packaging was very good but the mobile was defective..they think people are fools to shell out so much money and buy damaged items..hv ordered all the mobiles of our family members thru Flipcart but never faced this problem..just a week ago, had bought samsung galaxy A51 thru flipcart and it works perfectly fine..the worst part is, it was n exchange offer..they hv take away the old mobile n don't hv any mobile nw

  1.Poor finger print,taking long time to unlock,2.Charging is slow,though it is saying fast charging3.Low user interface than other products run on android4.Battery backup is not up to the mark,6000 mah is for marketing purpose infact I also purchased  this for battery ......but ...5.processor okay6. Too much brightness  even in auto condition, should improve in this department7.Sound is less in loud speaker  mode

  Battery: Takes more than 2 Hr to charge fully due to huge battery capacity. Once fully charged, lasts for more than 24 Hr even after 6 hr of extensive use.Camera: Day light pics are awesome but pixels get distorted when image is zoomed even if it's set to 48 megapixel. Image size is huge if 48 megapixel setting is used. In dark room image and selfie are sufficently good with flash. Different aspect ratios available in setting to cover desired witdh and range.Display: Butturly smooth touch. Clarity of content is awesome. Blue light filter option with option to manage opacity is available in quick drop down menu.Sound: DecentUSB wire lenght: 0.5 MTR only. Too small.Pre-installed apps.: Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft  office, different apps of Samsung including samsung store etc. And some Chines apps. It's better to uninstall useless apps on very first day.SIM: Both sim slot support simultaneous LTE facility.Ear phone slot provided at bottom beside charging port.Weight: Light as compared to size.Dual Masaanger facility allow us to active two what's app account simultaneously.No earphone provided.Conclusion: In such a price, lots of good feature provided by this Made in India phone. For regular use, this phone can be choosen.

  I have been a long term Xperia, HTC and Moto user. Consider that this review is from a non Samsung guy who doesn't want to buy a non branded smartphone.Pros :1. Excellent display - The best I have used in the last few years.2. Good battery - Non gaming person will end his day easily with 20% charge still left.3. UI - Could have been more cleaner but bloatware can either be uninstalled or disabled.4. System - Has call recording and various customization features by default which my earlier phones lacked.5. Camera - Could rate it 3.5 out of 5. Takes good photos but lacks 60fps video recording.  So camera rating is not a pro not a con.Cons :1. Design - Plastic body, non premium look, slippery design, fingerprint magnet.2. Charging - Takes 3 hours to charge from 0 to 100%.3. Fingerprint - I feel the positioning of fingerprint sensor is not at the correct place.4. Sensor - It uses front camera as light sensor for auto brightness, hence drains lot of battery until adaptive brightness is turned off.

  If you are looking foa phone for day to day use, this is the phone for you.Battery life is awesome.Amoled display so no compromise there. 1080 videos can be watched on youtube.Biometric sensor is bit slow just like face recognition, but not that slow.Camera is good for outdoors. Slowmo flickers when taken indoor.Overall phone is the best you can get at this price or even under 20k range. (Unless you want to go for chinese brands)Edit : After 1 week of use I experienced a lag in notification panel while using camera.PS : don't completely drains your phones battery charge it when you can.

  Not Happy with Amazon for this purchase.Faulty product delivered.Just after one month, Screen is on but not responding at all. Samsung service centre has told it is showing water damage!There were no water damage chances at my place for last one month, and I am pretty sure this damage is more older.Actually the water damage is even before the ordering thru Amazon, this handset already had water in it.I know that company will not take responsibility now and that is the reason I am surely going to report this fraud to everyone.Samsung is still a Fraud !Hope that Amazon helps here!

  After three months of extensive usage, I am quite satisfied with the overall performance of this phone. Both the front and back cameras click crystal-clear pictures. The AMOLED display is good, and the battery backup is quite efficient.But the only negative point that needs to be brought to notice of the company is a minor heating issue. Whenever I open the camera, the upper portion of the phone heats up quickly, making it seem quite dangerous.To sum it up, this is a good phone in this budget that anyone can choose to buy.

"

  Phone  m21 6Gb delivered on 17 June, it was good suddently from 13 July the phone charging slot started heating up.Now the phone is not charging at all. It only charges when connected to laptop or PC but some thing starts melting.Some thing have been burnt inside.And the Faulty replace is just for 10 Day form Purchase.Samsung India is answerable for this, this shows the level of QA is done by Samsung IndiaRecommendation : Do not purchase this phone. This is second faulty product in last 7 years. I wasted my money investing on it.

  REVIEW AFTER USAGE OF 2 MONTHS.Varient: 128gbCamera: The back camera clicks great photos even in low light. The colour and depth of photos perfect. The front camera is also better than average.Battery: The time taken to charge is about 2 and half hours( because its a large battery 6000 mah). With average usage (i.e without gaming), it lasts almost 1 day 20 hours. I used the phone for watching videos and accessing tutorial.Fingerprint: Its quick and accurate. Before this i used a MI handset. The fingerprint sensor is better than previous one.Heating problem: Its gets heated with heavy usage. Pretty normal with average budget phones,i guess.Processor: The phone is fast and works smoothly. Switches like a butter between multiple applications.Look and feel: It fits great on the hand. Looks decent. It has a good grip, doesn't slip from hand.Its the best choice under 15k. I'm really happy with my handset. Samsung doesn't disappoint.

"
"

  Writing this after one month of use. Overall handset is claiming to have all the features for a budget phone. But I'm not so satisfied with its performance. Camera images quality is not so ""wow"". Worst problem I'm facing with network connectivity, regular network and mobile data. Issues like no network, voice breaking, call drops, delay in connecting call. I'm not getting signals at any places inside my house which was not so problematic with my previous phone redmi note 5 pro. Battery is good, since it is new phone.

"
"

  Box contents-Device, user manuals, sim card ejector needle, adapter and charging cable.The cable is bit small. Could have been longer.First impression-Felt it slightly heavier than its siblings probably because of huge battery. It's worth it, considering the battery performance.Display-New shiny blue body toy with huge full screen display and water drop notch. Looks fabulous. Amazing crisp clear display with punchy colors(although the colors are bit too punchy sometimes, especially primary colors) and built in dark mode and blue light filter (to be swited on manually)Display is pretty snappy, refresh rate is pretty fast in this segment.Camera-Triple cam with 48mp, wide angle works better than Samsung M30. Camera module is main attraction of the phone. Looks neat.Finger print reader is quite fast, and opens up in milliseconds.Overall it's amazing package for the budget definately recommended.Samsung is giving tough competition to chinese brands.

  its camera is so hezzy and poor quality camera ever seen in my life,no other adapter or cable or dual pen drive fit to this model except it's charging cable data is not transfarable. charging spped is so slow. fake product given by advertisement. plz do not buy this product if you do not want to suffer like me.I am requested to amazone plz expose my review only good rating reviews are shown below the review list for their best selling.pen drive  otg another charger not support .customer support bad amazon....bad phone cheated each and every people.

  If you want a non Chinese mid range phone under 15k Go for it :)A good quality mid range phone for 15k (6gb,128gb) If you got any old phone in working condition to exchange then it will be helpful. I exchanged a old Redmi 5A and final offer price I got was 13k which is a great deal.The phone is from a South Korean based company and it gives amazing battery life with that 6000mah capacity. Excellent full HD superAMOLED screen panel. Triple sim slot. Option for choosing 2g, 3g, 4g network separately. Decent camera performance and smooth Samsung OneUI. The processor is not that amazing but the same Exynos 9611 is used from phones ranging 13k to 25k models by Samsung so its a good choice for M21. I will say M21 is better than M30s which is 2k more than M21 but both are same to same in all aspects.

  I will comment on this phone after 10 days of usage .....let us talk about it point wise...1) Display: Just flawless.....the crisp and contrast in the colours......if u wannna binge webseries and movies....Just go for it!2) Fingerprint: it's NOT SUPER FAST but it's REALLY QUICK......3) Performance: Awesome....not such lag observed .....okaay I am not a gamer....played pubg for abt 1 hr at a stretch......in HD and HIGH...it was infact the recommended graphics by default...No such lag and smooth performance....4) Camera: the back camera is decent.....but the front camera struggles to capture details....I must say if u apply the filters given to u by Samsung...IT IMPROVES THE DETAILS and gives u comparatively better pics than ORIGINAL mode......Hope Samsung fixes it through software update..5) Battery: DECENT but not EXCELLENT...u will get backup somewhat more than 5000mah.6)Value for money: it is value for money!!!!!!üòâU can go for it!!

"
"

  The phone is good if you get it in a deal. Its camera is quite good , clicks great daytime images and good nighttime pics.Camera processing speed Is a bit slow. Display is top notch and colors pop out. Sound quality from speakers is little flat and less as per my liking . Haptics are pretty bad and does not feel good while typing. It's made of plastic but looks good with skin. And finally the exynos 9611 is now pretty old and not good. It heats up quite a lot, phone suffers stutters while multitasking and cannot play games in good graphics. Other cons might be nitpicking but processors really based. Although I don't play .uch games and for regular usage and content consumption it's good.Made in India :)

"
"

  Battery life is amazing, more then 12 hours screen on time in youtube watching.Charging speed could be better.When you charge in switch off phone charges more quickly compared to in on conduction.Camera quality is decent üëåüëåüëå.I brought it for 12699 now price increase to 13499...It's a superb deal for me.

"
"

  Over-all build quality is good, camera as super.Battery capacity is high but needs an optimization update, however it will work fine for more than 36 hours with normal usage.Face detection is excellent.Works Super smooth even after a week.Gorilla glass 3 is there however gorilla glass 5 could have been used.Screen quality is superb, auto brightness needs better adaptation.You can find better usage of AI technology in this phone from audio adaptation to live transcription.It is a perfect phone one can get in this price range, specially if you are seeking to not to buy a low quality Chinese phone.

"
"

  Steal the deal ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èI m a regular user i dont do gaming purchased this one to watch series and other content bcz of its display, so the Device is really good in this budget....display is awesome...no lagging issues or any other heating problems in day to day tasks or while charging.....takes around 2 hours to get charge fully from 20% only con is...camera and image processing could be more improved bcz it gives a whitish shade to skin tone and overall image lookes a bit whitish...so saturation need to be improved....otherwise its a great great device at this budgetüòä

  The best phone in this price category. Everything is awesome. Battery lasts 2 days perfectly. Good camera and UI is very clean. Go for it.

  Using from last 12 Days. Phone is very good for basic day to day use. No Lags in day to day operations. This phone suit who use YouTube, WhatsApp and some other lite apps.Pros:1. Big Battery2. Amoled Display3. Good Camera Pictures in Natural light only.Cons:1. Worst Plastic Quality ‚Äì Phone came with minor scratches2. Worst Selfie Camera ‚Äì Struggle a lot in Artificial light specially at Night3. Missing Auto Focus ‚Äì which is a basic feature even in a 6K phone.4. No Headphones, No Plastic case, not happy with Samsung cost cuttings.5. Battery charging take around 3h:15m from 0 to 100%. Better to charge in Night.6. Gorilla Glass 3 protection ‚Äì I assume it is out of date in today‚Äôs time.7. Not Good for gaming.

  Good mobile. I using 15 days good battery backup. I'm playing free fire game smooth play good. Camera outdoor good but indoor not good. Display colour view amazing. Looking super mobile premium feel I love this mobile.

"
"

  Overall a good phone in this range.If you are Samsung admirer like me then you can go for this one. I have bought 6gb/128gb version and happy with it. Battery lasts for 54hrs on an average. Fast charging takes 1hr 20min to charge this tiny giant. Charging adapter should be more powerful when you are giving fast charging option. Camera good. There is no headphone and back cover in the box which is disappointing in this budget.

  Absolutely amazing purchase. Samsung has done a great job with this mobile.pros.displaybatterypricingno ads.conswell cons are not that concerning.loudspeaker could have been better (But still adequate)fingerprint sensor does not work if finger is bit sweaty.overall its a must buy.10/10

  I am writing this review after a month of usage. I usually use my phones just for browsing and calling purposes, not a gamer. Even then I face a lot of lag issues, the response rate is very bad on clicking an icon. Sound is also not that loud compared to my Nokia 5.1 Plus phone earlier. I feel this buy is a let down even from Nokia 5.1 Plus. Except the humoungous display size, I don't think its a good phone at all. Regretting this buy!!!

  I had brought this phone a week ago, initially I had faced battery some backup issues, I raised a return request and a replacement was provided and after using two days I had observed the mobile has issues, it operates on its own wish I did check the settings and restarted the phone a couple of time, however no change the device behaved the same manner. Finally I gave a called the Amazon CS they did try their level best to trouble shoot and finally even they gave suggested me for a refund.This clearly indicate this line of phone have a issues, which I never expected from a brand like Samsung.Buy it at your own risk.Regards

"
"

  Only positives - Great screen and good battery life.Negatives:- Hangs a lot and I only use it for calling and WhatsApp- If I leave it for half a day unattended, it restarts automatically and hangs at the boot screen. Stays there for hours if I don't force restart it.- Camera is ok, not that great.- Phone feels very heavy in hand.- Loses signal in the standby mode and only pulls receives the internet signals when unlocked.I made the mistake jsut because of the Samsung name. If possible, avoid this series. The RealMes and Mis are much better.

  The Great innovation from Samsung!!Amazing Samsung m21 having world class super amoled display, the Samsung 1UI is having amazing features which is superb & for the 1UI operating system just like butter no lags, but fingure print reader works blazing fast, A real monster üëæ battery, also monster üëæ 48 mp camera with Cristal clear image quality, this is the most beautiful phone in this segment. Great work done by team samsung. Thank you Samsung

  I bought the midnight blue, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for myself. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since i am not a heavy user unlike others, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for me- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover i was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence i was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9611 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.

  Been using it for a while after transitioning for LG G6. I have to say I am impressed by the built, speed and BATTERY LIFE of this device. 2 whole days battery life with heavy usage.Pro:1. Camera is good for the price2. SUPER AMOLED display is very sharp and crispy.3. Wide angle camera is a good feature.4. Monster battery life5. Hyper stable video is like a gimbal on its ownCon1. Fingerprint sensor sometimes has issues but face unlock work suprising well.2. Cannot switch between normal and wide angle camera in between recording.Overall a good buy for a medium range phone coming from a non chinese market thats MADIE IN INDIA.

  Phone is good but a very big problem is there when I insert sim card in phone then I found internet is working... I have tried 4 different different isp sim cards and complete all required network setting Or sim setting but net is not working but when I insert these sim Cards in another phone it works very well gives me 5 to 6 mbps speed but in this samsung phone internet isn't working....I am very frustrated from this network issue...  üòî

  Undoubtedly you can go for it. Reason for purchase1. Display - You can't find this type display under 20000. Excellent display. Bright, colourfull, punchy.2. Bettery - Best bettery backup in this price range.3 Camera - Excellent camera, best picture clarity, full of details and colourful, punchy.Charger little bit slow, take time to charge but battery backup awesome.

  All the people who are in doubt about this phone that whether they should but it or not ..... I tell u that this phone is damn Amazing.... The camera ...the display...the battery is outstanding..... It's super smooth touch and the superb UI gives it a A class performance... Even if ur a pub g lover go for it... It just lags SOMETIMES in HIGHEST quality .... But if u will lower just one level of quality...it will give outstanding performance..... IN THIS PRICE RANGE ITS AN AWESOME PHONE

  First all M series phones are made in India. If you are looking good budget phones other than MI, Oppo, Vivo, then Samsung M21/M31 is phone which you can buy without any doubts.Dispay- 5/5Full HD screen plus SAmoled features gives better experience of picture qualityBattery 3/5Yes battery is 6000mAh and performs good but I observed that fast is not work properlyOs/processer 4.5/5Ui android 10Fingerprint/ face lock 3/5Very slow as compared to other phonesCamera 3.5/5Front and back camera are good but if compared to latest phones of MI, then you may disappoint about camera picture qualityOverall it is good budget phone.

  Bought this product after comparing the specs. To be Frank after receiving the phone ita a let down.1. The wifi connectivity has problem, reported to Amazon replacement is on the way.2. Bluetooth connection it takes exactly 132 seconds for the phone to detect and connect to an already paired bluetooth device which happens in other handsets in a matter of seconds.3. It boasts of 6 GB ram checked the memory first and it shows 3 gb of 6 gb available with 550 reserved for existing apps. Mind it this is on the first inspection even before installing any apps from play store.4. Phone gets stuck and has lags which is not expected from a brand new phone.5. Battery after two days use it's normal and drains quickly mind it I could install much dueto  the wifi issue it give can hour or two more than 4000 Mah battery and nothing more.6. My choice came to Samsung phone coz of the drive not to buy a Chinese brand Xiomi but in comparison to their note 8 pro the M21 fades away in terms of speed,quality and the overall performance.7. Phone is hanging just for opening chrome .Just to add Amazon folks were quick to replace the faulty set, now the bluetooth and wifi issue is resilved

  I am posting this review after using the mobile for 24 day. At first i thought its a decent one, but my mobile stopped working now. So, I approched new by samsung service centre they said that they need to replace the ""MOTHERBOARD"". Come on , a brand new mobile after using it for only 24 days the motherboard is not working. I Request amazon to extent the replacement period for the Electronics product which they sell to a ""MONTH ATLEST"".When I asked for replacement they said they can only repair the malfunctioned part and not replace it. HOW CAN I EVEN ACCEPT THIS, AFTER REPAIR IT ALMOST A REFURNISHED PRODUCT.  I PAID FOR A NEW MOBILE NOT FOR A REPAIRED  PRODUCT.

"
"

  Great product by Samsung at lower prices. Few points to mention after using for a week.1. Great super amoled display.2. Smooth UI on Android 10 latest version.3. Good camera with 20MP front. Camera experience is above average.4. Slight heating near speaker grill when playing audio. Speaker quality is average.5. Fast finger print sensor and face unlock.6. Full Charging took 2.5hr at least.7. Battery last for 2 days for normal use. Screen on time about 10hr on an average.8. Good processor and RAM management.9. It is not a gaming phone.10. Use tampered glass and back cover to protect the phone. Not included in box, purchase separately.11. Samsung brand value to consider.12. Over all good phone capable of doing daily normal task. Marking: 8/10.

  I was bit hesitant to buy Samsung Galaxy M-21. The reason being I was more interested in compact designs and small size phones. I used to have MI phones for the same reasons. But first time, I switched to Samsung and believe me I am more than satisfied.First and foremost thing, the big battery. Once charged, it is lasting for three whole days!  (on a medium use).  I check social networks, emails, messages regularly though don't call much. I am not a gamer too. But still 3 long days battery is worthy. Further, no battery heating issues on charging unlike with MI phones.Secondly, the AMOLED display. It is vivid, bright and sharp.Next comes the Camera. I read previews that the camera quality was so so. But look at the shots taken by me using Live Focus feature. The pics will speak for themselves.About performance, no issues... smooth and slick.I feel it brilliantly falls in  Value for Money category with Made in India tag.

  Amazing product.. switched from Xiaomi to Samsung as the device is fully assembled and manufactured in India at Samsung Factory, NCR and the company isn't ChineseThe product is quite power-packed the 48MP camera makes every shot precise and uniqueAndroid 10 feels too goodBattery life: well 6000mAh speaks enough about the battery life max to max it drops to 70%The sAMOLED makes video streaming gorgeousDolby Atmos.. the name is enough, people might feel choice of words odd but indeed the audio is like 'people are standing in front of you and singing the song' üòÜThe 4+64 varient seemed sufficient for me as I've 32 SD card plugged in tooTo all the Xiaomi users Samsung is doing better in the segment now.. go for it!Amazon prime delivery was good too received the order 2days before scheduledAmazing purchase experience üëåüëç

  Not a bad phone at all...Considering the price point 13999 ..little over priced ...Pros1. Samsung display and the viewing angles are good2. Audio is good compared to Chinese craps3. Video viewing experience is good4. Call quality is goodAverage:1. Camera2. Battery backup is less when compared to 5000 mah capacity phones3.  Though no lags butnot for gamer..I don‚Äôt play games and I feel it‚Äôs good to go for daily usage4. Price point should be 11-12k max ...Options considered before buying this phone1. Nokia 5.3 ( rejected due to 720p display  and average camera)2. Poco m2 , poco m2 pro, redmi note 9 pro,......after seeing the device not at all impressed with UI ....and sound quality is worst even with Apple ear phones ...

  Review after 2 weeks.No issue till yet.1. Battery :- 9/10Two day battery at normal use.2.Display:- 10/10Super AMOLED Display The main reason to buy this phone awesome color with full hd.3.

  I bought this for 14k.  For 14k, you can definitely get very good specs in other brands. (Got HDFC 10% instant cashback).  Delivery on time as promised.I was very keen to avoid chinese phone and want to go with made in india phone.So left with very little choice among this 3 - Asus / Nokia / Samsung.  Asus not available online, Nokia has very limited battery and reviews not great.I generally like Samsung build quality, and now it is made in India, so decided to go with this.Its decent enough, good phone.  May not be value for money though considering the spec with other chinese brands.But good build quality, and comes with Android 10 / On UI.  So far getting patch updates regularly.Battery may not be as impressive as it claims. But still serves 1.5 days so far.Exynos 9611 SoC with 4GB RAM is average, not great, not bad.Display is good as well.Buy screen guard and back cover as it is fingerprint magnet.

  I have decided to put my review after 1.5 months of usage, I opted samsung only for a single reason that it's a non chinese brand..Now, talking about the performance of the phone, so far this comes out to be a good phone on all the parameters and there are no lags in the phone.. Camera quality is satisfactory and good with fair details, both front and back cameras will give close to natural colored pics, one should not expect DSLR in 14000 bucks..Battery back up is decent, you will get one full day i.e.24 hrs back up if you are heavy user, with moderate use u will get little over 30-32 hrs of back upFingerprint sensor is not very fast and prompt but it serves the purpose very wellProcessor who cares about whether its snapdragon or exynos, all hyped created by online reviewers, if you are a normal user and dont play heavy games you will not be able to figure out the difference between the two processors and this processor works fine and gives good performance in daily usage with no lagsScreen is super Amoled which is the USP of this phone at 14000 bucks, picture quality is good and colour contrast is also quite punchy..I dont think any other company provides the S Amoled display at this price range, I have compared the picture resolution of M21 with one plus 7 and there is a difference of 19-20  only  and do consider the pricing as well while comparing this phone with a phone having  price of more than 36000 more than double the price of this phone , so that ways this is bang on..Audio quality is good with ear phonesCall reception, network connectivity works fine with no lagsAreas of improvement-No LED  indicators which is quite disappointing at this priceLooks and build quality is not that good, quite simple with no glass back Charging takes 2.5 hours to fully charge the phoneGo for non chinese product with very little compromise over looksGo for this non chinese brand over chinese phone and you will not regret ur choiceI did a lot of research before purchasing this one.. so samsung M21 overall offers a good package with outstanding picture quality and color contrastIn case you find this helpful in your decision making, do like this review.

  Firstly this phone comes with almost all the features you need in a phone. I'm a teenager so I know. If you compare specs all the time you won't ever be able to decide but here the company name says a lot as Indians have trust with Samsung.Pros: Good battery back upThe camera is up to mark especially night view and wide-angle viewHaving a big battery didn't felt like a heavy phoneAlready comes with many inbuilt settings to play withA faster chipset in this price rangeSpeaker sound is well more than what we expectDual apps availableViewing angles are great as we get SUPER amolded screenCons: face lock is not up to the markMore charge time but I feel its worth it tooBeing honest nothing more till now cause it been just a few weeksOverall I would recommend you to buy it. Valur for money :)

  Build quality is great. The phone looks amazing. Easy to carry and handle. For the size, the phone is surprisingly  light. Camera is very good. Battery life is good and the phone easily gives one full day of regular usage. Screen is vivid and immersive. Fingerprint scanner is quick and accurate.  Charging time is little long even with fast charge. Lightening  charge would be an awesome addition.

  Writing this review after around 15 days of extensive use.1) Battery: Battery life is the best in this budget. Once charged, backup is atleast 1.75 complete days. It takes around 2.5 hours to charge this gigantic battery with the in-box 15 watt charger.2) Camera: Well comparing with other phones in this price range, this is simply the best. Also, Samsung Galaxy M31 is also a good option, but didn't find any difference between this two when I compared the images.3) Processor: Both the GPU and CPU are decent enough. Not a PubG fan, but to test it once, I ran a few rounds of PugG and Fifa Mobile. Didn't lag even once.4) Overall Texture Quality: Body is made of plastic. This could've been better if it was single metallic body. The rear look is not so great, but anyways you can always cover it with Back covers of your choice.Overall Rating : 4.5/5Cons:1) They should've given 20 Watts charger, as it takes 2.5 hours with the current charger to fully charge it from 0 - 100%.

  This is the best Smartphone under 15K . Don't even think twice... just go for it.Pros:1. Best Display:  FHD+ super amoled display is far better than IPS display. If you start using it , you will never like any IPS lcd phone. Colours are very attractive in super amoled. Nowadays I feel IPS lcd displays dull.2. 6000mah battery lasts more than one day even after heavy usage .3. Camera is best in daytime. Even night mode is better than any phone under 15k. So, you won't be disappointed on camera.4. Samsung One UI is clean and ad free. There you won't be disturbed by ads . Nowadays Chinese phones show full of ads. Samsung is great by this way.5. THIS IS NON-CHINESE! This makes m21 more safe and secure.6. Exynos 9611 is not a bad processor as YouTube reviewers says. It can handle high graphics game in high settings .7. The camera has some great features like colour pic...Main object remains colourful while background becames black&white(watch the image). This looks great!... so onCons:1. There is no earphone or backcase. Company should give atleast backcover.2. Length of cable is short.3. Exynos processors are not very good for playing  long time. Still you can play PUBg  4-5 hrs but Mobile heats up a little .Final verdict: If you have a budget less than 15k, you should buy this. This is better than Chinese phones. Don't listen to YouTube reviewers,  Chinese companies pays them for promotion.  M21 is better than any phone at this price!

  Overall a good phone - 6k MAH battery with 6GB, 128GB in 15k + 500 for accessories is not that bad.Battery lasts 24+ hours with wifi ON continuously.Looks good, sleek and stylish. But with cover, every phone looks ugly and bulky, same goes here as well.Camera configuration appears very high but it failed to impress me so far. Didnt find it very great.Speakers - it sounds little cacophonous.  It feels like it has only 2 volume settings, same low for first 50% and same loud for remaining 50%, nothing in between.  And it doesnt appear to give any sound effects, sounds something odd compared to my previous  phone.After the OS upgrade, realised that whatsapp or messenger calls do not show up on the screen, it only rings. So I have to first open WhatsApp and then tap the top of screen to get options to pick up. Not sure whether it's an issue with phone OS or WhatsApp, Messenger. Since, with earlier phone as well, I had issues with these two services where it wouldn't even ring at my side unless I have opened them. But the caller would hear the phone buzzing. Here, at least it rings.All in all, depending on your usage, feature that matters to you, make your purchase decision.And yes, the box says its ""Made In India"" so you may want to forego some of the drawbacks I mentioned above. Given a chance I can buy it again.

  It's practically the same phone as M31 from inside , only difference being camera quality and back plastic finish.I don't care about the back plastic finish as i always put covers on my phones - which you should do too. This is a damn good phone, don't overthink it just get it.When i was buying this phone i was really confused which one to get -M31, Redmi note 9 pro, etc.  But i took the leap and got this one - and i'm really happy. Don't be too critical if you want a robust phone that gets the job done.I was blown away by the AMOLED screen and whenever i see some images on it i still can't believe how good the screen is. At night the blacks are ABSOLUTELY black - an image with black background will look like it's floating if you're in a pitch dark room - point being the contrast is amazing.Camera is great, could be better - but that could be said for literally every phone. On this budget itna hi milega.Battery life is GREAT. I use it mildly for whatsapp, instagram, casual games, google apps, camera etc. and i honestly forget to charge my phone in 2 days, and i charge it on 3rd day morning.I recommend getting 6gb ram 128gb storage version.Just get it - don't think too much, don't waste time comparing, just get it.Highly recommend.

  I am a student of BTech, in side I am doing freelancing. From the my earnings I bought this Samsung M21 for my dad as a birthday gift. And it was amazing experience. Don't think too much Samsung is Samsung. Yes it's price is little bit high compare then MI. I have Redmi 7 Pro. I like MI device. But after using samsung m21 I can say. Go for samsung M21. I had planning of buy Redmi 9 Prime for dad. But then I changed my decision to Samsung M21. And it was perfect decision üòåPros- Battery Life- Icon color & Video quality- Very responsive touch- Camera quality- Better UI & Amazing display- No ads- Call quality, wifi strength is good- Sound is good and in terms of display samsung is always best.- Good for rough & tough use- Made in IndiaüáÆüá≥Cons- Design should be better- At 15k price point back design is should be more better with Gorilla glass like Redmi 7 Pro- Finger print is quite difficult sometime- No access of Major samsung apps like Samsung Pay- Limited colours of range- No backcase in box.- If you are a MI user then display will be a little bit yellow in compare to MI device.But My dad loves the phone‚ù§Ô∏è, he is too much Happy because I have gifted this phone to him from my earnings.

  Overall, the phone is quite a decent one. It has amazing battery life and a wonderful AMOLED screen. But these are the only things that can be considered above average.What really dissappointed me is the camera quality. The photos taken in good lighting are really great, but those in moderate light suffer. Low light photographs suffer the most as they are abysmal. You can use open camera with noise reduction to get somewhat better quality. Which tells you that it's Samsung itself that are limiting the output of a certainly good camera hardware setup.Moving on to the fingerprint sensor. It's fine. It's fast when it works, but you need to cover it completely with your fingertips, which annoys me. Other phones, and older ones too, in this price range have a much better fingerprint sensor.The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks. That's it. Samsung seems to have just one processor. It's so stupid that they put Exynos 9611 in every phone these days. You cannot play games that well. I tried Asphalt at default settings and there was lag and frame drops. I do not game much, so it's fine for me.The speaker is not sufficiently loud.I like Samsungs OneUI. It is clean and well optimised. I say this coming from MIUI11. What I do miss is the network speed option in the status bar and the three finger screenshot gesture, which were available in MIUI.The 6000mAh battery is the highlight of this phone. The downside is the charging speed. But that's OK for me. The phone lasts 1.5 to 2 days based on your usage.Finally the screen. It is something I have no complaints about. Bright, punchy and great for media consumption. The screen was a major factor for me to buy this phone.

  1.Display is Super No doubt about it.2.Camera is good.3.Battery is good enough but not that much good as per expectations from 6000mah battery.4.No irritating adds like other chines smartphones5.user interface is goood6.Finger print sensor works well and fast7.Battery drains fast  in PUBG game I dont if its common in all other spartphone.And its manufactured in India (not all parts but as compared to other chines phones Samsung manufactures most of the parts in India) that is the reason I bought Samsung by paying little bit extra to samsung than chines phones.

  This phone is having best of the best features except for some small features which would have made the phone awesome to have. But without those features also this is the best phone to have currently in the market. I missed notification and charging indicator in the phone. Battery performance is not upto the mark. I was expecting more battery life for 6000mAh. But I have to charge atleast once a day.

  Hello guys . This is Anubhab . I am basically a tech friendly guy. So I want here an there to find a perfect phone for me. And also I made tech videos in bengali. Anubhab' Tech.At first I describe the feeling when I got it into the hand. The mobile gives you a reliable feeling at first. It is because of Samsung brand. When you boot your phone the UI gives you a clean and clear look with no blotwares or ads. Which you gets in other Chinese smartphone. It is basically runs on One UI and andriod 10.After that it comes to camera Samsung's camera is too good. Various types of mode is available here on video recording, like slow mo ,super slow mo, steady mode etc. 48 mp camera tooks a very detailed pictures. And front is also good . But you get 4:3 frame in 48 mp as usually like other mobiles too.Then comes the battery . It is a 6000 mah monster battery. It canes with 15 watt charger which complete your charging at least 2 hours to 2.30 hours. I recommend you to turn on airplane mode while charging. This thing will fast your charging speed. Display is quite impressive . Super amoled dispay drains battery lesser. Biometrics. The fingerprint sensor is fast but face unlock is slightly less fast. But it doesn't matter.Gameplay: I play pubg in Hdr and ultra frame rate . The game play is slightly laggy. But if you play it with HD and Ulta frame rate it will perform smooth . And I also mention that if you play pubg in smooth setting then you will get the extreme frame rate. Which I used to play .Thats all . Thank you

  This is my first samsung phone. I purchased this because I don't want to purchase a chinese mobile. But interestingly, this phone is great surprise for me. Light weight, superb display n battery. I watch many videos in youtube n watch films on Netflix, it's just perfect for me as the amoled display is awesome. I need not to charge it frequently n I use it all the time without any issues. Camera quality, I find it better than Xiaomi phones in this price range, ya true.

"
"

  its really very ""kaam Chalau"" phone, in this range, and as i expected about the touch panel of samsung, its little bit hard touch and also for fingerprint is not so much quick responsive and the software which are pre-loaded are not so much useful, and talking about the speed, it is very disappointing, while updating and installing the software it takes so much time, specially from the samsung store, and the theme store is also not good, all are purchase items there, and no ringtone download is there. Only thing is the best in this mobile is that the camera and screen quality.volume buttons are bit higher to reach. one most important features is missing from this mobile is capturing the screen shot, no shortcut key in quick panel, as samsung should think about this, traditional screen shot system is there, press and hold the volume down and power key simultaneously.

  It is truely a great experience with this device. In one word it is awesome!! Camera quality  is very good. Output speaker sound is loud, distinct and the microphone  of this  phone is sensitive enough. Display is bright and eye soothing. Finger print readers is works quite well. Battery life is... o my god!! More than what i expected... 2 days easy battery life with normal usage... with heavy usage it can last upto one day at least.... overall a mustbuy phone.. i want to recommend  it to all... thank you amazon for in time delivery...

  I am writing this review after 3 months of usage. I am not a gamer but sometimes play. So the reader should take that into consideration. Battery is good. Even battery be 15% it will works for about 1 hour with hotspot open. Take around 2:30 to 3 hrs to charge. Camera is Decent. You can sometimes find some problem with network connection where there is weak connectivity.Cant say much about sound quality but for normal user it is good(atleast it is good enough for me). Before buying this phone i read this is not best suited for gamers.

  M21 is an average phone with nothing special about it. Everything about it is average.  Here I want highlight that this phone does not have knox facility hence lot of samsung add on programme does not work. I was eager for Secure Folder but later came to know it is knox based and hence cannot run. Many M series Samsung phone does not have knox and runs on One UI Core.Choise is yours

"
"

  M21 is excellent budget smartphone and competes with most Chinese brands on specifications and price front. The display brightness and  battery life are excellent. My only complaint to Samsung is they have not included fast charger with product. It takes hours to charge with built in charger. But when I used my other fast charger, the mobile started charging fast.Further, I found it slow as against my Galaxy S9+ and it is obvious as Galaxy s9+ is premium category phone and outperforms M series on all fronts. Overall, I liked the phone. Worth investing for middle range.

"
"

  6 GB ram,128 GB ROM, AMOLED display for Samsung phone 15k is good pricing.*This phone is especially for lite to moderate users.* great display* decent battery life* lag-free ONE UI 2 (compared to older Samsung phones)* if you push this phone for heavy games, it will heat up a bit and frame drops (Not a good phone for PUBG)

"
"

  Camera quality is good. Front camera or back camera, both perform well in day light and perform decent is low light with flash. Built quality is also fair as it doesn‚Äôt look that bad. Battery life isn‚Äôt that good as it‚Äôs 6000mah but performs like 4500-5000mah but with power saver on it performs really good. Display is amazing.Fingerprint reader is super fast and face unlock works good in day light.User interface is really nice and well organized and not many stupid apps.Processor wise also the phone works well and you can play PUBG for 2 hours continuous without any problem.

"
"

  Good and decent mobile handset,But GST increase price is high than launching price,But Handset performance is Very Good for Normal to moderate use.Camera quality is also Good,I recommend to buy this mobile under this price range, Good mobile than other Chinese Handset with fake(made in India label).I suggest this phone in this price segment.

"

  Its jusa a super product.... love to ise a whole day without charging.... camera is awesome ... and the speed of the phone is good. Im a shop keeper i dont play much games , so its very useful for my daily business call records and online payments.... thanks and the price is bit heigh. But i can compromise to support for my country.

  *Unbiased and True Experience Only*Since Samsung has understood the Game of Midrange Smartphone Market. Here is my Take on M21Pros:1. Battery Life : Believe me , You will miss charging the Phone alot. About 8-9 Hours of Screen time is Guranteed on a Regular Usage(No-Gaming). The Battery is Much efficient, Each % gives about 10 mins of Screen Time.2. Processor : Except for Gaming, It won't Lag in your Daily Usage. Excellent Response time.3. Display: The Only Reason of me Buying this Device was SAMOLED Display. If you haven't used Amoled yet, Go Experience it now.4. UI : One UI is is like butter + Samsung gives you soo much control over device including Native VPN, APPLOCK etc.Charging: People are whining for 15W charging, Believe me its more than Enought. This phone will give you 2 days battery on a Moderate Usage, So you charging this once in two days for 2 Hours is Equal to a Your Friend Charging his Twice in 2 days for 1+1 Hour.Cons: Since I am Not a Gamer, Haven't Found any Cons in Phone. But yeh Plastic Back is a Fingerprint  Magnet and is prone to Damage so I suggest you go for Ringke Cover for (Rs. 899). You don't wan't to give 9K for Amoled Display so invest in BackCover.*Gamers, Stay Away, Not for you.*For-Photography LoversBig Battery LoversUI loversand SpeciallyEntertainment (Movies/Videos/Music) Lovers.Update: Camera App Lags when you try to close it. It clicks Blank/Black Pictures Many times.  Battery is Superb.

  Worst phone with this high price. I am patriot so did not purchase Chinese phone but this samsung phone can not be replacement of even MI low budget phones. Camera quality is not as good as 48mp should be and can not talk with anyone on speaker mode ( too much low volume). Will never recommend anyone to buy this phone with hard earned money.

"
"

  Not recommendedThis phone is full of specs + best non Chinese phone under 15000But it's software is not that goodPROS1) CameraCamera is awesome. No need to wait for camera to focus on the object.Lots of camera mode available in the camera app.2) DisplayThe sAMOLED screen is awesome. The blue light filter is awesome. FHD+ resolution is good. The screen feels smooth but ruined after using the screen guard. You get an option for increasing sensitivity.3) UIOne UI 2.0 is full of pros and cons.It packed with Antivirus software.(McAfee)But some features are reduced from original one UI 2.0

"
"

  Battery : Battery is good and gives an adequate performance.Processor :  I didn't found any lag in my day to day usage. I am not gamer but it fulfills all my daily tasks without any lag.Display : It is just beautiful and looks extra ordinarycharging : charging takes around 3 hours to get fully charged but that is ok for 6000 maH battery and in the current budget. one can keep adding the budget if he is keen to increase the features.Samsung UI : Samsung comes with some bloatwares which can either be uninstalled or disabled but the UI is good and contains lot of additional features.Sound : Atmos is supported through headphones which gives pleasant experience and speakers are loud enough. Can be slow for the Chinese phone users.Final Verdict : For a normal user who wants a beautiful display , powerful battery and a non Chinese phones to avoid the spyware on your activities then this phone is great phone in budget.

  A great smart phone...Nothing to say about its display...fingerprint scanner is fast but i must say that the face unlocking is a little bit slow...battery is really 'Watta Monster'...15 watt first charging with USB type C is not bad...it takes about 2 and half hour to get completely charged (0 to 100%)...and drainage of battery depends on usage...but light usage of the phone  can run it for almost 2 days...camera quality is great and the selfies are quite good and sharp...video quality is also good and the noise cancelling mic is also doing a good job...sound is obviously loud but not as good as expected ...but in terms of gaming like pubg mobile or Call of Duty mobile I found it lagging sometimes but not much.This smartphone is not for gaming but it is for students who needs to do online classes as it has a monster battery...and also for its sAmoles display...I also chose it as a student...If you are a student then go for it...

  Liked It for some reasons‚Ä¶.1.The Galaxy M21 is a smartphone that offers a massive 6,000mAh battery.2.It‚Äôs got a great AMOLED display with HD streaming support .3.This smartphone is extremely lightweight.Thanks to the glossy nature of the plastic, the phone is very susceptible to fingerprints.4.The 48-megapixel main sensor on the Galaxy M21 is excellent. With sufficient lighting, the pixel-binned photos came out great.

"
"

  Samsung M21, 6 GB, 128 GB RAM. EXYNOS 10 NM Processor, Samsung 48 MP main back camera. Most importantly Amoled display with AOD. No back cover in case. Good price. The brand is better for people who want to use it for long period. It will stay with you at least for 3 years. Don't fall for the 5G processors, 5G won't be there in India at affordable rates till 2025. It is better deal than Redmi, Vivo, Realme or Oppo. Fingerprint reader is superfast. If you like to watch videos, view pictures or read a book, it is better device than above brands upto price range of Rs.35k.

  Samsung should build some more cell phones like these and variants under 10K as well. This is truly a good cellphone with crisp & clear vivid OLED Display for 14K.SUPER DISPLAY! 5/5Camera performs very well in both daylight and night. You need to be patient and keep in mind you're not holding a 45K plus phone or dslr in your hand for faster shutter speed.Glitches are there ,expecting to be resolved in future updates. The clarity is good even with the selfie camera. Less modes are there , but yeah I use Camera MX so no issues.  4/5Battery life is also upto the mark only disadvantage is the charging time. No fast charging or high watt charger bundled. Not a BiG Problem at all. 4/5Fingerprint is also accurate and works very well. 5/5The UI is typical Samsung UI some bloatware is there , you can uninstall some except the Samsung apps. 4/5Sound is a bit low compared to the MI and REALME , basically ""CHINESE"" devices. However , again not a problem can workout with high volume ringtones for phonecalls. ü§òüèª 3.5/5Body build quality is also good with kind of plastic and metal combination. Colour blue looks premium. Bought tempered glass and back cover together. They arrived early though ü§™. 4/5Headphone jack is also available and the volume rockerz plus power button are on the same side of the phone.Tip- screenshot capture is a bit delay , you need to tap the volume down + power just once and leave , after 2 secs you will be able to see the screenshot capture is processed. There's a visible delay in this. ‚òùÔ∏è Overall for the body options - 4/5Final verdict - In this price range , Samsung is coming back to gain the market and should avail the opportunity (current china ties reservations) to do so by providing more options and more features from 5K till 15K range.Samsung Galaxy M21 - 4.5 / 5.Display is SUPER ! ‚ú®Got it with some discount using Amazon Pay ICICI card and Exchanging Old device. ü§òüèª

  More than after a week of usage, iam extremely disappointed with Samsung M21 phones performance, it is getting hanged, biometric unlocking is not functioning properly... Face recognition is not working since day 1... Apps gets started on their own even with out touching screen at times.... Pathetic phone... Don't go for it... I had purchased the phone on Samsung trust... But it was my mistake.

  Verdict: MONSTER1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.9/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display...Outdoor brightness  is a little issue . Wish it was little brighter3.Design:3/5It has a 6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer...CAN PLAY COD at low or medium settings without any frame drops ( little heating)8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..10.Loud speaker 1.5/5Loudspeaker sound level is very low.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price Its the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer or minimal gaming

  Very bad on the product delivered.Received a defective piece.Hold with me almost a month without no use.my money got stuck with Amazon which did not allowed me to buy another mobile.My EMI started without using the product.Finally got returned after a  month.Never seen this with Amazon since I'm with them for past 10yrs.And moreover,have lost Rs.1500 discount from the banker on the offer.

  Samsung M21 is the exact mobile phone I was looking for. It has amazing battery life with 6000 mah packed inside, which is enough to support full day action without any issue.Battery Score: 5/5Display is as amazing as battery too, with super amoled full hd resolution with 403 ppi density and 420 nits of brightness. However, Gorrila Glass 3 is a little setback. Samsung could have gone for Gorrila Glass 5.Display Score: 4.5/5Camera is decent, producing quality images by rear camera. Front camera could have been better.Camera score: 4/5Performance is fair enough, won't be too good with graphics intensive games like PUBG but won't feel any issue in day to day activities and normal gaming.Performance Score: 4.5/5Some things which are missing: Fast charging, no earphones, loudspeaker sound is not that great.Final Verdict: Very good phone in this price range.

  Review after 15 days:Camera very good.Battery fabulous.Charging 2.5 hrs for full charge so good enough for me once charged can use 2 days with moderate usage and with heavy 1 day 6000mah is no joke.Screen fabulous super amoledRam and storage very good.Processor very good can play almost all high end games for a hr or two with moderate heat. Which is enough for me in a single day and I don't play games continually for 5+ hours on phone.The reason I get this phone for multi tasking and great software experience with best screen available as I'm into huge media consumer. I watch videos for 8 hrs a day on average and other media for 3+ hrs. Which this phone fulfill and give much satisfaction.I got 6gb 128gb black.Worth every penny.... And it's samsung which is better in service also.

  - Good Battery Life- I am not a camera enthusiast, so the camera is good enough for me (M31's camera is better)- Apps work smoothly, no lag. (Mom uses this phone, so no heavy games)- Finger Print sensor is fast & good.- It is more compact compared to M31 (although the dimensions mentioned are same)- Loud Speaker (Mom can no more complaint about not hearing the phone ring)If you are buying it for your parents or a non-gamer, it's literally the best phone.

"
"

  I find the device a better one for its money (128 GB, 6 GB). The battery is good for at least 1.5 days for a lot of regular phone calls and always ON wifi and mobile data. Camera is upto the mark during daytimes. I had no chance of using it in lowlight conditions. Screen is most satisfying aspect of this device. The colours are awesome when viewed in this phone, even photos taken in other mobile look great. Touchscreen is great even after my screenguard in place. There is one option in software for increasing sensitivity of Touchscreen. Software is good to use and smooth with the given storage and RAM. I have not played a single game with this device, so no comment on that. Sound quality is better and loud, even in noisy environment.Overall, for a average person with needs for storage, smooth functioning, calls, wifi, mobile data and watching videos, this device is definitely worth its money.

  second week of the usage and we took this mobile to the service centre as it was not switching on after the repair where some refurbished parts were used in newly purchased mobile, I started facing a new problem, now the phone gets constantly hanged and even sometimes restarts on its ownI have purchase this mobile for my dad and I regret buying this device I read lot of comments and bought this mobile but my personal experience has been very bad I request everyone reading this comment not to buy this product

"
"

  Talking only about cons, other pros are correctly stated in ads.1. camera: If you have proper light then the camera performs outstanding, but if you go in low light conditions things get worse, even my 2-year-old mi note 5 with single-camera works better. Image get blurry and with some auto beautify (which you cant disable) make picture unusable.2. Screen: Although it is super AMOLED but it is not that strong your keys or cards can make scratches.it seems, scratches at level 4 with deeper grooves at level 5!3. and lastly, Battery, 6000Mah? really? even using in normal usage, the battery acts like its normal 3500-4000Mah battery!Thanks for reading this far, the choice is yours, if you are not a gamer and don't like photography that much then go with it, and keep it with a little more care then others!

  Seriously don't buy it, always there is some or other issue, sometimes hanging,  sometimes call disconnects , sometimes voice not coming, touch issues. I was using Nokia 6 (too, old phone) when I was waiting for it, but still it was better then this.I got a replacement for this phone, but the replaced one also having different kond of issues.I was eagerly waiting for this phone in lockdown, but TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.Now putting it for refund.

"
"

  speaker volume cracks when on voice or video calls taken on external speaker, it irritates me , rest front camera is above average. While connected via hotspot to Amazon Fire Tv Stic it always disconnects after some time. this problem is with every device of this model of all my friends too. we need to use other brand phones for such purpose now. thia is highly disgusting thing. also camera app lags a lot.

"
"

  The best feature I found was its display. It's flawless! The interface is also simple and easy to use. The dark mode is amazing and applies to almost every app. Performance wise, it is able to run multiple apps at a time smoothly. The camera quality is better than I expected. The battery lasts two days, because I use it only for 3-4 hours a day. The charging however is slower than my old phone. Despite having a type-C charging port and the claim of super fast charging, I don't find a significant difference between this and other phones. The fingerprint sensor does not work at certain angles and a little slow, but it is accurate. So, to sum it up,Pros:1. Display2. Performance3. Camera4. Battery lifeCons:1. No fast charging, despite the claim2. Fingerprint sensor is slowOverall, it's a good choice and worth a buy.

  After the one month usage.This device sounds good enough for the money.decent battery life some software issues occured need some update to fix it.fingerprint scanner works good and face unlock quite fast than expected.excellent camera at its price range i bought for INR12599 but now it seems nearly 13999. If you are in need of non chinese device go for it.

  **PERFORMANCE** -The processor is good, runs 4K video smoothly. The Super AMOLED display plays a great job in furnishing the right color, contrast, and saturation. You can play normal games but heavy gaming is not possible. Overall Good performance.**CAMERA** -The camera offers slow motion, for as long as u want and ultra-slow motion(for 5 sec at a very high fps ). It has the feature of hyper-lapse as long as u want at x4, x8, x16, x32, and 6000 mAh battery favors long-lasting hyper time-lapse.**BATTERY** - Best battery backup mobile in the present time(2020) at this price tag.  At 20 % battery, you can chill out 2 hours listening to songs, normal youtube video at 720p, and many more. It has 15 watts charging which feels pretty less for a 6000 mAh battery. Takes almost 2 hours and 20 mins to charge ideally, although after charging it's ready for 2 days normal using (video recording for 1 hour, capturing tons of images, 2-hour music, and calling, 5 hours video watch time, and many more. So you can enjoy the battery life.** REVIEWING AFTER 2 MONTHS USE( Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)) **THANK YOU, HOPE IT HELPS.

  Regarding the phone i would say that overall you get a good package from Samsung. This phone is made for people who just want a complete package its not for too techies and game lovers since the processor handles everything fine and smooth except heavy tasks. Phone doesn't have hang problem but yaa there are lags , i faced it while multitasking during video calls . Battery is great you will love it . Charging can be done overnight . Go for this phone if you don't want to buy a chinese smartphone .Lastly i don't relay on tech reviews since this phone is heavily marketed by samsung through tech reviewers .

  My phone just came yesterday. My phone battery is working nice, network is good, camera is nice and interface as well display blow my mind. But just after one day I am listening music in my phone. Then suddenly my volume goes down , i reset my phone then my phone says u are in safe mode. I tried various ways but it is not working I also do factory reset but it is not also worked then now I just replaced my order... I searched in web about this it show that may be the volume down bottom is stucked. And it is a defective piece. I hope my replacement phone will work well.... yes and after replacement the phone came it pretty awesome... as i said earlier....

  Pros ~‚Ä¢ Camera is good. At this price range it's  very good you can't expect much from a  budget phone.  Wide angle photos are good in day light  All around it's a good camera setup.‚Ä¢ Battery backup is best, 6000 mah is the  biggest battery on a phone.‚Ä¢  I'm surprised to see the AMOLED display  at this price and the Samsung's display  quality is world class we all know that.Cons ~‚Ä¢ Phone is quite heavy but you get used to  it.‚Ä¢ it's a plastic body and feels cheap.‚Ä¢ Speakers are not that loud.Although it's a very good phone by Samsung if you are tight on budgetor want a big battery phone go for it.

  Everything is awesome about the phone starting from the amoled display, biometrics, battery life, one ui 2.0, camera performance under bright light. Can't complain too much about the slowish charging speed that it offers considering the price point. One thing that could have been improved is the build quality, this phone doesn't compare with the glass sandwich offerings from pther brands in this price range. And due to the exynos chipset inside, it heats up even with normal usage. So it's not recommended for hardcore gamers. But for normal users, this is the most practical device samsung has to offer in the budget range. Hope this short review helps the future potential buyers of this device.

  Got this 3 days ago, here's my feedback:Amazon sent the mobile packed in a box with shampoo which leaked & spilled over to the mobile box. A BIG BLUNDER by AMAZON Packing Team. I badly needed the phone so started using the phone after Amazon confirmed they will replace the phone if there's an issue. So far phone is working fine, here's the review:Phone is handy not very heavy.User Interface is excellent. Very quick & user friendly.Display is bright enough, real challenge will be in summer though.Fingerprint reader, face scanner are quick.Battery is ok, with heavy use last 1 full day, with average use 1.5 day. But 15 W charger is a letdown which takes 2.5 hours to charge from 0 to 100%, so can charge only at night.Camera is ok, not happy with selfie camera it's like 8MP or 12 MP especially in low light.Rear camera is good but doesn't feel 48 MP as claimed.Expect grainy picture in low light. Day lift pictures are good.Network sometimes loses 4G network & catches E which I never faced in even cheaper phones of Mi.This I noticed couple of times but only for short period. I had read similar reviews before buying this phone, so it's a common issue. Hope future updates may resolve this.Overall satisfied with the phone as of now, since m not a heavy gamer & mostly use for social media & regular work.

  Only camera and display deserves 4 stars and if I compare its battery  with 4000 mA of Redmi note 5 then it appears that its Battery is equivalent to 3800 mA.Fast charging is good but battery also drains out fast.So I think it's Battery deserves 3 stars.And rest function is okay. There is neither heating nor hanging problems.I am posting it after 7 days .

"
"

  Inside the box you get the phone, usb and the fast charger. The back of the phone is plastic easily scratches, loves finger grease, 3 years without smartphones so don't expect me to get into the nitty gritty details but I would say i get all he things a want with this phone a decent camera, huge battery life, screen looks good for the love of God please do yourself a favor and turn  off the vivid color mode, I don't do much gaming on phones honestly prefer to play on pc which i do so no gaming performance analysis sorry :( feels fast tho. The only complaint I have is the Finger print unlock feels a bit weird sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, face unlock haven't tried that why? Spys everywhere.

"
"

  A good one..u will be satisfied with the price still there will be some flaws..apps sometimes keep restarting(not alwayd still).fingerprint sensor is fyn but face unlock does not work always as expected but works fyn in good lighting conditions...camera is also grt in daylight..but night mode doesnt deliver much...The UI is smooth and hence gives a fluid perfomance.Display is also great for the price.So you wont regret buying this still consider some realme phones too before buying this....

"

  I am not a technical expert but can give review in layman terms which could be helpful. The camera is really good. Quality of picture is amazing.It claims to have a fast charging but I m disappointed with the time it takes to charge. It just increases 6% if I m reading a book while its charging. I have definitely seen fast charging. The screen size is bit small to my liking.. i have seen bigger screens in lower price range.Next is software.. it linked to mh old phone to download ghe apps and I did not had to do any struggle but alas even after 12 hours it was stuck ag 3% download. So I jad yo stop that and do manual downloads which tool half an hour only.Color of the phone is good,can't complain

"
"

  After 2 months of use, I am satisfied with this phone. display and camera are good in this price range. Battery Life is quite good but don't expect too much from 6000mah.  Phone heats while playing games like pubg but its ok. speaker is good.Disappointed with fingerprint sensor, because most of the time it says the sensor is dirty and i have to use pattern to unlock which is frustrating. I don't know this problem is with other phones also or not.  Well, the most important thing is the other options available, redmi 6 pro is one of them but that will also have some drawbacks. So overall its good in the price range. U should buy this.

"
"

  It's a great phone for normal usage, amazing battery life, easily lasts for one and half days atleast, you can't kill it in a day.Display Quality is really nice, colours and contrast do pop up ani it's Samsung Amoled, the best in the market.Camera quality is also good considering the price point, no issues with image processing, it's good.The security system on this phone is fasttt, the fingerprint reader is really really efficient and the best part is, face unlock works even in darkness, the lock screen gets brighter and recognizes your face. It's really really nice.

  Samsung Galaxy m21:Is a very good budget smartphone.It narly can beat mi A3 and realme 5.Good thing about Samsung galaxy m21 it has a huge 6000mAh battery and a 48 MP triple camera set and an amoled display.Bad thing Is it has polycarbonate body not so premium feel, one need a premium case to protect it and look as well, wifi connectivity is not so strong, but in this budget we can ignore it.Looks: a large display amoled screen phone, amazing experience for video and play not so heavy games. Gorilla Glass 3 protection, Samsung can provide gorilla glass 5, v shaped notch better if it has punch hole. Plastic body, but easy to hold. Under 13000 we can ignore these.Camera:A super camera setup under this price range. Samsung improves it's dynamic range and Bokeh effect, so one can easily pick a DSLR style photo with it. 48+5+5 composition really great.Performance: It has its own samsung Exynos 9611 processor which is good for daily use and not upto for ultra graphics game. One can easily play PUBG, COD, afterlife or fortnite. It's better we can expect 9811 in 2020.Battery:A remarkable backup of almost 10 hrs if heavy games or vdo played or around 20 hrs for moderate net use. It's been better if therevis fast charger of 20watt or more is available.Conclusion part: I have ordered it for my father and he has fallen love with this phone.Budget: 12699.00One can get 48 MP triple camera, 6000 mAh battery and sAmoled display.. if your budget is around Rs 12000 or Rs 15000 can go for this mobile wothout as it also non Chinese brand.Best competetor: redmi note 9pro max and realme narzo 10If you like my review kindly hit helpful.RegardsManas, Guwahati, Assam

  I m writing review after 4 day uSe of this phone, Everything is amazing in this mobile phone of M21. It's suitable for professional use. Good look, design . Main teachers in build and installed are : good hands free talks, vice recording, fine operation, good quality camera , powerful battery . No heating problem reported. One should buy this make in India product.

"
"

  In this range M21 is the best phone to purchase as it gives a long battery life with fast charging supported and with 48MP camera and a lot more.Moreover the phone is not dedicated for gaming purpose but you can play any high graphic game in it without lagging or any graphical issues.And the last but not least the size of the screen is cherry on the cake.

"
"

  When you make up your mind to go for the most renowned brand at double the cost of normal brands , it ditches and disappoints you . In 2 months the set is dead . I cant believe this . Amazon too should get in touch with SAMSUNG . I thought at Amazon and with Samsung such fragility of customer satisfaction is shocking  . Have given it in the service center lets see hope I get a replacement . Will surely get back for further review after the issue is sorted out

"
"

  Well There is one thing i must point out...network reception is very bad like you are using a phone for  15 min then out of which netwrk will be gone 2-3 times for a min ......i dn know what is happening....but it didnot happend with me with ny previous fone...my sim sim is airtel....i live in a city then why is that happening...if there is already a netwrk issue in your place then do not try this phone i advice...apart from this......if you are not a pubg gamer then it is the best suited phone for you...you can still play pubg for half n hr but after that it will hang like hell....best camera best batery best user interface....samsung security....What more...its perfect for you if u r not a pubg gamer

  I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHERS THINKS ABOUT THIS MOBILE , THIS IS MY HONEST REVIEWI am writing my review after using it for few days,1. obviously its a monster. very good performance.2. Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3. battery usage was so good. good battery life  Two day battery standby was good.  only im facing baterry discharging percentage dropping issue on overnight.  No fast charging.. 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone  Heats when i charge.4. performance is good too for day to day usage.  I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a  hardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative  since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming.  For casual gamers it will do the job well.5. Camera, both front and back is pretty good.6. no additional accessories, earphones, screenguard, backcover.it is the best phone under 15k.Go for it.

"
"

  A beautiful body, No glass back which is fine for the price.Mind blowing gestures (One hand mode, Notification panel slide in the sensor) which makes the use even more easy.Fast fingerprint reader and Solid battery life, fast charging makes it even more easier.The camera quality could be better, the photos lack a crisp but it's not that problematic.Comes with a headphone Jack which is God sent and the speakers are good and loud but will know after a year of use.A slim phone but a little heavy, the 6000 mah explains that but could have done better.A good price and product for a flagship brand.

  I am an avid samsung fan. My last 2 phones have all been samsung. And i knew samsung will be the chosen one for me. Is it because of the huge brand name? No. Is it because its the best in technological quality? Not entirely. Is it because i hate eating apples? Oh no no fruits are healthy but I'm not a fan of eating iphone, if thats what you mean. Is it because its from korea and I'm a kpop fan? Lmao you wish....I choose samsung because of its consistent and convenient customer care service. The problems with phones will not be at the beginning when you start thumbing and glaring at it. Rather it will be when it starts emitting problems and you're too impatient to leave it at a service store for 5-7 days, jobless and tech-bereft at home. So yes, thats why i chose to get a samsung phone. Not because its the best of the best of the best in the whole wide world (There are much more better and more expensive phones within the samsung world itself...duhh). But because their customer service is better than others and is available anywhere conveniently.But i do like the upgrade from 3500 to 6000 mah. And from 3/36 gb to 6/128gb memory( i used j6 for 2 years) I'm a basic user. I browse, type, read....sometimes play ML. So M21 at 15k is a good phone for me. And im glad i waited for a phone like this at the range i bought. So here's to my new journey with my new phone for another 2 years.

"

  I want to explain to you about Samsung M21 mobile phone.  When I wanted to buy this phone, I searched all the online websites and compared it with other phones.  If you want you can also find out about it on YouTube.  After seeing it all I thought a bit about the rate.  Surprised to be given so many features on such a low budget.  You can also check the rate on the online website if you want, Amazon is offering it at a very low price If you want you can also compare the rate on mysmartprice but also on mobiles9.com.  There is a difference of up to about 4,000.  4gb ram 14000 6gb ram 16000.  If you pay for the phone, everything is fine. The camera, battery, display and Samsung brand are compatible. Now arrived your redmi, realme Oppo,  Vivo, I would recommend buying this phone above all else.  That too through the Amazon app.

"
"

  This phone is awesome. It is one of the best smartphone in 14000 Rs. The battery is really a monster.Pros-A realü§© Monster battery.Big 6 inch screen.Amazingü§© camera.And what about Samsung UI, love it.In normal use - no lag at allAnd love the front notch.Lighting fast fingerprint sensor.No lag in everyday gaming, even in PuBg(classics)Cons-This phone is not meant for HEAVY ghraphics gaming.If you think that you are pro in PUBG and will play custom and tournaments, then please don't take this phone. It lags when there is more enemies or an in intensive fights (but yeh, if you play low graphic games this will never be any issue).And face unlock takes nearly 2 seconds to open.And rest is fun,I saw videos on YT that it take more than 3 hrs to charge from 0 to 100, but I tried the same but charged fully in 2hrs 35 min.I played PuBg for nearly 6 hrs, 30 min with full battery.This phone is not for hardcore gamers.If you want this phone for everyday then go for it.I think that you can use this phone for nearly 3 years without any issue or hang.

"
"

  I'm writing this review based on my experience  with my Samsung phone and not necessarily this particular phone. The design and material in most of phones below 25k are more or less. Some higher priced phones are even worse.The phone is made of very flimsy components which would gives fault much earlier, within few months. There will not be any support or warranty. Any fault, you are on your own.My phone is lying with Service Center for more than a month, and they insist I pay money for the repair.Samsung is selling brand names and cheating Indian customers. This would be my last Samsung phone.

"
"

  Pros:-The best mobile under 20K. sAMOLED FHD 6.4' screen+6000mAH big battery with great backup+15 Watt Type C fast charger. Display is very very brigh & awsone. 48MP back camera take photos like 64 MP. Front Camera 20MP, clarity & quality is the best in class.Cons:-Due to big capacity of battery it takes 3+ hours to get full charge, but as it gives great back up need not to plug frequently for charging. I am not a gamer but heavy cosumer of multi media. For me it gives 10-11 hrs of backup, hence only night charge is sufficient to use full day. 15Watt type C charger is actually performeds like more than its capacity. 4/64 Model is decent choice. RAM & Storage type is excellent.All sensors are available with fast response.What can be expected more than this superb features @‚Çπ12599 (My price) with the most trusted & respected Brand all over the world üåé. Really SAMSUNG'S standard remains unmatched.

  I have used this for around a month and now I think I can write a reviewSo please read it till end. GENUINE REVIEWFor the first two weeks the battery life was extraordinary. Yes you heard it right as I am a very hard core  gamer and I play 3h of pubg daily and I was still able to use it for more than one day  It was more than expected. And 15w charging was also enough Pubg was running very smooth with extreme frame rate but after that there was a slight decline in the battery life and I think that was due to installation of new applicationsTher was no problem in day to activities and in gaming tooSamsung provides very nice and good servicesNow time for camraThe last device I was using for more than one year was Redmi note 7 proYes it is not a gaming phone but still I used itNow on comparison btw both of the cameras their was a tie as some pictures of 7 pro were better than m21 and vica versa.So its main highlight  the super AMOLED screen make him  the winner of all phones of his price rangeSo I by heart recommend this phone if have this much budget and it is better than poco m2 pro

  I was using one plus earlier. After I lost that I bought this one for standby. I took this for battery and display. The review is based on what I feel after using for few days.Pros:1. With a such big battery it is still very handy and comfortable to use.2. Display is really very vibrant. I use high brightness and in this at 40% only I am happy.3. It is good in speed comparing to the price range.Cons:1. Heating problem from start. Even on normal use. Felt this after so many years.2. Battery does not comprehend with its specs. It looks like 4000+ mah one.3. On the top the battery takes a mammoth of time to get charged. So gaming people might feel uncomfortable.4. Build quality is not good. Sometimes some small addition can make wonders with out extra cost. Back is finger and scratch caller.Overall it is a good product in the price range. I didnt gave any camera review as I am not a professional and the comparison is with my other mobiles which are way above in price and quality.

  48mp camera awesome and Night mode better photo. 6000 mah battery standby two days without gaming. Gaming performance is just ok, not for gamers this phone. Super Amoled display stunning. Slowmo and super slowmo excited. Front 20mp camera great. Charging time take so much like 2 hrs 20 mins in fast charging. Sometimes display as heated while playing games or movie.

"
"

  My review is for an average user (student but not a gamer).Back Camera - 48Mp - picture gets blurred on zoom in so average camera but really like the wide field of view option. seen that for the 1st time. covers approx half of the room in wide field of view option.Front camera - satisfied(very good)Battery - easily last more than 24 hours with constant usage so satisfiedLook - back panel not so lavish but neither do I (i always use a back cover). so dosent matter. from front looks royal large screen.Display - simply amazing(believe me)Internal storage - upto 100gb will be available. 20 will be used by basic applications.comes with memory card slot + 2 4G sim slotdoes it get hot while calling for long duration (included because I had that doubt before buying) - but no it doesn't.Moved after a long time from redmi's and realme's to Samsung, has really gained back the confidence in Samsung

"
"

  Its been almost one and a half month since i am using this phone. And i find this phone really nice when it comes to the favt that at which price you are getting this phone. So in that area its a gr8 deal. Its same as M30s. . I just find the camera of this phone not up to mark. I personally m not satisfied to a gr8 extent with the camera.i mean its not that bad but its not wow as well.. Its pretty good. But not Wow. Rest of the features are good. Battery life is also good . But i think with 6000mah of battery the charger is not compatible. Its olny 15w and takes time to charge. So my verdict is that is a gr8 deal. You wont be dissatified after buying it.

"
"

  Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good.PROS:CAMERA - 4/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 5/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5CONSNO HeadsetCamera image clarity could have been made better. I could see more noises/grains.Overall: 4.5/5 Samsung M21 proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it

  Within 4 months from date of purchasing ( date of Order- 24-05-2020 and date of delivery-28-05-2020) display of mobile ( Samsung Galaxy M21) damaged, phone was properly working in night  and even in morning but when we put the mobile phone on charging in morning and after 10 minutes when we went to see the charging percentage ( How much charged) I found the dark spot at corner of Mobile Phone and blinking on screen and touch function was also not properly working.After that we contacted Customer care Executive of Samsung Phone they advised us to visit Samsung Service centre as your phone is in warranty period so your problem will be solved free of cost and we visited the Samsung Authorised Service Centre (J.M.V. Enterprises, address : Dev Complex 1st floor, Opp. Roop Garden  at Bahadurgarh Service Centre staff explained us that Mobile Phone has fallen or Pressed and you will have to deposit the phone and the amount of display will be reduced and balance will be returned to you as coupon and it will take at least 1 month we don't have spare part required for repairing of  this phone in spite of telling all the things honestly that neither the phone fallen nor pressed and the problem only started after putting the mobile on charging they were rigid to not hear us and once again it is repeated that the fact is neither phone has fallen nor  pressed  the problem started only after putting the Mobile on charging. We have no option as they are not hearing us . We feel that it was totally loss of Peace of mind , loss of money and loss of time. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE OF SAMSUNG GALAXY M21 AND SAMSUNG MOBILE PHONE (Handset)  CUSTOMER SERVICES.  GOD KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED BUT THE MOBILE PHONE WAS IN GOOD CONDITION BEFORE PUTTING IT ON CHARGING.( THERE IS NO SCRATCH OR MARK ON MOBILE PHONE). THANKS.

  Rejected Chinese Phones and gone for a Samsung phone expecting a good hardware performance (User Interface of Samsung always lags behind the same of other phones of its range). Expected its robust hardware will serve me for at least next 3-4 years.There is no outstanding feature that helps it stand out of other phones in its price range. Even there are many phones (but Chinese, of course) priced Rs. 2-3000/- below M21, with far better performance. My Realme1 was far better than this M21 in all respect.1. With 6000 mAh battery, standby time is supperb, as long as you are NOT using the phone. The moment the display is ON, you can literally see the battery percentage dropping % by %. At night, it loses 10% charge in 8 absolutely unused hours.Charging takes a whopping 4 hrs from 30 to 100%.2. Heats up a lot during charging.3. User interface and software features are quite poor as compared to today's competitors like Realme, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo etc. User interface is sluggish, and hangs at least twice a day, for a few seconds.4. Mobile signal reception too poor. The 4G of my Airtel frequently drops to 2G. For past several years, I faced no signal issue at my home with any of my my other phones. This same SIM was working perfectly with my Realme1.5. During calls to other network, internet gets disconnected.6. Several apps, running smoothly earlier on my Realme1 struggles in M21.7. Camera - Video resolution below 720x1280 not available.8. Dark mode is unstable. And often doesn't work on all apps.9. During call, Earpiece area becomes extremely hot.With the replacement date already over, I will now have to find tips & tricks to reduce its performance to have a minimum battery life.Disappointed !!!

  It is a good phone for the price point. But I have a few complaints.First to give context I migrated from Redmi 3S Prime. Thus accustomed to MIUI and version last used was MIUI 11.The complaints I have are on the Samsung One UI which the developers can give a little more thought on.1. No notification led. They could have used the camera notch as a led indicator.2. Screen doesn't wake up for third party notification like WhatsApp which is a real bummer.3. They have used a trimmed down version of One UI for Galaxy M devices so this phone doesn't have apps like Samsung secure folder and which can be used to hide folders, lock apps. But this never happens with MIUI no matter the price of the phone. Even you cannot install Secure folder from the app store.

  after usage 0f 43 days ,i am writing this reviewmobile is awesome, 48 Mpa cam,wonderful, front cam 20 mp most of you like it,fingerprint sensor is fast. battery is 6000 mah but we feel like it as 4500 mah, the UI ,and speed of system is good . but the negatives are these are not coming with IR, which we cannot control our tv,a.cmain drawback , even though it is 14000 rs, it must be added.i only purchased make in India product only, even though i am having other options with a price less than 2000rs(12000rs).one more thing samsung brand.at least u can use 3 years.all are fine,.. Sound is awesome with dolby dual speakers.one more negative is micro phone problem,if you are talking closely to your mouth its ok otherwise its horrible.even talking on loudspeaker mode is not suitable because of sound clarity to other person ...over all mobile is fine and good. IR BLast need to be included in phone.

  I selected Galaxy M21 as per my requirement features in mobile. This model do my daily task very easily and fast, the camera result is as good as always.6000MAH battery give facility to full day active in mobile without worry in traveling which look like a mini power bank.The finger print sensor are full of responsive than my old mobile.I always like superAmoled display and this mobile have this.There are others extra features like face unlock, dark mode by schedule, Dolby sounds, Always on display, voice typing supported, etc are atrack me to buy this phone with extra cash back of Rs.1500 on HDFC Card, so this all features comes with economic price, Thanks to AMAZON & SAMSUNG.

  The phone's specifications are good, but the major issue is the battery. It heats up to such an extent that it is difficult to hold the phone. This happens quite often, while you watch videos on YouTube/ Prime video or just play a game. Further the battery drains very fast. From 100 to 60 in just an hour.

  ¬†Samsung has done a great job in terms of design and built qaulity phone is awesome1.it has a great battery life,if you are buying it for gaming please note that it gives you a great battery backup although do not that it heats up quickly while gaming for 1 hour.2.fingerprint reader is quick,it has face unlock option but it not worth using everytime as sometimes it could not recognise you it highly depends on the place you are in , the ambient light and all.3.sound is awesome,it has a single speaker though it gives a good sound,but the headphone jack is present at the side of your charging jack,which if you are a gamer might annoy you.do note that it has adolby atmos feature.and dolby is known for its great sound quality.you may get a good surround sound experience if tou are using a good headphone.4.camera quality is good,not very great it has triple camera setup in the rear due to which you can capture a wide frame.it has single camera on front end it is equally good.5.the type of screen is something which you may not get with many higg priced smartphones,yes it has super amoled display and samsing produces some of the high quality displays,clearly if you want to watch movies this phone is just for you,it gives you a great combination of dolby atmos sound and super amoled display.

  Value for money, Best Display in 20k segment,  you cannot get this display quality in Other brands and Camera is Another plus, pictures are Vivid and 4k video colours are good where as in other brands 4k video turns out in red colour and remember to turn off notifications from galaxy store and turn promotions so you won't get unnecessary push notifications and turn on reduce animations for speeding up UI

  Worst mobile believe me don't buy Samsung their screen is too delicate. it get break just with a slight drop from my pocket length. I shifted to other companies in 2017 from Samsung due to same Samsung issue bit this time gave it another chance due to 6000 Mah battery. But I'm regretting now. They are advertising it with gorilla glass but they are fooling people. My old motorola mobile is even better using that from last two years dropped it multiple times. But it's working great till now. Now they are asking for 5500 for repairing it.Cons-Too delicate screenInternet not works on 4G even in delhiSlow motion camera not works smoothlyToo thick and bulky phoneCamera quality is not good, it is same aschinese brand phoneFingerprint reader does not works if you are outside and your hands are little bit dirtyBattery life is equal to 5000 mah of Motorola phone.

  The product is good and works for me.Just the thing is regarding ethics. I bought this phone in Amazon prime day sale where 10% of discount was promised on Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit Card in two slots. 5% instant discount and 5% cashback. It was not mentioned anywhere that the offer will not be applicable on No Cost EMI for the same card. If that would have mentioned at the time of payment, I would have bought the product with full amount instead of EMI. When talked with customer care, first they said they'll resolve the problem in 48 hours. Since it was not resolved in 48 hours, I called again to check. This time they said that the payment method was not eligible for offer and they can not do anything about it since it's a mobile phone and can be returned only if any damage or defect is there. I'm using Amazon for more than 5 years now and being prime member I did not expect this kind of misleading.

  Just within a month if it‚Äôs purchase, the screen does not work properly. The touch screen is very very faulty. I have restarted my phone like 100 times by now but to no use. It‚Äôs like the touch doesn‚Äôt work only. Imagine a Samsung product being so faulty, that too within a month of purchase. I am totally taken aback. I think it‚Äôs a fake product. Don‚Äôt know what exactly the issue is. And now during this pandemic where do I go to fix it. Can somebody suggest sth? Is there an option of exchange ?

  So I bought this for my dad and was bit apprehensive about the phone before I bought it. My dad wanted to have a phone which is easy to use and has good battery backup. He gone through saveral phones on Amazon but he was not convinced by other brands. He selected this and asked me to make sure this is a good phone. I order this and am very glad that it turned out to be a great phone! (Otherwise I have been dead lol) He is very happy with the performance, easy UI, great battery backup and nice camera. Now my mom, my dad and myself, all use Samsung mobile.  I'll recommend this phone as an excellent budget phone packed with great features!

  In Samsung family there is no technology update... It's the only family of old generation.. M21 is most expected one but it's not up to the benchmark mobile... Most worst thing is charging it's taking around 3hous to full charge... Background application and battery usage is most dissatisfaction of this mobile... Not suitable for long drive ones... Discharging is very fast and SAMSUNG needs to look into this to resolve... Once upon a time it's trending brand now slowly it's also becoming like NOKIA.. style one... Better to focus on performance and charging items on this brand... Any model same processors and if it mentions 6000mAh also it's not perform like 3500amh Galaxy Grand mobile... There are no changes from Galaxy Grand to Galaxy M21, 51.... Come out from bad look forward new technology updates to stand up in the market orelse it will become another NOKIA... keep on eye to grow up....!!!

  Best ever Samsung I am using in my life(as per the price to ratio)...Not going to talk about the Display cause everyone knows that the Display is great...But the other important aspects which are always forgotten by the reviewers to tell, I am sharing with you now...1st of all network reception (call+internet) is better than any SD665 or SD 675 powered phone( I can tell this because I did use both SOCs in different phones by myself).2nd multitasking is awesome...no lag in day 2 day life usage and light gaming(But not good for highend gamers)...3rd point will be the Camera which are awesome in this price point...4th point will be the UFS 2.1 storage in this price which is awesome...The only problem is the Charging time which is near to 2.5 hrs( 15watt charger/6000mah cell)Build metirial is polycarbonet but if u buy the black verient u will never complain...yes u have to maintain the phone a little bit which is acceptable..Lastly I can say one thing...this phone is less premium but more Functional...Fully Functional... I want that because I don't like to buy products which are unnecessarily expensive(Even Galaxy A series)... [One should buy Galaxy M21 over M31 if he/she satisfied with 48mp rear cam. I think it's more than enough]

  Finally a phone from Samsung which can be bought and tough competition for other chinese players like xiaomi and realme under 15000.... An ad free edperience with lots of customisation..... Have used m30s also. Now samsung has improved much and can be recommended to others. Seems like Samsung will soon come at no. 1 spot if it works the same way its going now. Have also used s10+ but this phone has the best value for money. Just before it i was using Mi A3 and can surely agree to the fact that Samsung makes the best displays in the industry. There are some cons also but seeming the price and samsung brand value it shadows all the cons. I am not a gamer and use the phone for day to day tasks and the chipset is working fine. Definitely the chipset is better than sd 665 as its faster than Mi A3. I have recommended at least 5 M21 to my family members after the data privacy issue and all are fully satisfied with it.

  The phone is pretty good. It's super light to hold, gives the feel of phones that were available 2-3 years back. The battery is a monster, lasts almost 2 days but takes 2 hours to charge completely. The screen is awesome, there is no lag of any kind, the camera is not great though. I haven't had any heating issues, and the call quality is pretty good too. Works for me, non of that gimmicky Chinese bs, bang for the buck of you ask me.

  The fingerprint is a bit flimsy but works fine. The phone stutters with the 4 gb ram. It gets warm on the upper part of the screen. Not for power users. Suitable for parents with that massive battery. Microphone quality is good for calls. Samsung should better their build quality to compete with their Chinese counterparts. The samusung UI has nice quirks and features. The amoled panels outshines.

  Writing this review after 2 months of usage.Camera quality of redmi phones at this range is at par but its camera is also good.the back camera is pretty good, the front selfie camera has no flash and also a lil dull when its dark but otherwise its good.Finger print sensor is quick.Battery is humungous..typically lasts about 1.5-2 days with full charging. Also full charging requires about 2 hours or lessI am not a vivid mobile game player but still i can assure you with 4gb mobile games are an easy task but cant say anything about pubg players.screen display is also good. For 14k other phones offer much better camera quality but overall got a decent phone at this range. also purchased this phone because of ongoing anti chinese sentiment

  Everything was fine but after one month touch screen got dead. Gave it to the store then got it after 1 month. Now it is working fine I don't know why Samsung's product always has a problem nearly 1 month after buying. Is Samsung can resolve this then Samsung is best product for Indian considering all geopolitical issues of India.

  I am writing this review after 15 days of usage..Pros -1.Exellent Display quality.As it is Samoled display it is very good for videos and HQ images.2.Battery Life is far enough as 15w fast charging is not enough it takes approx 2.5 to 3 hours to complete charge the device.But it gives very good battery backup.3.Processor is overall good for daily normal usage4.Sound Quality is decent but quality increase as we shift to Dolby Atmos sound.Cons -1.I don't use Camera so much but it gives little less detail images.2.Processor is not good for heavy gaming like Pubg or other big games.It got lagged even on medium setting.Overall I rate this phone 4.5 out of 5.There are some little things they improve but if you are not a heavy user than it is very good phone for you.Nice battery backup superb display..

  I bought this for my dad.1. Great display2. Rear finger print sensor (I prefer this compared to in display ones)3. Samsung UI has some decent useful features,4. I wasn't looking for great camera, the selfie camera is just bad with all beautification going on (even if turned off), the rear cameras looks ok.5. With 6000 mah battery, the phone doesn't feel bulky and the weight is around 188g, which is good for older people.

"

  The phone is having performance issues; such as heat up issue, Voice suppress issue. So I complained several times to Amazon customer care. Each time they just ran few diagnostics online through their Blanco app and said that phone is not having any issue. However we can feel that the phone is actually getting heat up and having voice suppression issue. They are not ready to send a technician also to check the phone. The product has 7 days replacement policy. Still they are not ready to replace the phone.

  This phone is best for the display and the battery life. Streaming movies on the phone is amazing. Thanks to Widevine u can stream in full HD. Dolby Atmos is a gimmick. Better to download the app Wavelet which is the best sound equalizer and use it along with Atmos.The fingerprint reader becomes unresponsive at times since it is easily smudgy. Using a back case is a must.The camera captures really good colours and the lighting is very good but the only drawback is that in focus mode the blurring around the edges of smaller objects tends to be messy but of course the blur is adjustable even after the picture has been clicked.Coming to the call quality sometimes it is fine and sometimes the person on the other end cannot hear me properly. The call quality is just average. Samsung Should have improved this.

  The best Product with most essential have to features smart phone and in budget..Best...1. Wide angle photography with best clarity.2. Long lasting  battery back up.3.Slim and handy design.4.Speedy processor.5.HD display with best display and colour experience as u can see in attached images.6.Feel of luxury smartphone due todimensions,design and quality of material and hardware.7.Ample space and RAM in this price tag in branded phone name tag.Scope in improvement.1.If in box transparent coveris  added then it will be the best dial..As for new phone to search that in market with best material is difficult.2.Some glossy /shiny colour combinations will attract youth more.3.Crome update notification is consistent though tried to update...It's not getting updated through playstore...4. Software update notification is also always getting poped up even after updating only showing it's updated.Thank you

  Don‚Äôt buy Samsung m series. Very poor quality than cheaper china phones. Not even 3 months, now battery not charging. Many people have this mentioned about this in Samsung official website. I regret, I didn‚Äôt read those reviews before buying. Now phone is totally dead. Very disappointed with Samsung.

  Hello FriendsI am using samsung phones for last 5 years and I dont beleive in spending much on phones and This time I bought M21 for my mother. I must say its just sensational. Fingerprint sensor is amazing given in the backside.Camera quality is great in this prize range.Battery is superb as it is taking 6000 mah battery in it. My mother doesnt need to charge for 2 days. Sometimes she forgets where the charger is... Jokes ApartBut winding up all i am happy with the phone I purchased for my Mom at 13999/-

  Hi team, since the phone delivered was non functional and caused inconvenience. Please compensate atleast by providing Samsung headphone. This was very frustrating experience ever. Also, am facing issues with the phone gallery as not all the media (photos) from whatsapp is getting saved to gallery as per settings. Please help or give options to exchange this product with a new one.

  Product is v good for the price compared to other mobiles of similar range.Battery charging is normal and not Fast charging. It requires more than 135 to 150 minutes to get it charged fully.Camara is good for the range.Functions of key board touch is good.All other functioning are good in settings.To improve the functioning it is suggested the following.1. To provide a class earphone to the buyers to have similar sound effect. ( in the absence of earphone individual buyer use different different earphone and gets hence sound effect range differs. Cheaper quality earphone not only damage sound effect but also damage earphone pin hole.2. Company to provide mobile cover with its Brand image emborsed (clearly visible from distance) so that Samsung identity can be improved. Company spends huge amount on advertising.  Instead provide a better quality cover with Brand name for wider publicity. Take for example iPhone.Moreover sidekey functions touchable sensitiveness differs from one another due to usage of low quality back case.

  Was in Delima between Redmi Note 8 4GB & M21. Since I have Note 8 in the family already. All redmi/ Mi phones become expensive by 2-3k due to change in GST. My last phone broke in lockdown & was in the market to buy new. I saw M21 & compared it with Redmi note 8. Almost the same price point but Samsung got a new processor. Frankly speaking, coming from stock Android, I don't like MI user interface, too much Chinese & customized. Samsung has a clean UI with minimal bloatware. And has 6000mah battery. So I purchased on Amazon. I thank Amazon for reducing delivery time to ease as Mobiles are a necessity. Good phone under 15k if you don't want Chinese/ complicated UI. Well, don't expect camera quality to be so high. But it's good for general use.ProsGreat battery (6000mah)Amoled screenNew processorWide-angle mode in-camera ( Average result)Great price ( @ 12700/- when I purchased)Polycarbonate body ( better than glass back as less wear & tear more rugged)ConsRam management ( too much ram consumption with just 4-5 external apps installed). No game installed yet.Battery optimization is poor (with just 2 calls in a day, 3 hrs screen on time, some background apps) EOD battery 40% left.Screen is big to handle with 1 hand & super expensive if broke (around 9k)Average camera. ( Too soft skin, more of digital filter)Overall best phone under 15K if you can survive with pros more than cons.

"

  I regret buying this phone.The phone lags a lot, too slow.Camera results is just on paper. In this price range you would get better phone with better camera quality.It comes with some unnecessary apps and some of the app you can't remove from the phone  ie Facebook and NetflixIt doesn't offer dual app settings for all the apps like other phones.It doesn't have any inbuilt app lock functionality.Overall, if you are okay with above cons and have spare money to waste then definitely go for this one.

  Bought Samsung M21 on July 10, 2020.Worked very well and was happy using it until started having issues with galaxy M21.Very low sound during phone calls. Samsung advised me to take the phone to the service centre after all the troubleshooting didn't help.Not very odd to have an issue with an electronic device but it is very frustrating to see this in a brand new phone. And certainly, it is not an enjoyable experience to take a brand new phone to the service centre 20 km away.Cant return as the return window is closed as well.Hope Samsung work on their quality controls.Not Happy!!!

  #####First don't believe youtube reviewers..####This phone can't even do simple task (not gaming) like opening apps it lags like a 2years old smartphone.The camera is useless indoors but its pretty good outdoors when lighting is perfect. Nightmode is not great but justifiable.Its has one ui core not One UI as other S'phones.I hate it, maybe because i was a stock android user.Its takes good time to charge...build quality is below average.I comparing m21 with my brother's redmi note 8 (‚Çπ10k) it click far better picture indoors, so to those idiots who says buy samsung for good camera..fek UFinal verdict: I owned samsung E7 5years ago...my first phone was samsung ace to be frank this phone's camera is somewhere between those two phones... E7 had much better build quality than this phone..Just disappointed.They have an app called galaxy store which is just as getapps in miui without seksi üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è ads.... randomly downloading rummy apps..üòë

  Product is really nice.  Everything fine.  But when I opened my box I found the plastic which was used to wrapped screen it was dusty and had sand particles.  Seems someone returned the phone and same phone was sent after little tochup but may be plastic attract dust so it was not gone.  Never seen dust and sand particles inside any box of brand new phone.I have not asked for return or replace because I don't had any spare phone to use for otherwise I would have immediately asked to return or replce.But product is perfect to use.  NO ISSUES.  BATTERY AND CHARGER WORKING FINE.

  very unhappy, Amazon doesn't even allow me to write the actual problem I faced with this purchase (product is very good, service from Amazon is not). Thanks to your policies...

"
"

  Great for this price range. Android 10 with UI 2.0 makes it even better. Battery lasts about 2 days on normal uses(web browsing, youtube, social media, etc). But not for heavy use like intense gaming or opening heavy apps all at once. Normally, only 1.5 GB ram is available out of 4 GB (excluding reserved 400 - 500 MB ram).

"
"

  I have been using this product for past 1 month.pros1) Battery backup :- With a massive 6000 mah battery  its a killer. Lasts for atleast 1 day with normal usage.2) Camera :- You get the real colors in the image which is good. The Camera quality is nice.3) SAR  value:- The radiation emitted by this phone is quite low4) Display:- With super amoled display and resolution of 2300*1080 pixels it gives a very clear display. Moreover with blue light filter it is easy on eyes.5) Data Connection :- It has Samsung ultra data saving mode with end to end Encryption. It makes you safe while surfing web or online transactions.Cons :-1)Price :- Its priced I guess 1000-2000 rupees higher than its competitor like Realme n Redmi.PS:- Go for it.

"
"

  I will recommend this phone for those who want a decet phone for daily use, camera is very good, display is better than anything in this price segment.Battery last for two days for normal uses, thanks to its 10 nm processor. Charging time is not that great as I was expecting but if you consider 6000 mah battery and 15 watt charger it's ok. Here Samsung would have added at least 20 watt charger.Over all performance is very good and super amoled display is a bonus.If you are not a heavy gamer you can go with it without any thought.

"
"

  Overall this phone is good but it has some issue with the volume. If you are in WhatsApp video chat with someone and at the same time a voice call came to your phone but you disconnected the voice call the immediately the sound of video call reduced to almost negligible and cant be increased  All have to do is to disconnect the call and call back again.

  1. AMOLED display had this Yellowish tint (Which is common for any AMOLED Display so at this Price we can't expect much) but Solved it using Screen Balance App by Adjusting the White Balance.2. NETFLIX was Preinstalled and after updating it via Play Store had terrible visuals like it was a Very Poor 480p Streaming, but got resolved when updated it using the Galaxy Store.3. Perfectly Fine for Casual Offline Games.4. Quite Good Camera for Daylight.5. Battery seems to be Good Enough (Snapdragon:5000Mah = Exynos:6000Mah)

"
"

  The phone stands true to its word. You cannot expect the performance it gives in price range of 13k. Camera quality is excellent at 48MP. Fingerprint reader is fast and it also has face unlock which works even in low light. And believe me these are perfect value for money. Battery last more than 1.5 days with moderate usage. The sAMOLED screen is excellent with accurate colors and a very smooth touch. It has many useful features one cannot count.I have both m31 and m21 at home. I ordered one phone before lockdown in march and impressed by the performance i ordered second phone now. I personally feel it better than any other phone in this price segment.

"
"

  The phone is just awesome. Fingerprint scanner is fast and smooth. The face unlock is also very fast. To be honest i rarely use my fingerprint reader.As you can see in the image, the camera quality of the phone is amazing. It give the perfect shot with different options. The only difference between m21 and m31 is of camera but it still gives a perfect experience to you. You also have an option for clicking the image of food.Battery life is good if you are not overusing the phone. It easily lasts more than a day.The best feature is super amoled display. The samsung UI is just a smooth experience.

"
"

  I have been using M21 for over a week and honestly it was the best decision !Pros :Best Battery life , Camera quality ,Awesome Super Amoled Display ,Charging is quite fast even though it has15W fast charging.Cons :Not the best Face Unlock in this price.Honestly, I didn't find much cons .So yeah, definitely go for this phone . Its simply the best in this price range !

"
"

  I Bought Samsung Galaxy M21 really awesome mobile works quickly fast and secure, fingerprint reader fast. Mid range mobile with highly configuration, battery life no issues 2 days i am using even after internet browse and playing online games. Camera auality my review night camera photos i am not happy but in day time taken pictures really good. other than night camera pictures i don't face any issues till now.I recommended my my friends, Company Colleagues and family members to buy this product. Some of them have bought this product on my words they are really happy with this Samsung Galaxy M21 mobile.Thank you so much Samsung and team members who worked on this product for mid range people you guys are doing awesome

  This is undoubtedly the best budget midrange phone in its price bracket. When booting up the phone for the first time, my eyes were glued to its huge gorgeous super AMOLED display with its polished UI, the one UI 2.0. I can definitely tell, the screen is a massive upgrade to its competitors. This is the best ever display I've experienced under 20K. This is coupled with fluid, snappy, and heavily optimized and featured packed one UI 2.0, the best customized UI in the world. Whole UI is designed to be compatible with just one hand. There are no ads and minimal bloatware, that can be removed if you dont need them.The weight is evenly distributed and very optimal. Never felt that I am using a 6.4"" screen with 6000 mAH battery.Coming to battery, initially it was not giving much juice. But after a software update, the battery last even longer. Casual users can run 2 full days without charging. You can even optimize you battery life with builtin power mode settings in device care.Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is fast and accurate.Camera used is very high quality, aperture is huge, hence can capture more light for brilliant daylight pictures. The camera post processing is also very sophisticated, the software can recognize the object with its scene optimizer feature and set the camera settings for the best shot. The camera app is feature packed. Samsung has gone very creative in using the 2nd and 3rd camera in lots of feature. The depth mode camera can be used to create cool photoshop effects (picture attached), while wide angle lens, apart from shooting ultra wide photos is used for super steady video capture mode, which is my favourite. Apart from this it have tons of feature like super slow-mo, hyperlapse, night mode, AR emojis, etc. Most polished camera app I've ever seen.The only cons you can consider are:-Wifi range was not high (fixed after software update)-Not all of one UI features, like edge lighting, dex, knox, good lock are available (most of the features are available btw, not a deal breaker at all)-Gaming performance in not at par with the competitors. (I am not a mobile gamer tho, I put this con from other's review. For day-to-day tasks, this phone is decent).Still these cons are negotiable. Also consider the fact that this is fully non-chinese company. Almost more than 90% of parts are not made in china. Samsung is investing heavily in India. Noida has the biggest samsung plant. Most of the parts are manufactured in India. This is the only alternative to chinese phones.

  I like the display quality...good for reading documents and watching movies..and phone performance ..camera is good except in lowlightBut sound output in speaker mode is not that satisfying.. I dont see any inbuiltDolby feature is less effective than Lenovo  dolby output offered in 6-7000 range phonesThere is a room for improvement  to which Samsung  must work..But still it is best phone in this price segment considering  current situation..

"
"

  Battery monster..At an affordable price..worth every penny..For my use..It is more than adequate..I usaually charge it up to 50 percent.With my moderate usage of youtube whatsapp instagram it gives around 4 hrs of screen on time plus 1.5 hrs of talk time..when I get back to my home after office it will have around 10 percent charge left..That is more than  enough for me..Quite satisfied with the product..other features are also good...Camera.Screen quality..Etc..etc..I dont play games..So I am not worried about the Beast like performance..

"
"

  Camera quality  is extremely  poor it does not have detail, if you zoom any picture congrats,  kaisa laga mjak?.....you will only find it good without  zooming  the pics, it's that disgusting  when you zoom ,like 4 mp camera , realme c3 ,infinix  note 4 gives more detail.Finger print sensor  is good level, you can touch n hold ,to awake screen 1 sec latter, you can just tap and the sensor  will work as fast as you tapped......Battery  is good takes 3 to 5 % in highest  setting in arena of valor...per game , 12 to 15 min. Can vary due to network  weaknessDont know if camera is really  48mp but the screen have 60hz display  with samoled ,cant feel any difference  from full HD LCD screen though,  you are going  for 4gb ram then go for 6gb.....it lags

"
"

  Very good product from Samsung. Meets each & every expectation especially in battery life, fingerprint reader. Camera quality is also very good. Having 6gb RAM, the phone works very fast & the battery takes less time to charge. The device generates less heat while working & charging. Moreover, this phone is not a Chinese product.The only problem which I want to say is that the Seller should take more care towards packaging of such sophisticated product. Otherwise, I am extremely happy with this product & thanks to Amazon for delivering it within estimated time.Thanks once again to Amazon & Samsung.

  Samsung Galaxy M21The worst product i ever purchased by online.I received a defected product with overheating and battery draining issue, hot seems it may explodes, and over heating issue was front screen position, battery seems 2000 mah not 6000 as Samsung Said.As i trusted with ‚ÄúAmazon.in‚Äù  contacted with them over chat to get help on returning the product, they make it more difficult and seems they want to save seller and lose me as a customer.Finally Advised me to install one app (cannot remember the name) to diagonize  the issue(app also not working properly),  after checking in online by sitting from their call centre they found my phone is working well and no defects (stupid fellows), In real the device have same defects.Finally one guy(i was talk with more than 6 different ones for same case from amazon call centre, and that lose my 3-6 Hours) said to take the phone to some service senters and send him report to get return or repair. In fact the product have 7 days return policy (it is completely under responsibility of amazon) that comment made  me very nervous  and i was angry  with him , when he found me he cannot cheat me any more,  him self made return request and i got confirmation mail same time. (Think,! how amazon.in approach an easy matter and how they make it difficult to their customers).So think 3 time before you order such products , and if u have more free time and you have more skill on verbal communication(in fighting) you may not lose money and you will not cheated.Mentioned here the issue in details, to not fall poor people in this trap.Even i am a Big Fan of amazon.ae exactly  well quality  and Customer  oriented service they are providing.

  After going through so many phones, I finally decided to buy this one. I checked the phone for few days, here are my observations -1. Battery Backup - 4/5, no complain for backup2. Fast Charging - 3/5, It took 2.5 hr to go from 5% to 100%3. Camera - 3.5/5, Front Camera is good, On Rear Side it has only, Wide Angle & Ultra Wide Angle but no Telephoto Lens. Zoom only works for Wide Angle lens but it is useless as it is not Lens zoom rather it is software zoom, it means capturing a shot then zoom out to check a spot is same as capturing the zoomed out shot, at least I felt this way. There are few other features in camere like -  in built editor for Slowmo Videos, Panorma, GIF creator.4. Speakers - 3/5, It is avg not very great, although I loved the Dolby Atmos feature, it enhances the 3D Audio experience to next level. Mic & receivers were all working properly in initial few calls, not sure about their future. I have seen many complain about Mic, Receiver after 5-6 month of use.5. Finger Print - 4/5, It is fast, was able to distinguish different fingers even with same patterns.6. Face Unlock - 4/5, It is also fast, had feature to enable/Disable fast unlock but I did not feel any difference when enabled/Disabled. It has option to stop unlock when eyes are close, so no one can unlock while you are sleeping :). only complain is, was not able to detect Glasses, was unlocking with/without Glasses, don't know if this is the feature.7. Display - 4/5, I did not feel much difference between LCD & LED display but I have to believe on experts if they are saying LED Panel have more colors blah...Let it be. Problem is with non-standard resolution, sometimes even 1080p video files are not covering the whole screen, although inbuilt video player has the option to stretch to fit the screen. Faced same problem with youtube videos but sadly there was no option to stretch there. Due to curved screen corner options are also not completely visible with Games.8. I was excited to know whether this phone supports the simultaneous call & internet access on different sim Cards but sadly it does not. You won't be able to use Data with SIM2 if are on call with SIM1. Although both SIM slots 4G LTE.9. Speed & Graphics - 3.5/5, to check speed I installed few Games, I installed Call of Duty 2.0+GB game & NFS no limits around 1.0GB. I did not face any lag with NFS but with Call of Duty faced Lag sometime.10. Initial Memory Usage was 15.0 GB. Phone had many unwanted apps, I was able to uninstall many of them but could not remove the NetFlix & facebook app, only option was to disable them.Although I tried playing games but I feel it is not a gaming phone, Except sAMOLED display, Dolby Atmos I don't see any flagship features in phone.Please be careful while setting up phones otherwise will receive lot of marketing notifications from Samsung. Mistakenly I clicked some options with reading enough & then Samsung Galaxy Store started downloading lot of unnecessary apps, there was no way so stop it, I could get the Download queue, it really made me Sad that a brand like Samsung also do such things. I was manually stopping the apps as soon they start downloading, I spent 30 mins doing this.

  Phone look good. Build quality  also good. Most important best thing in this phone is super amoled display  this display easily  compared  with one plus 7 pro. The quality is top notch.Not get any network issues.Not get any heating  issues in normal useBattery performance  is good but it give 28 to 30 hrs normal use.In heavy usase like continuous  using  it will give you 20hrs.Grafics are superb for this display  light game runs with high graphics and good experience  because of amoled  panel.Processor  not that much week as you thought  its easily  beats sd730g or  g85,90 processor  in day by day tast I am not saying  about gaming.Gamers can play  pubg for max 1 hr because  processor  not suitable  for heavy games it start heating and it doesn't have liquidcooling.Camera quality is very good  details  and all.It's a best mobile for social media,calling,  video streaming,photos lowers, content readers, YouTube,  Netflix,  and basics games , and internet usase. I recommend this Mobile  for them who have 15k budget and non gamer.I used lot of mobiles with  IPS display  and one plus amoled but this mobile display  seriously  you can't imagine the quality  unbelievable  in 15k.Don't go oppo vivo because  in this price range they give you cheap processor  and display and redmi realme  give you fhd+ IPS  pannel and they fool people on sale actually  they sell old models and new launches  have huge  price difference in offline.If want to play  pubg then just go for any g80 g90 processor  you will get it in 10k to 13k if you want everything  then go for snapdragon  712, 720, 730, 845, 855 you will get it in 14k to 20k if you want future proof  Mobile  then go for snapdragon  690 795 865 865+ and mediatek dimensity 800 ,1000 you will get it from 15k to 50k.If you have day by day use and normal use with great experience  and light games then go for exynos 9611 only ignore  exynos 7,8,9Samsung Ui amazing  as compare to Chinese  brands except one plus.Ram management  is superb.Optimisation  of phone is superb.But phone design  is good not great.

  This is my first android phone, being a loyal iphone user for 15 years. I found this phone brilliant for the price. Very good battery life. I use this for my office call on a bluetooth headset constantly and I m charging g the phone only on alternate days.Speed of Apps and touch sensitivity is just perfect.Camera picture quality is impeccable.To be Frank. I have started using my office phone more than then my personal phone ever since I bought it.Even the keyboard spacing is just perfect so no more silly spelling mistakes.Worth a buy.

"
"

  If u r thinking to buy this then plz don't do this mistake. It will give u a bad experience I can bet. I purchased it and withing 20 days it's touch stopped working. For the last 20 days it is in service centre and god knows when they return. Their behaviour is rude. They will treat u like u have done any blunder by believing in Samsung. Mi, oppo, vivo are far better than this and these are the reasons they have grasped Indian Market share. Don't go by the notion of anti China even Samsung is not Indian. Taking oath never to Purchase samsung products in my life again.

"

  Pros:1. Display2. Heating issues - didn't notice much heating issues.3. Samsung service center availability across the countryCons:1. One UI core - is just pathetic. Being a stock android user (Nokia 8.1), One UI experience is aweful. Also, don't understand the point of using different UIs for different price segments. Samsung really needs to reconsider this business model.2. Apps are unstable - some of the apps keep resetting every now and then.3. Battery: even though it has 6000 mah battery, backup is still restricted to 1 full day, with heavy usage and adaptive battery enabled - this kind of battery backup is provided by any other handset. Then what's the difference in having a ""6000"" mah battery.4. Camera: shutter speed is unbelievably slow. You've hold the phone for significantly longer duration to get a good picture. Means instant clicks or sporty modes will not work.5. Performance: is Awful. With 10nm proccessor, it just cannot handle multitasking. App launching time is high.6. Background apps - don't run properly, even if specific apps are configured to run in the background. It's keep stopping and restarting if you move to another app.While this phone may be recommended for the low-medium level users. But certainly won't recommend for heavy users, or even for not-so-heavy users.In the entire ‚Çπ10,000 - ‚Çπ20,000, Samsung launched various phones but with the same OLD and slow proccessor (exynos 9611), which means performance will remain the same.I basically bought this phone as a non-chinese brand. However, it looks like, with the anti-china sentiments growing, Samsung really needs a tough competition from the brands like Sony and LG. Otherwise, they'll keep producing these kind of cheap products with no competition in the market.

  The Policy between Amazon and Samsung service is EXTREMELY BAD. STPL is the seller (pathetic if you ask me) They took 20 days to deliver a common and well known product (after a point we wondered why we didnt purchase it in a local store)The phone began restarting in the middle of call or watching youtube without warning 6-7 times a day in the seventh day (the day right after return of product window closed)Samsung service centre confirmed it is a faulty device. They refurbished the software and asked to observe for two days. The issue is repeating itself again. Now the Amazon customer care person is asking us to go again to Samsung and get a denial certificate from Samsung (which the engineer there is not authorised to give)Why should my Mother (60+ years who has a basic understanding of a phone and unable to travel during a pandemic) go back and forth to Service centres when amazon is sending us faulty products? Why should we compromise and waste our time when the new phone is just a week old and is acting up? What is amazons policy here? What do i do with the faulty device which pretty much is plastic and electeonic waste now? Amazon- tell me an office or warehouse of yours where i can throw it away, for free!The samsung centres execs clearly apologised to us that had we bought the phone from an offline store like Pai or Sangeetha in Bangalore, theyd have helped to replace the item in 14 days with no conditions. but now due to ""Manufacturer Warranty"" they can only provide fixes and not replacement .Amazon is absolutely pathetic for electronics equipment. We thought we'll order few monitors and office gadgets but seeing how ill equipped their policies are, thanks. But no thanks.I need a replacement. Pathetic.

  Not satisfied  with this product.... if u are a moto user earlier then I will suggest you to dont with Samsung  specially with M series.Even after after 6gb ram, mobile getting  slow while typing sometimes got hanged.Being 6000mh battery back up is very less.. very disappointed  in terms of battery back up.  If you are selecting mobile because  of battery capacity.  Please go with moto one power or moto one fusion. Samsung  is far away compare to moto in terms of battery back up.Camera is good..sound could be more better.Over all.. not fully  satisfied

"
"

  Display is very defective and low quality

"
"

  A superb product in this range .The SAmoled display is great I have already used Android like oppo,Gionee but SAMOLED DISPLAY IS FAR AHEAD FROM ANY OTHERS.Battery life is decent if you don't play heavy game then 36 hours to 48 hours depends on your usage.When you listen a music with an earphone you will enjoy a Dolby Atmos sound,SAR value is very less so it's good for your health, camera quality is awesome.Generally it takes merely 2 hours to charge with C type fast charging charger though it has some hitting issue during charging due to fast charging of monster 6000mah battery. The weight is merely 188 gm.

"
"

  Check almost all the boxes for a normal-mudium user , If you are heavy gamer then see other options but if you are fine with moderate gaming this phone is tha one to go.PROS :Super amoled display ( Amazing Viewing Experience )Superb battery lifeGood Camera QualityUI (Bloatware and Ads free )CONS:Slow chargingShort charging cableAverage Processor ( But no UI Lag )In short , go for it if you dont mind slow charging and moderate gaming performance ,Rest it the very good üòç

  This product was ordered on 15july2020,& received on 16 July, Opened on 21july& on 27july it's touch screen completely not working, call can be picked up by ear phone , but name  not shown,asked both Amazon & Samsung for replacement but both refused, Samsung customer care give two service centre address & contact no.,both contact no. we're not valid & one service centre is closed.However found a service centre at far location the technician checked the mobile at closed cabin without customer presence and asked 6K for repairing it by saying water found inside.

  SAMSUNG IS SAMSUNG.I'LL TELL U WHY? COZ, ALL THE CHINESE COMPETITORS ARE MADE IN A WAY THAT THEIR PERFORMANCE KEEPS ON DECREASING WITH EACH PASSING DAY.Have personally used many Xiaomi phones BUT THEY NEVER LAST BEYOND 12-13 MONTHS.THIS PHONE IS BEST....HAVING THE EXYNOS 9611 WHICH IS STILL COMING IN MORE EXPENSIVE SAMSUNG PHONES.

"

  ConsIt's not charging faster, taking 3 hours to charge fully with fast charge support.Videos with 48 mp cam is not possible. Camera quality is not good at photos as wel. No zoom option in 48 mp cam.Screen glass is soo poor.Front portrait is soo bad bluring human faces as wel. It's like basic photoshop editing.Unable to scence finger print sensor on back.ProsOnce battery charged it's giving 2 days battery life for heavy user.Nice screen quality in vivid mode only.

  Considering the price, the Samsung Galaxy M21 is a decent smartphone. If someone can go slightly higher in the budget then there is a Galaxy M30s smartphoneü•∞Talking about this smartphone, it comes with a 6.4-inch SUPER AMOLED display which offers great viewing experience. While, on the other hand, the Realme 6 lacks an ü§©AMOLED display.In terms of performance, it has Exynos 9611 processor which is decent for casual gamers.

AND SUPERB DISPLAY. PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE (I DIDNT TEST PUBG) IN ULTRA GRAPHICS, I DIDN'T  FACE ANY LAG ISSUE AFTER 15 DAYS OF USE.

  Its quite amazing experience using a Samsung Galaxy M21 . I am using the product heavily  & the battery life is quite awesome it give about 9hrs of screen on time . Exynos 9611 is a quite capable chip for moderate gaming sessions,  although there is a slight heating issue present . Camera of a Samsung phone is always best what you can get , also hardware is perfectly optimised for taking stunning pictures.  And an oled display in this price segment is always the best .I am quite happy with the amazon packaging & delivery service.Major con. - the camera has slightly yellow tinge , which I think is a software issue . Iso of the camera is pretty much hing in the normal mode but it can be adjusted in the pro mode .

  Sir, I have bought this product before one month but now screen is not working also Samsung service centre also make more time to handle this problem as they give me a date on 26/08/2020. You come with your defective device we check on 26/08/2020 and repair which long time you know today mobile phone is quite essential to day to day life for business as well as servce personal. Please do some thing. I also buy Samsung A30 and it's screen is also not working just after 13 months so I again make mistake to buy Samsung phone. Please help immediately otherwise I loose my faith from Samsung products.

  I've been using this device continuously for the last 8 days. Features like an always-on display, Samsung UI(without ad) best notification management system and better handling of all the resources allocated. On average usage, it easily lasts for 2 days on precise settings I can use it for 3 days straight. All in one package for anyone. Its size is big that's the problem I've been facing while using and handling the device. It should be in between 4.5-5.5 inches. Cameras are OK. On ergonomics, due to its size, not handy when it comes to using it. Still, far better than any MI phones out their, plus (DON'T BUY MADE IN CHINA TAG).

  This product is an absolute unit. Best battery life and at such less charging time.Camera with wide angle, dark mode and now the AR camera is amazing. Enough to keep you busy all week long just exploring. The only issue is it lags a bit while transitioning from camera to gallery, camera front camera to back camera and vice versa. But with such high resolution pictures it's worth the wait.Finger print is the fastest I've ever used in a cell phone.During dark video calls never realised the need of front flash. Just increase the brightness and entire face is lit. Good brightness to the display in daylight as well.The display is massive and such great colours with a beautiful OS which allows optimizing almost everything.I've had the best gaming experience in this device no lags at all. Everything is so smooth and simple. The game management app is helpful.Weight distribution in this device is really good and doesn't feel like a phone with 6000mah battery.Dropped the phone multiple time on hard surfaces, and still it's working good. No scratches on the display.The speaker reminds me of the old China phones, Very loud but clear.In short this is a best buy at this price range for every type of user.P.S. it's IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh in images by m21 camera.

  This phone is beast because SAMSUNG is always a BEAST. You can go for this device M21 blindlyThe main highlight is its display. Samsung's super amoled display is far far better than any other phone even apple's retina display (apple is worst)M21 camera is really very good üëç.48 MP camera is truly goodEven this phone has single take option which can be seen in Samsung's flagship phones.Battery of this phone is huge I repeat HUGE. I do my online class of 1 hour and only 6% battery goes. 15 watt charger is enough. I don‚Äôt prefer much fast charger because it drains battery too much.Samsung UI is very beautiful I love it.One word GO FOR ITüíò üòª

  Samsung galaxy M21 is an excellent product in a reasonable price.It's similar to Samsung Galaxy M31 except the camera which is 48 megapixels in M21 and 64 megapixels in M31.The fingerprint sensor is very good and easily identifies your fingerprint.Even the camera quality is fantastic.The 6000 mah battery is absolutely amazing, it lasts very long.One good thing about this phone is that it's user-friendly. It is very easy to take screenshot and the phone does not hang while multitasking.Overall it is a fantastic product.I am telling this because I have used both the phones and both are absolutely amazing products.

  Review after 3 days onlyI like the mobile. Mainly for media consumption.  Battery life is good.Display is also very good.Camera is not as expected.Average gaming performance for 1-2.5 hour gaming.Speaker is not that good when gaming. But for media it's normal and as expected in price range. But with Dolby atmos on earphones I think it's very good.UI is very good.But when seen all as a single package, very satisfied by the mobile.Only problem I faced is auto brightness  not detect the brightness faster and decreases the brightness while landscape gaming as pubg.

  Used this mobile for more than a month, overall it's pretty good mobile, Listed best and average features below , Nothing to be bad in this mobile but it has no back cover and screen protector in the box need to pay extra few bucks for that.Best:1. Best display in this Range amoled screen with always on display, you won't find better than this in this price.2. Best battery backup with 6000 Mah with 15 Watts fast charge.3. Best front and Back camera with lot of options, latest oneUI 2.1 update brings many flagship camera features like single shot, UHD video recording,20 mp pro mode,Color portrait, record video in front and back camera at same time etc....4. latest Android 10 with feature rich oneUI , it's butter smooth without any lag.5.fast finger print and face unlock.6. Good call clarify, network reception and speaker and 3.5 mm headphone outputAverage:1.Exynos 9611 processor is smooth and lag free in day to day usage , handle most of the game without any issues but lags in heavy games.2. Back design and front display notch is little bit outdated, not in latest design trend but it has no annoying camera bump, not too bulky or heavy.

  Having migrated from Honor phone, following are my opinions-Pros- Excellent Display, Battery life & CameraCons- Everything except the above mentioned 3 points like Finger print reader & facial recognition of the front camera are very very slow, SMS App & Calling App are are around 2-3 years behind in comparison to the Chinese brands. There are no Widgets for simple tasks like locking the screen & taking Screen shots.Finally it is one's personal choice whether he goes with the Chinese phones with all the best features except the MOLED display, Or with the Korean phone with the exceptional display at this price point.

  1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 5/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 3/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast7.Processor and performance 3.5/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now.. but processor is outdated..8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..Verdict: For this price Its the best choice for a non gamer ...

  Phone heats up easily.Camera clarity is pathetic.Performance and battery is of top quality üëå.Overall its a nice phone under this range.I don't know why samsung camera calirty dropped to this level.Only pro feature is the battery backup capacity .For the battery quality i would give 4/5.

"
"

  I'm a normal user..3-4 hrs. total use time in a day which includes some videos 30 to 45 min., WhatsApp, Facebook and internet usage.Battery consumption is only 50% for a day for my above use.Photo quality is very good than previously I'm using 16mp camera.

  Writing this review post using the Samsung Galaxy M21 For 15 Days.Display: quite a large dispaly which helps to read and watch videos with automatic adjustable brightness to eye which comes out as a very good feature.Battery: 5 out of 5 star to battery I have Lil kid watching cartoons whole daybut it berely ask for reachrge withinn 24 hours, one can easily use it for 2 days without charging.Size: Phone size is quite handy and easy to carry.Camera: comes with exceptional 48 MP which gives an extraordinary camera quality and imaging definition. It's the best camera phoen I this budget with the quality like samsung delivers .Body: sturdy body looks sexy and attractive. Processor. I can say it feels like you are using a high end phone when it comes to phone usage. The 6 gb ram explains the use and apps are executing like in no time. Very fastProcessor : it's the imprassive one in the range all ng with powerfull Ram and quite a large hardy 128 Gig of storage.Overall the Best ever phone to buy in this range. Exceptional performence and what a speed. Best ever samsung bud.

  Dear Samsung, if your pre-installed apps were so important, I'd install them myself. I have opposable thumbs, remember! This aside, the phone is pretty good in all aspects, that is if you are 36 and not a gaming camera OTT watching etc enthusiasts like me. The phone works as it should. Removed whatever I could, snapchat, Facebook and several other samsung apps, hidden the others I could not, installed WhatsApp, Truecaller, Spotify, Paytm, Google Pay and Digilocker and I am good to go. WhatsApp video calling seems pretty clear from my end, who knows how it looks from the other end. I'd never buy a phone without Amoled display and this one fits the very little I use phones for and my pocket, so there goes my 5 star review.

  At this price point best.Display 10/10Battery and charging 10/10UI 10/10Camera 9/10Sound 8/10Game play 8/10U can't complain anything at price point of Rs.125001 thing for samsung it have a charging problem after 2 or 3 month I have this problem with my m10s and m30 bouth. And many other user have same problem. Samsung hove to lock into this matter. But it's in warranty and the Ranaghat service center is really very helpful they fixed the problem within 1 day. Otherwise all is good. Don't know what happened in m21 after few months.

  After 1 month of use ---Pros :Awesome display qualityGood build qualityReally good battery back up - easily lasts 2 days with moderate usage with 4G  internet and location service on 24X7No Lag - even with multiple apps running at a time ( not tested for high end gaming)No heating problem so far ( not tested for high end gaming)Awesome Camera (but NOT as good as cameras of premium phones with same resolution)Camera supported by awesome featuresIn built device maintenance featuresGood fingerprint sensorCons:Takes 2.5 hrs to full charge despite fast chargerHalf of the RAM is always occupied - does not affect otherwise but may cause lags during High End GamingBottom line : Best buy in this price range if you are not a hardcore gamer and  want to avoid Chinese brands

"
"

  I've  been using this phone for almost a month now and I've to say I've almost forgotten the job of charging the mobile. The phone works perfectly without any fuss even in single digit batter life. I bought the 6GB/128GB variant and the RAM really handles multiple apps simultaneously with very good speed. The super amoled display is also crisp and is bright enough in all conditions. The fingerprint scanner is also lightning fast and does very accurate recognition. The only let down is in the speaker volume which looks average (compared to my previous Lenovo K8 Note).

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor:-  works fine , sometimes slow when hands sweaty or wetBattery life :-  Good , sometimes i get even 2 days from single full charge on medium to light usage.Camera quality:-  it is good ,  the camera app sometimes feel slow, like it lags .Overall it is good phone .

"

  Good product from Samsung.Pros:‚Ä¢ Full HD Amoled display is beautiful. I am a heavy OTT watcher and the screen quality makes all the difference.‚Ä¢ Battery life is substantial. Lasts all day for me easily with 30 mins of calls, 2-3 hrs of streaming content, and an hour of gaming.‚Ä¢ Camera is decent. Colours look natural in daylight rather than over saturated. Night mode is also better than i was expecting. 20 MP front camera is the star feature. Selfies are crisp and natural. (not whitewashed like some other phones i have experienced)‚Ä¢ Another thing i really liked is the build quality. Although being extensively plastic the phone feels sturdy and well balanced. Closest to feeling like a metal and glass body phone.Cons (well not exactly cons):‚Ä¢ Only been using for about 15 days now but the phone has not given me any reason to complain yet.‚Ä¢ I would suggest opting for the 6gb RAM version because if you are like me and switch between multiple apps at once the extra Ram seems to help and I can imagine the 4gb version struggling there.

  I am using this phone more then 3 weeks I can say one thing battery performance is really really  good photo quality also nice not uptown mark with  this price range processor service  is really  good we can trust  this phone specially  for cold regions where battery power drops very easily I can recommend this phone to everyone please  take it

"

  Well I got it for myself but I didn't like it so I gave it to my mom it's good but as everyone says Samsung is not user friendly my mom has 2 Sims and the option to always ask which SIM to choose is so tiny u barely can see in the notifications panel and the fingerprint reader can't read your finger even if it's slightly wet other than that it's fast and battery is also great but u need to buy a case and screen guard on the 1st day I started noticing minor scratches on screen on the 1st day and I didn't take my phone of my bed and soft surfaces and the ui is laggy sometimes I switched from realme 5 pro to this and if u already have a phone which is only 1 year old and it is from realme or Xiaomi u will definitely see a downgrade in performance and the battery life is great but doesn't feel 6000 mah and also u can only add 3 fingerprints in thisedit: I switched back to m21 as I missed the good battery life and after a reset majority of the issues got fixed now the ui is not laggy anymore but fingerprint sensor still has trouble reading my finger if it has little sweat or some water but face unlock is good it's hit and miss but u can take the chance as it unlocks 7/10 times but it will take some time if there is direct light behind u

"

  Gifted my mom this phone. It's more than what she requires. Just required a back cover and a tempered glass protector for the screen and its the perfect gift for parents. Camera nd screen quality is as good as any 30k phone. Look no further. Build quality has improved significantly comapred to earlier budget phones from Samsung. Loved it!!

  You can Contact me for detailed information of this Smartphone‚Üí +91 9454925222.I am writing this review after 9 days of usage.Pros of Galaxy M21 :-1) ‚Üí A powerful 6000 mAh battery. It lasts for 2 days on normal usage and 1 day on heavy usage.2) ‚Üí Super Amoled Display. You will enjoy watching every content on this phone compared to other non amoled display phones.3) ‚Üí Decent Performance. I play PubG Mobile [in HD Graphics], PubG Mobile Lite, Angry Birds 2, Subway Surfers and Ludo King , I never felt any lag. However, it heats during heavy games like PubG if i play it for 1 hour or more.4) ‚Üí Good Camera. The camera quality is great, ther colour contrast and brightness is fabulous in daylight shots. Front camera is also Good.5) ‚Üí Fast Charging but not too much fast. It takes 2 hours and 30 minutes to fully charge its 6000 mAh battery from 0% to 100%.I think if it would have 4000 mAh battery then it would take 1 and half hours to fully charge.6) ‚Üí Design. It's beautifully designed, the camera is not bulky and looks beautifulCons :-1) ‚Üí Heating problem. It don't heats too much but it heats. I have noticed that if i go outside in hot temperature, then it heats rapidly but don't worry if u r inside ur house [even without AC] it will not heat until u play heavy games atleast 45 minutes.2) ‚Üí Camera in daylight is awesome. But it is just 'Ok' in night shots even if u shoot in 'Night Mode'.3) ‚Üí There's no Gorilla Glass 5 protection. It comes with Gorilla Glass 3. Most of the phones with Gorilla Glass 5 protection in this price segment.Thank You

  Good phone under 16 k overallDisplay- big display 6.4 and very good smooth touch experiencePerformance- 6 gb ram gives very good performance with no lag at allCamera- 48 mp camera is not up to mark as low light images are blurBattery- battery is decent as 6000 mah in starting it was lasting 1.5 days but after installing apps it lasts 1 day but still i think its very good when it comes to heavy app users like me.Design- nice looking phone and very light wieght with slim bodyFingerprint and facelock- fingerprint is very good and facelock is also dscent works 8/10 times.Gaming- light games runs good but heavy games like pubg gets some lag while playing hd mode.Pros- big battery, display size, performanceCons- charging phone takes 2.5 hours to fully charge even in fast charging mode.Camera not up to mark which i found better in other china phones.I think its good phone coming in this prize however its subtitutes are available in china so better to go for the brand.

  AMOLED Screen display makes your mobile experience better than any mobile in his category. Awesome battery life,  smooth functionality, No hanging-Panging problem, Great user interface.For data security concerned,  this is great option.Overall good option who want to avoid Chinese mobile, good software,  data security.  Design is good.

"

  Pros1. Easy and functional  UI2. Display is pleasant3. Huge battery4. No hiccup in usual usage pattern.Cons.Camera Lags a lotNight mode is Useless,48MP is just a Marketing strategy.Samsung Keypad app crashed  several time.Takes more than 3 hr to Charge.

"
"

  In this budget,we get : good battery life, a terrific display, nice camera, fast charge support, a clean user interface.But little lags are in : gaming(as it can't  be mentioned  as gaming  phone); not as fast charge as compared to other brand but keeping in mind the Monster battery support, it works fine.Last words : For an average Indian customer, it is a terrific experience.Please  support  a non Chinese  product.

"

  I suggest all don't buy any samsung products..Quality (parts) they are using in mobile  is totally worst..Life of samsung mobile is upto warranty period as warranty over within a months fault comes out.. then u have to pay repair charges / service charges..This is the trend samsung using firstly they earn money in selling product after that they earn money in the form of repair..

"
"

  After 15 days of buying the phone, problems started in the phone. First the Wi-Fi stopped working, then the speaker phone started going into the normal mode automatically, then they said they had to do the software, then they did the software, the problem was not fixed, the reverse finger print also stopped working then When he went to the service center, he said that you have to change your mother board, for now, the mother board has gone to change. Now if you have to go round the service center by purchasing a new phone, then what is the use of purchasing a new phone? I have a lot of Samsung products but now it seems that we will have to consider this from the beginning.

  One of the best medium budget phone.I was using Redmi Note7 pro, and was little reluctant to go for Samsung as I did nit have good experience with a Samsung J series phone ( sold it within a week at 3000‚Çπ loss) . So was hard to trust Samsung again.Middle class guy looks for good battery , good camera and a good display. This MONSTER ticks all the boxes. Its been 2 weeks since I am using this phone and I am happy with its performance and delighted with the sAMOLED display.There is 1 con btw.I actually bought it for my wife. But, her sims being 2-3 years old, the phone did not even detect the sims. Both were 4G , and this phone does support 4G and LTE, yet it did nit detect the sims. However, when I tried my sims , it detected.Upon calling samsung care, they also pointed out that the sims might be old, hence its not detecting. So I am using the phone now.So, in all, Me and my wife were both planning to switch from Redmi to Samsung. We are going go request a duplicate sim and then try on this phone to see of it detects.If it does, I am going to buy this phone again for my wife.

  Waste of money.1. After use of 15 days camera is automatically filled with dust (camera protection glass).2. Unable receive phone call, automatic call is disconnected after 2 ring.3. Mobile charger is normal 2Amp.

  Display ~It is the USP of the device.Cameras ~It's okay but the depth unit is just a gimmick.Wide angle lense is nice but not up to the mark of primary lense. Overall you can expect the output similar of 3-4 gen old flagship.Battery ~It's good but it really doesn't feel like 6k mAh. I tested with mobile data (Airtel ; though in my experience, airtel always seems to drain the battery more when compared to other networks) ON all the time, screen rotation ON, always on display, WiFi calling and dark mode ON. It just feels same as 4.5k - 5k mAh device. The phone doesn't have a dedicated light sensor and uses the front camera to identify the lighting situation. So using adaptive brightness drains the battery and is inaccurate and the transitions are not smooth.Performance ~I dont game on a phone so can't really tell clearly about it. The phone felt laggy for the first couple of days but afterwards it was fine. It doesn't lag but you should know exynos 9611 is not a match for the new shiny snapdragon 7XX G series SoCs.Durability ~Well, I did drop the phone just days after buying it. I was using a spigen case tho. No screen protector of any kind. Drop height is ~ 5 feet. No scratches of any kind. It built plastic. Has gorilla glass 3. (Not the best in this segment) but it's okay.In hand feel ~It's um, big. For someone who is used to iPhones this does feel big but is not bad at all. My hands are small though. Can't complain.typing one handed is tiny bit hard but there is one handed mode for the default samsung keyboard.Misc ~Buttons are clicky. Fingerprint reader speed is okay; requires you to have the entire scanning area covered else you may have to tap twice. Display is great for media content. Depending on your taste (many like) OneUI is good. There are things I dont personally like, but again it's personal preference.Just get the base variant; value wise it's the best deal, better than m31. If you dont want Chinese make, this is the only good option at this time. Had it had the latest Snapdragon 7XX chipset for the same price, this deal could've been a steal. Also Raven Black model looks wildly better :)

"
"

  This phone is just ok. Good battery back up. perfomance is good,  no lag or hang.Camera is ok.But the built quality is not that good.As the back body is of plastic material, I can feel a vibration on the back of the phone during call,  if I lower the volume to less than 25% , vibration disappears.Just had technician visit to inspect the phone,  he confirmed this is not a fault, it's just because of the plastic back body.So can't be replaced or returned.Not happy with the product.  Just ok.

"
"

  I am using this phone (6GB , 128GB , Raven Black) more than 20 days and following pros and cons , i have found :Pros:1. Better RAM Management (Smooth Multitasking)2. Super Amoled Display ( Color calibration  is great)3. Awesome 6000 mah Battery (Normal usage extends battery  life upto two days)4.Camera Quality is above average .5. CPU ( Exynos 9611) and GPU ( Mali G72 MP3 ) gives good gaming experience. ( I have played COD Mobile multiplayer and it gives constant 60 frame rates)6. Finger print reader is very fast.7. Android 10 gives smooth user experience.Cons:1. Build quality is average ( Using a back cover is necessary to protect the back from scratches)2. Charger is 15W only and 6000 mah battery, it takes 2.5 hours to fully charge the phone.Final recommendation: Go for it , if you want a phone below 17k , this would  be a great choice.

  I have both the two versions that is the black and the blue colors for M21. Personally I find the blue color more exciting. The performance and everything else is the same.This is actually the best device if you're considering to buy under 13k. Do not go for the chinese products. Redmi Xiomi has been increasing their market presence and now their market price every redmi xiomi phone right now is 1000 rs more expensive than how much it should be. Nevermind.Samsung M21 works amazing and I haven't been charged it once since I booted the phone for the first time with 50% battery. It has been running close to 24 hours now. Camera could have been better for low light otherwise in daylight camera does an amazing job. I don't even have to tell about the screen it it the best possible thing in this device. Processing lags in comparison to the other devices in market but definitely no visible lag will be there. Face id works fine fingerprint works fine and is very reliable. It won't just unlock at random touches. Similarly if you can increase your budget go for Samsung M31. These two devices are rocking the section from 10k to 20k. Best device.

"

  I have been using this phone since a week,No issues or lags have been found yet.Pros.1)Smooth performance2) Excellent battery life3)Crisp Amoled displayCons.1) Average video recording quality (In 1080p)2) Required sound optimization3) Photos are getting warm look after capturing.

  I went for a brand name like Samsung that is what might have hurt me the most. Within 2 months of Purchase without any external damage screen stopped working and service center denied the warranty coverage citing internal damage. Why do we pay these companies who can not make products robust enough to survive even the declared warranty period. I had a total loss in spite of being very careful in handling my new purchase. This is to let you buyers know of darkside of these companies. I am feeling cheated and might won't try any Samsung product ever.

  The phone  is Awesome.when it come I accidentaly drop, but my surprise  screen back all good intake thank God , now my review  I'm not camera guy and not more into gaming,  though I play Sfg2 for 2+ hours daily, experience  is smooth no heating or lagging, and camera is also good with many features,  my priority  was battery  which is Monster and I'm fully satisfied  with it.  Earlier my concern  was that it have big battery  but 15w charger,  It may take long to charge,  but in my surprise  it is damn fast, and also battery  life is very good , battery  bhot kam drain hoti he. Finger print sensor good with some feature  in it. Overall best deal in 15k for 6GB 128gb

  When you are buying a Samsung Mobile it's more about the budget, there are a lot of them in almost every price range. This review is after use of four months.I'm not going for the specifications as you can read them up any time you want.The phone does have a good battery life, it lasts a day if you are a moderate user. The Camera is great and Samsung does have a lot of inbuilt software tweaks that enhance the experience. The Exynos chip can handle work load and the finger print scanner is smooth.If you can spent more then you can always choose the higher options, M31 and M51.It doesn't have the bloatware that comes with the phones in this market, and Samsung UI interface is good.

  Samsung Galaxy M21 received about a week earlier than promised :-)Its a pleasant surprise. After using the phone for just 5 days i'm writing this review.Pros :1)Monster battery (it lasted more than 2 days for a non-gamer like me)2)Superb samsung user interface3)Amazing Android 104)very good Camera¬†Cons1) Battery is not a fast charging type as claimed.. it takes almost 2.30h to charge from 10%-100%2) Low sound (while playing¬† music and even after call connects i barely hear the other person speaking at preset min. volume, I had to increase vol. to 2-3 notches more for calrity).3) Cant add one touch buttons¬†corresponding to system tools such as lock button, torch, network setting etc. on home screen, each time one needs to pull down the screen and access them.Rest all such as connectivity, wifi, bluetooth, bloatware, customizable home screen, floating keyboard, High touch response, pop-up style windows, invisible home, back and recent buttons etc.. make this phone a better choice than its competitors. Overall value for money. Go for it.¬†p.s. Shall update after using phone for some more time.

"

  Powerpacked phone with 6000 mAh gives you day long performance. Exynos 9611 is a decent processor under 13000 rs which gives smooth gaming experience. Display quality is of top notch and camera clicks some of the best shots. Build quality and material used is durable  Ultra battery saving mode is a tweak so that you may never out of power. With Dolby atmos, adaptive fast charging and a Make in India production make it a phone must buy under price segment 10000 to 15000.Review is for 4/64 variant. Peace out.

  Fantastic, bought in May 20, very high quality phone at a very reasonable price point. Anytime better than market flooded Chinese products, Great brand value with quality. The best part is the mega battery, easily runs for 2 days, specially now a days due to work from home on an average there are 2 /3 video conferences daily hence extremely useful to have this large battery capacity.Good fast processor, very nice camera capabilities, happy that I am back to Samsung from my earlier LG mobile.

  Samsung mobiles have the best displays. My reason to pick this mobile was screen as it comes with the AMOLED display. Battery life is quite good but it doesn't come with any fast charger which makes it to take 2hours to charge completely. Call connectivity is decent. The camera is good in daylight and pretty avg during night time. It seems a bit bulky in hand to carry because of a 6000mah battery. RAM management was good. I never played any games but I think it can handle basic games without any issue but have to think if you play heavy games. As the Exynos processor is not designed for the gaming you need to pick either snapdragon or Helio processor for Gaming. It also seems to slightly overpriced when compared to other devices with additional features. Still, Samsung delivers the different experience.

  As always samsung has issues of poor battery life and heat up often during multiple task and gaming. It lag and slow processor get you mad. It's not worth the price. Though the look is ok. Over all not worth the price you could get better phone at lesser or same price with better battery back up and faster processor...

  Phone is overall good.Battery Life & Display are fantastic.Only issue that I face is with fingerprint, with padded cover/flip cover, people with big fingers face difficult time reaching the fingerprint scanner (Please Samsung make scanner area round).Performance wise the device is decent (Samsung please give up on your Exynos thing, its not good enough).I bought this phone for my father, he's moderate user and phone lasts for 2-2.5 days easily for him.Overall good experience with Samsung.

  Writing  this review  after using it for 20 daysPros:1. Good battery  life 9/10 it gives around  1.5 days battery backup with moderate usage2. Display super amoled üòçüòçüòç10/103. One ui  is gr8 and optimized 7/104. Camera is good  in day light conditions and primary sensor captures gr8 images but dedicated 48mp mode  doesnt make any difference  u get just more details when u zoom images. Wide angle lens also capture  good image in  daylight camera struggles in night u get bit of noise  in images and night mode is pathetic. Front camera is decent but not upto mark... overall decent camera performance . 8/10Cons:1.  Plastic back is very much  scratch prone  so u need to use case compulsory2. Charging  speed is bit low as compared  to competition  in market it charges phone from 10% to 100 within 2 to 2.10 hoursFinally performance wise  exynos 9611 handles day to day task  easily without any ui lag or framedrop as far as gaming i have not played pubg üòÖüòÖ but i have played pes2019 which on hd graphics which also worked well.

  *Camera is average but fine in this budget.*Storage : UFS 2.1 which provides fast read/write operation.*Dedicated slot for memory cards.*Display : FHD+ resolution(~403ppi) and looks good which is advantage in this budget.Gaming :  It has GPU( Mali-G72 MP3) which is good for playing games(not tested).Sound :  dedicated 3.5mm Jack available and also you can use type-C earphone.. even my Huwaei P30 Pro does not have 3.5mm jack.Battery : true monster with 6000mAhI have purchased this phone for a friend and he is satisfied with this monster.

  I bought this phone for my dad & it's his first smartphone. I wasn't sure that it was the right choice as I hadn't used samsung for long. Thanks to ""No China"" movement that I got hands on this perfect phone, not just for my dad but even for mellinials who wish to play pubg and all sorts of games. Amazing design, sturdy build quality and surely feels premium. I won't go into technical specifications as they are covered by many here.

  after using 2 months of this phone:;;pros:1.good graphics quality2.good camera at this range.3. battery backup is good enough but again 2000mah of ios and 6000mah is equivalent of samsung.cons.1. very poor built quality. The scree is very sensitive to be broken.2. very lagging interface3. very slow processor.4. took time to call and hang up the calls.5. no back cover provided by samsung.6. even you will face little bit of lag sometime in candy crush.7. you can play pubg but you have to play in very poor graphics setting.8. the most annoying feature is you will get notifications tone all the time but when you open notification bar nothing will appear ..also whatsapp notification have no light alert mode i.e. only sound alert is available..overall if you want to waste money you can definitely go for this..redmi 9pro is best option instead of this...

  This is the only best midrange smartphone you can get in India within your budget and great specifications.In such times, the Korean giant successfully brought people a wonderful balanced phone with extraordinary performance.1. The screen : Its bright, black looks like black. Its AMOLED. So hands down.2. Processor and Graphics : It handles everyday tasks without issues and you can play games as well.3. Storage : Its fast storage UFS 2.1 which makes the M21 lagfree and superfast.4. Battery : Battery is beast. It has given me 7hrs+ Screen time with 22% battery left.5. Camera : It clicks wonderful pictures for sure. And super-slow motion is dope.6. Body : Its a strong plastic phone which looks premium.Overall a Great Smartphone under budget.

  Using from last 15 days updatePros:Display is wowBattery (3.5 star) seems like only about 4000or 4500mah max(though it mentioned 6000mah)but does the job for me ,and lust for 24 hrs.Camera is god enough to take sharp picture.(3.5 star)Good UICons:Bad Ram managementFor my daily uses it lacks a bit... sometimes app crashes.Glitch on the UI(lacks some times)Very poor speaker quality and through headphones is ok ok.Outdoor visibility could be betterFace unlock is  not working properly (I don't bother as I don't use face unlock)NOT TESTED FOR GAMES YET...WILL UPDATE LETTER.Verdict:Can go for this only for the premium quality display and good battery and as a non Chinese option . please go for 6 gb ram version .

  Well, if you're planning on buying this phone, I'm pretty sure you've scoured the internet, read the reviews, and watched the YouTube videos; so, rather than telling you all the best features of this phone, which you already are aware of, I'll give you the rebuttals to the cons mentioned all over the internet wormhole. All right then, let's kick-off.1. ProcessorWell, I'll admit Samsung is quite ungenerous in providing us with a modern processer and has stuck to the Exynos 9611. However, in no way is this processor a bad one. Day-to-day tasks are as smooth as butter, gaming is above average with no noticeable lags. The phone does heat up once in a while, but it cools down quickly too. No real issues here. However, if you're one of those users whose primary use of a phone is gaming, then look somewhere else. This one's not for you.2. 15W Fast Charging and battery backupTo the best of my understanding, most users charge their phones overnight. So, my question is, do you really need a faster charger than 15W? To me, ultra-speed charging is more of a novelty than an essential feature. Having said that, the phone does reach a hundred per cent in about two and a half hours, and given that it has a 6000 mAh battery. As long as the phone lasts for one whole day on a single charge, I think it's more than sufficient for most users. Hell, what more can you ask for?3. Build quality and accessoriesIt's a plastic (polycarbonate) back. No free phone case. No earphones. But... do you really need them? A generic phone case on Amazon costs about 150 bucks, and most people already have good quality headphones/ earphones. Secondly, though the back is plastic, it has a pseudo glass finish and in my humble opinion, it looks stunning. The screen has an apparent curve around the edge and, in a weird way, that's my most favourite feature of this phone. Doesn't feel cheap in any way.4. Fingerprint sensor locationThe positioning of the sensor makes it hard to find, and you'll be groping for it every time you want to unlock your phone, but that's not a real issue for me. I never use the fingerprint sensor. I always stick to security code. It's more secure and safer that way. Biometrics are there only for convenience and not for security. Bear in mind.5. DisplayWell, no matter who you are, you have to admit, the display is the most stellar feature of this phone. However, the protection of the display is limited to Gorilla Glass 3. Easy fix: use a tempered glass screen guard if you're clumsy to dropping your phone.6. CameraIt's decent at this price, but if you want something better then M31 and M31s are readily available. Enough said.Well, there you go. At this price, if you want a phone with decent to above par specs from a well-established brand then, this is the best phone, period (in my opinion, of course).

  I got the mobile on 13th july and today after using it for 4 days....the battery drains out in 30 hours. If u look at the size of battery 6000 mah....it should give backup atleast 2 days or more than that...but from battery point i m very much disappointed.So if anyone looking to buy this mobile....let me tell u that battery performance is very poor considering 6000 mah power.Except battery rest of the things are ok.

  Both screen & body are damaged.Screen  has broken  & body has scratches  on the cornersThe charger  is also defective it is taking more than 7 hours to charge the phone,while a normal charger  is charging it in 4 hours.The keyboard  is also showing  lag & sometimes  it completely stops working . Im not able to type a single letterThe side frame just below  the screen is also made of poor quality plastic it wears out very easily while carring in pocket.It seems like  Samsung  m21 has fake gorilla glass because  it  started  shattering against little impact.Overall  very disappointing experience.

  I placed order on 8th Aug. Amazon delivered a faulty phone on 9th Aug 2020 at 9pm to my address. for an hour or two I was configuring my emails and installing required apps. App installation was stuck by some weird reason. I thought I'll after next day morning. On 10th Aug 2020, right after wakeup, I was trying to switch on my EXPECTED brand new phone, blank screen was showing up. After long pressing of power button for 10-20 times, the screen started showing up. But the touch wasn't responding. I raised a complaint against one to two days simply AMAZON has wasted the time in the name of technical suggestions, which is in vain, as the touch itself wasnt working. At last on 10th Aug AMAZON initiated a technical expert visit, which was scheduled on 12th Aug 2020. No luck with technical expert as well. And then when I contacted the service center, they have PROMISED by 14th of Aug I'll get a replacement, but when I checked on 14th Aug this got updated to 28-29th Aug. I didnt understand what Amazon was trying to do here. They really disappointed me.  I have paid ~16k for this mobile on 8th of Aug, and till 28-29th Aug I'll not have any working worth phone in my hand. Who can accept this kind of situation. I had chatted/called customer care almost daily once after purchasing this product, no one responded for my cause.I asked for refund/cancel the product, I thought if the replacement itself is taking this much time, how many times I might need to call customer care to get the amount the back, so Im patiently waiting for the replacement phone.Nowhere I have seen after paying ~16k we need to wait 20-21 days to deliver a working phone. Not sure whether the replaced phone will also be in same state. Besides this, I have purchased back cover and screen gaurd worth around ~400 rupees. For sure AMAZON wont accept for returning screen gaurd as its opened and applied on the faulty phone. I'm not able to understand why amazon is doing this to a PRIME customer, which they call as valued customers. I'll not suggest to buy this samsung M21. As this experience dissatisfied me, I expecting something worth of spent 16k, instead my time was wasted and will get wasted till 28-29th Aug thinking about the phone. Other than time and money, my impression on Amazon & Samsung products is lowered exponentially.

  Awesome phone. Excellent amoled display. Very good battery. Charging takes 3 hours. It okay. As do it in the morning.  And it lasts full day and night. I can watch 5 movie's online and still battery left at 15 percent. Just to test it. It also has Galaxy app. Which is too good. Sound is Dolby. The vibration effect is too good. I have ordered another one . However price increased by 1300 hundred rupees.

  According to my personal experience this is the first Samsung phone in this price range competing with other brands as far as same specifications are concerned. Plus added advantage of Samsung brand quality. Phone is quite smooth to feel and performance is great too. Definitely a good buy and worth it. But a 256gb variant would be much better.

"

  Display (10/10): Awesome Super-amoled display which provides great viewing experience. Best in the market at this price point.Battery life (10/10): Can easily last for 1.5-2 days even after moderate to heavy usage, also charges pretty fast (around 2 hrs) considering 6000 MW battery.Speed (10/10): The UI is superb and I feel it is much better than other Chinese custom UIs. No unnecessary ads popped up,  unlike Realme or Xiaomi phones. Also, for regular usage I didn't see any lag. For high end games, not sure I am not a heavy gamer so serves my purpose. Fingerprint works smoothly every time, but face unlock doesn't and could have been better.Camera (9/10): I feel the camera quality is again much better that other phones available in the market at this price point. It undoubtedly takes great photos during the day and even when there is adequate light around. However, the phone struggles to take great photos when there is low light, also no selfie flash. But again, no phone is perfect, so it's not a very big issue.Build quality (9.5/10): Considering the massive battery, the phone is extremely lightweight. Thanks to the plastic back body of course. Also, overall build looks pretty decent at this price point.No back cover or screeguard out of the box, so make sure you buy these along with the phone, as the plastic body is prone to scratches. Samsung could have added these accessories, like most of the other competitors.Overall great purchase experience!!!! For watching videos, clicking photos and regular usage, this phone gives a very tough competition in the market. Highly recommended at Rs. 12,699/-, unless you sole purpose is gaming. Have to see whether it gets proper updates in the future. Samsung has a bad rep for that!

  Excellent product... Never regretted.. Its been 2 months using this product..-Battery(5/5) For the first 2 week i was surprised at the battery performance.. i was hardly able to use up 5leven 50 percent of the battery... and i am too heavy user ..Later on started to give one time charge.. and i am expecting a full day battery even with the too heavy use.. this is mind boggling..- Display (5/5)is super excellent the best at this price range.. Super amoled.. i am surprised the quality of colour output... I don't think i will go back any less of amoled screen from now on.- Camera (3/5)is good but not excellent considering the price but surely has lots of features in camera which comes handy all the time like scanning etc..- Build quality (3.5/5).. i really git no problem with plastic and simple design.. I find it excellent in hand..-UI(5/5) user interface is excellent.. this is first time i experienced Samsung one UI.. and i love it.. No adds very little blotware and loads of customisation features.. I am heavy user of phone and still always find something new about the phone features..- Processor (3/5): ok for the processor it's all right for regular use.. Also good for light mid size games but not for heavy apps and very big games for long time..Bad experience- i will be honest the only problem i got with the phone is network problem... The problem is not that big.. happens sometimes.. and i think the reason behind that is low bandwidth from the network operator and not the phone..So overall rating is 4/5 ... I am really satisfied considering its my first ever Samsung Product..

  Review after a month of usage.Pros:1. Super Amoled Screen obviously2. Very good back camera including variety of camera options3. Decent sound volume and good clarity4. Not even noticed any lag5. 128 GB storage major pro6. Awesome Battery life7. Airtel sim gives the best network exp... Very fast ner speed8. Very easy to use One UI 2.0 with so many good handy features9. Earphone output with dolby atmos is outstanding10. Its durable too as it survived 3 falls with no scratches.11. Fingerprint scanner is also fast enough12. Yet to get android 11 updateCons:1.After latest software update, fingerprint reader rarely doesn't recognize my finger.2. After that update battery is like 5000 Mah3. Face unlock doesn't work sometimes4. It will give only normal net speed for jio sim than faster airtel5. In instagram I faced a bug while chatting unlike my old phone6. Front camera is good only at outdoor  conditions not indoor7. Lowlight photography is not so good even with night mode8. Plastic build with old water drop notch design9. Very slow charging 2.5 to 2 h When it comes to processor and performance, it is fluid to use daily usage like browsing, chatting, etc. I play Pubg lite daily which gives best performance with full settings without any lags.My opinion:I'm very much satisfied to use this phone for more 5 years. I easily recommend this for all non chinese and amoled screen lovers. It is worth every penny of 16k.  Thank you for reading my review.

  I bought the Midnight blue, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my father. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my father is average user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my father are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price .

  I needed a phone for my mother and it must fulfill below mentioned conditions,1. Phone should be of a non Chinese brand.2. Phone should have crisp screen quality.3. Phone should have good camera.4.Phone should have latest security features.5.Phone should be free of ads and useless bloatware.6.Phone should not be heavy or feel bulky.7.Phone should be durable and last for years.8. Phone must have good speaker output.9. Phone should look good in hands.10. Phone should have simple interface.11. Phone must have great battery backup.So after keeping these things in mind no brand comes even close to Samsung. And now after using for some days she is totally satisfied. Thank you Samsung & Amazon.

  Recieved the phone a week back.Breaking down the review into reasons to buy and not to buy..Reasons to buy -‚Ä¢ sAMOLED display - Samsung's displays are the best in the market and sAMOLED  display at this price point is amazing. And shifting from an LCD display (moto g5s plus) to sAMOLED the change was quite noticeable.‚Ä¢OneUI - Samsung has done a great job with the interface. I was not expecting it to be this good because i have used samsung phones earlier and was not a fan of that UI.‚Ä¢NOT made in china - 1 of the mains reasons i bought this phone and all the other pros ( display, UI etc.) were cherries on the top. All other options that i had in mind where either chinese or not that great of a product.‚Ä¢battery - this phone is a beast in terms of battery.‚Ä¢camera - camera quality is good. Haven't  used it much, as of now, so can't say much about it.Reasons to not buy -‚Ä¢gaming -if you are a heavy gamer then this is probably  not the phone for you.‚Ä¢ lag- a little bit of lag and frame drops happens occasionally.‚Ä¢ finger print reader is a little bit slow as compared  to other phones at this price point.  ( but if it is because of the security reason then i am fine with it.)‚Ä¢ bezels  - the chin of the phone  is quite big to ignore.Overall i would say it is a good value for money.

  After phone for more than 1.5 months  I am giving my review. I know it's  late but not the end. I think now it is the best time for me to give a full description review.1. Battery  the monster battery of 6000mh which more than sufficient for a normal phone user as it can last upto 2days.2.Camerabrillant camera in this range  with various other features like super slow motion ,wide angle etc.3. Performancethe phone is pretty good for normal user, as it is not a heavy gamer phone . As of now phone does not lag or hang till now.4.DesignThe designs look  is simple .But it does not look bulky or heavy  as it contain 6000mh battery . It can be better than this design.5. Face and Finger lockboth the locks are not fast as it should be.6.Charging and soundthe sound is quiet good and in charging it can take in between  120- 150 minutes. it has no fast charging .7. Screenthe super amoled  HD screen of glass which the best display in this range as we campare to other phone.Overall The super amoled screen by SAMSUNG gives this phone a premium feel while using and it's mega battery and with no lag and hung makes this phone value for money .The one of the best product in this price range and value for money.

Display ratio almost 95% according to body. *Camera* : 4/5,  Very good but only 4x Zoom. *Connectivity* : 4/5, with wifi Calling but, No IR(Infra Red for remote use/installation) Connect Smart TV with 'Smart View' . When connect with the tv phone display get small. *Battery* : 4/5, 6000 mAh (typical) get time 40% to 100% almost 2 hrs. I don't know how does it called Fast charging (Samsung claim 15 wate charger ) it actually give 9 volt output. *Phone Speed* : 4/5, 2.3 GH terbo boost. 1.7 GH according to this specification this phone should more faster than it actually. *Happy with Samsung Galaxy M21 (4GB RAM 64 GB ROM) But Not Very Happy*

  I am using this Samsung m21 phone for more than 2 months. it's a nice phone, in the lower midrange segment it is worth buying on this price.if we have to give the mark out 10 then i will rate like thisBuilt quality : 6/10 although there is not much camera bump. the back is not with trendy glass build, it can be more betterDisplay: 7/10  this is fine and I have been a big fan of super AMOLED display but screen protection is avg with gorilla class 3Camera: 07/10 Both rear and front camera is up to the mark in the class, and have been better after two software update given by Samsung. you can do professional photography with this champOS and Software: 6/10I am a big fan of stock android. so here the Samsung interface is much closer to it but there are native apps with Samsung brand which is a little bit noisy in my case, you have plenty of options for customization. and also for normal use, it is better than the Xiaomi interface. you will find lots of option like game optimization and double social media accounts to usein hardware depth. you can not question on Samsung brandingoverall if you want a phone with this pricing or nearby pricing just go for itbig thumps to Samsung who  make this device for customer

  A very decent phone in the midrange market, but I don't like the way Samsung is using the opportunity(the boycott-China campaign) and raising the price every 15 days!I got my 4,64 variant @ satisfactort price of 14k in mid July, tho some of the tech youtubers told to wait for the price drop(thank god!) in Aug but haha look at the price now.3/5 for no fix reliable pricing. But overall 4/5 for value for money!Display: Jfc!!! Words can't describe how great it's display is... But numbers can and5/5 display!! U can't expect better.Now let's get talk about the smartphone.Camera: ofc one of the major things that makes the difference is the camera. Don't go by the number of cam holes u get in the back. No point of spending 2-3k more for one extra cam(m31).Camera has great details in daylight shots(pic 2)The night mode is decent but not great(pic 3). Keeping in mind photography with mobile phone cameras can't take your career nowhere ahead of  fb/insta or some social media platform, it has a tier 1 camera features and all you need at this range. Also gotta appreciate the camera software of samsung(having used redmi, oppo, asus, iphone), offers a great interface, numerous features and easy-to-modify settings.4.8/5 CameraProcessor: you can find everywhere about the problem with exynos processor of smsg. So if you're a mobile gamer and like to joblessly spend entire day on phone doing stupid things then processor might be a big issue for you, because only time I saw little lag while making a collage pic on a heavy editing app with 5-6 other tabs open in the background, also there's little lag when the camera app is open so avoid that. There's little but heating but that no big deal.3.5/5 ProcessorBuild quality: again everywhere youd see ppl complaining about its plastic body blah blah but go for it it won't matter, you won't like to use it without a backcover anyway also the polycarbonate back gives far better grip on hand but drawback being that its not scratch proof and you'll have a hard time dealing with all the smudges in summer afternoons and that grip thing doesn't work on other surfaces so careful while throwing them on bed. Apart form all that I'm not a big fan of these huge phones these days for its poor ergonomics and weight distribution(Samsung did a good job though maintaining a uniform wght distribution)4.5/5 Build qualityThanks for reading if you have any specific query about other features do ask.

  Fingerprint 3/5Battery life 4/5Camera quality 3.5/5Look & Design 2.5/5Charging 3/5Inside box 2.5/5Value for Money 3.3/5I got phone just 2 days back. Look wise Phone is not at all attractive from backside & Battery life is above average. I think 6000mAH is only in written . It not works like 6000mAH. I think it's 5000mAh. Let's see after some months & Camera quality is average if I compare with realme phones bz I have realme 5 pro better than Samsung m21, 14k is little bit high, but if u exchanged or if u got discount then it's ok u go for it bz I got it @ 11,800 & I took it for my mom.. For this generation this phone is average. If u r taking for u r parents then it's good. Don't spend more than 12k or max 12,500.

  Everything about this phone is as per expectation.  The brightness and vividness of the colors in the display is exceptional. Face recognition,  fingerprint reading and response is very fast. Battery charging is very quick, and lasts 3 days with normal usage. Overall, it is much superior to the Chinese brand phones at the same price.

"
"

  Please do not get carried away with the battery size and the 15 W fast charging adapter which takes little over 2 hours to full charge. It was a utter shock to me that it did not even last a day knowing to the fact that I'm not into games at all. Most of the use was of 2-3 hours of NetFlix a day and an hour of YouTube. I use the Nokia 6.2 which has 3500 mah battery and a 5 Watt normal charging adapter which charges the phone in 40-45 mins to full and easily lasts 22-26 hours in the same scenario.The finger print sensors lag a lot too and do not seem flawless as I found on Nokia!

  I have purchased the 6GB/128GB variant of Samsung M21 phone after using this for 1 month.This phone has never hung up go ahead if you like itThis has a great UI and smooth amolid touchI like the work mode and focus mode also as it hides distractions while work from homeThe battery back up of 6000 MAH is good and goes for days without chargingMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery on usage is easily achieved2.Display:- 5/5Super amolid display and full screen3.Design 6/5It's blues variant has a great finish and gives us a great look4. Camera: 4/5Camera is good on both front and back. But there is a lot of scope to improve focus using software updates5. OS:- 5/5Android 10 is great fit6.Finger print reader: 5/5It has a good finger locking system7.Processor and performance 3.8/5Exynos 9611 is a great processor developed by Samsung and gives them a great framework to improve uponthis is a great phone available to counter Chinese low grade phones (Chinese = not durable) and making India atmnirbhar by manufacturing and creating jobs in Noida India.

  As mentioned by the brand it is really an amazing phone. U can opt for it if u have a tight budget of 15000 . Below this range this is one of the best phone. It's super smooth to use and has a very good camera quality even in dim light the photography is merrily appreciable. Just a problem with it is abt the charging due to its ""monster"" sized battery it needs a lot to eat so the charging speed as compared to other fast charging phones can probably be said that is slow a bit. Bt its just fine as the btry lasts for too long even when used for gaming and other multimedia tasks. I would suggest u can buy this phone.

  1-Battery :-Two day battery standby for normal easy2-Display:-Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3-Design:It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4- Camera:Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5 - OS&UI:-Android 10 with One UI6 - Finger print reader and face lockFace lock and finger print reader are not so fast7 - Processor and performanceExynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now.. but processor is outdated..8 - Charging : No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9 - Accessories :No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..Verdict: For this price Its the best choice for a non gamer ...

  Hi friends,  Recently I have purchased sm-m21 6GB with 128 GB storage...first of all I will let you about  Amazon customer service,  I never  saw this type of worst service from renowned  organisation..Cons of this  mobile:1.performance is worst, it doesn't compete with snapdragon 625, which is available in my mobile purchased 3years  back..2.battery drains very fast, the 6000 mah battery doesn't  come  even 2 days, my previous mobile  Lenovo p2 have 5000 mah last 3 days.3.apps would not optimize  for exynos processors..better go with snapdragon processor mobiles..4.u can't play high end games, without any lag..5.with this price range, better u go with  MOTO FUSION MOBILE..6. Camera also comes under below  average category, I can't believe this phone have 48mp7.charging takes 4-5 hours time to get full charge,  fast charging is worst compared to Qualcomm's fast charge 4.8. U can notice call drops, even we have full signal coverage...it can't pickup signals into home inside..PROS OF MOBILE:1.Display2.Brand name Samsung.

  Hi, I am writing this review after using M21 for a week - It is an excellent mobile in 12K range, you can select with without any hesitation. Far far better than xioami, realme and vivo. Time to give away with chines product and select some better option -Battery - Good battery, normal uses will get 1.5 to 2 days of batter life. Heavy uses will last for a day. I agree on this point that Samsung has work here with battery management. It can be improved with patch. User can remove unnecessary app and unwanted sync server to get the better battery result.Initially it for a day or two battery uses will be high as it is updating lots of app and settings. After two days battery backup will be stable.Camera ‚Äì really impress with M21 camera. I have seen M30s, M20, A50 mobile cameras, It is far better in compare with those. Picture are real and very good colour reflection.Performance ‚Äì I am not a very heavy gamer so for I have not notice any lag.Network ‚Äì Before buying I was hesitation as Samsung use very low SAR value for people health and that‚Äôs land up with poor network. Network quality is excellent with low SAR value. One more big reason to go for this as other chines phone comes with very heavy SAR value and destroying us.Overall ‚Äì Best in this segment. Go without any doubt.

  ¬†It's been 2 months now and the experience is quite nice. The performance of the mobile is good. The touchscreen is very responsive and scrolling and tapping is seamlessly accurate. The finger print reader is quite fast as well and  99 out of 100 times phone unlocks in its first attempt. The photos clicked in day light stands out fabulously however low light pictures or even with artificial light the pictures are bit grainy and aren't as sharp as the ones clicked in day light, yet I feel the camera does perform well given the current price point. Battery life truly stands out, it's a big thumbs up the way everything is optimized tou dont need to charge for 2 days even though phone's display is on for 8 to 9 hrs per day.

  Great Product .. built quality seems much better they criticize in product review on youtube ,Pros:1. Awesome Camera2. Great Battery .. lasts 1.5 days for heavy and 2 days for general use.3. Brand is brand the Samsung4. Display is Amazing .. SAMOLED5. Great Price even after GST Hike6. Dobly Atmos sound .. wonderful using good quality headphones.Cons:only one negative point is not suitable for heavy gaming , moderate gaming is preferred on this phone.

  Pros: Solid reliable durable sturdy built. Secure OS. Good battery.. full night charge on flight mode.. all day no battery issue.Cons: Inspite of 6GB RAM, slower than realme's 4gb phone.No auto power ON/OFFNo compass to detect directionNo black and white Screen for night viewingNo screen recorder

  On a simple note, Galaxy M21 is worth of every penny. Simply, as its advertised, is a monster. A sophisticated device at an economical price, with a super amoled display, exynos processor and a mindblowing 48MP rear camera.  Inbuilt Dolby atmos provides a rich sound experience.  One of the positive feature is it has a provision to hide the inbuilt apps from the main menu list, which in a way was always an irritating feature in many devicesOn the downside, the 6000mah battery is disappointing,  As it last just 24hrs. Because other devices with 6000mah  provide a better running time.Other than that, its highly recommended for mid budget smartphone lovers.

  I am not a gamer hence not sure of the gaming performance but for a normal userbit is lag free actually very snappy. The battery life is just too good. It has stayed for almost 2 days for me after every full charge. Fingerprint reader is works almost flawlessly. It did fail like once or twice. The display is just amazing and I have used a FHD IPS before but this is just phenomenal. I don't think I can ever go back to IPS. It's made in India. Camera quality is good but not the greatest. But with some editing it looks better. I have attached 2 photos. The build quality is not the best. The plastic is cheap and prone to scratches but I bought a sleek hard case and everything is fine. If you are a normal user and mostly watching web contents, just go for it. You won't go wrong. There are a lot of reasons to like this phone and too little to complain. Go for it.

  Awesome camera .. best battery life and fast charging is also work very well .. and the main thing is screen.  No one,, I repeat,no one,, can beat this screen it's really amazing SAmoled display it's just WOW.. Best non Chinese phone under 15k üòÅ ..Don't think ..just purchase it ..if you want best phone under this budget range

  A very good phone at this price range. The other option (read MI) is not an option for me because of my reservation about the owners of the company. The phone has a good battery life for standard use. Screen display is fantastic so is camera. The touch screen and response time of finger print sensor could have been better. Like some said the phone at times face issue with network but that's a trade off I am more than willing to take given SAR radiation can cause long term damages to your health. Overall I am a happy customer. Thanks Samsung and Amazon!

  i bought it for my mom as we were tired of keypad phones having issues every six months, i got a good deal at 12500 in prime sale , got Rs 1500 as SBI credit card discount, phone is quite good in its price range, it's made for general use and not focused on heavy gaming, everything is smooth and fluidic, no lags observed in app opening, this is for 4 GB variant, battery life is a huge advantage of this phone, specially elder people who may forget to plug in the phone like two times a day, in normal usage one can expect 2 days backup , cameras on this phone are decent and get the job done well. i would appreciate if companies reduce the amount of bloatware they bundle with android, you can uninstall bogus apps manually. good phone in its price.

  Guys this phone is really good but please find the screenshot of flickering screen.. it's been only 3 days since I purchased... Please:) if you're using this phone do check with Instagram and Facebook, if there is YouTube link.. because when I am using the YouTube link from Instagram there is screen blinking I am not sure:) whether this is for everyone or only for me... Please do check this before replacement or return time gets over.

  After 14 days of use,0verall review: Satisfactory, NOT very good.1.  1st of all, I am not using any gaming app, still the phone gets hanged up.2.  Fingerprint reader: Very low quality, doesn't work most of the time. Have to open using pattern, MOST FRUSTRATING ONE.3.  Camera:  Being 48 megapixel, it's OK.4.  Battery:  though it's 6000 mah, it's ok.5.  Network issue:  Always low in network data as compared to my other phone.My 1st and last phone from Samsung.

  After 10 days of use I'm writing the review. Fingerprint sensor does not always work properly you should register 1 fingerprint so that it works properly. When I opened box there was some dust I want to ask Samsung authority why there was dust in sealed pack.if you use cover the screen will heat up. Charging is very slow. Gameplay is good. Back panel catches finger print .screen is top notch. Battery backup as expected .little bit network issues ( I think).speaker isn't loud like Lenovo phones.q

  I always wanted a smartphone with amoled screen. M 21 was a good product within a budget. Now i am also thinking of changing my mobile for an amoled screen phone and samsung seems a good option preferably the A series. They are higher priced so i will wait till the prices come down. Thinking of A 51. The service and packeging of seller STPL was very excellent.

  Good product at this price range.The face detection works decent. Camera n battery life is good. If u r student or belongs to working class than d phone stays with you for a complete day with a decent use. Fast charging is just for name sake as it takes 3hrs for complete charge no matter if u charge by keeping d phone ON or OFF but this is not d complaint. I have my friend with d black variant of this model n in dat variant d camera produces slightly brighter images(good for girls). Network connectivity is not full,its 2 out of 4bars which is same like my friend who lives in same locality which I feel should not b d case as it's a PHONE! i av other phones at home with same network n dey get 4 complete bars of connection. My friend n i found out keypad getting hang 'rarely' while texting which frankly speaking should not b d case as d phone comes with 6GB RAM. And this review I'm writing after 2months of my purchase. If at all u get a issue u can replace the product with help of Amazon Agent.The only thing I found is a hype is its battery 6000mAh...

  I bought the Midnight Blue 6+128 model of Samsung M21. After 2 days of heavy usage, I am writing the product review:-1.Battery quality is great. It lasts for 30hrs even after very heavy usage.2. Camera quality is wonderful. Plus the AR Doodle is great. It also has flashlight and The Ultra wide camera is the best. Selfie camera is also good.3. Perfomance is the best at this price value.4.Phone heats up while charging. This is an issue. Phone also heats during heavy usage.5. Samsung One UI is easy to use and is very user friendly.6. Fingerprint reader and Face lock are great security options.7. The Dark Mode and Blue Light filter works good to reduce eye strain during night.8. Strong build quality. In all, I would like to say that I loved the phone. Its a great phone to handle at this low price range.

  I have purchased this phone for my father (non gaming purpose), so I will give pros and cons of this phone from non gaming perspective. I will rate this device on different features:1. Camera (back and selfie) is good, can't compare with flagship but still good for social media and regular usage (4/5) better than redmi or realme devices.2. Battery Backup is great (5/5)3. Display is awesome, it's comparable to samsung flagship phones and other midrange phones can't compete with samung's super amoled display (5/5)4.Software: User Interface is great, no irritating advertisment and user friendly (5/5)5. Charging Speed: it's good, 15W fast charger is provided inside box but it takes approx 2 hours (due to massive battery) to charge from 0% to 100% (3.5/5)6. Design: it's good but lacks premium feels but who who cares as good back cover can be used to make it look premium (3/5)7. Performance: it provides lag free usage in normal usage but can't comment on gaming (not used for gaming purpose) - (4/5)Overall great value for money Phone by samsung (5/5) if you do not play heavy games like pubg.

  Very bad experience. People are Unable to hear my voice in this phone. Connection breaking. Also there are several reasons stated below:Accessories: No accessories(no back cover, earphone, screenguard). 1/5(only charger given)Charging: Charging was not fast enough. From 15% to 100% it took around 2 hour 45 minutes. My earlier phone used to take 2 hour 15/20 minutes.(2.5/5)Looks: Look is the one of the few things I would rate it 5Spec: It is coming with latest Android(Android 10). So it's a 5.Delivery: One day delivery. Gives it a 5.Camera: Camera was quite good. I am happy with it. The front camera is not satisfactory though.(4/5)Software: I really hate the in- built Samsung Galaxy services. Though I had taken my backup. It's of no use as I couldn't get none of my app/setting or photos back from the restore(2/5)Overall rating: 3.5/5Though it's a good enough phone barring the Chinese competition. You need to grow up Samsung. Else 2 years later I might buy a new phone from another company.DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE.

  if you do a lot of stuff on phone, this is for you. But I wish the finger printer reader was on screen also so that I don't have to pick it up every time to unlock it as the current reader is at the back. Can samsung ship a clear back case also with mobiles? Just like xiaomi does? Barring these two small things, awesome phone. It support dual account for apps, so you can run two whatsapp for two sim

"
"

  I am writing this review after 15 days of using it....1. I honestly say this machine has monster battery because it survive for 2 days without charging (using pattern- whatsapp, telegram, 1.5 hours  youtube video streaming and play subway surf for 1 hours each day).....but they didn't provide 25 watt charging support so we there is no fruit of buying 25 watt charger, maybe in future they provide by OTA update...because it takes 2 hours of charging to complete full charge....2. Display is Awesome...I can compare it with redmi k20pro and OnePlus 7T display and the contrast ratio is same of these flagship phones...3. In camera department it is same as mid range phones which are little bit bad in low light condition.

"
"

  This is really a fraud by Amazon and we're sick of it literary. In months time now charging point has stopped working and samsung is asking to visti the nearest galleries which is closed due to lockdown so after buying new this is what we have to face..

"
"

  This mobile is not meet my expectations. It's camera is like as it is 5 mp, it's battery drain fast, most of it's Ram & phone memory covered with it's inbuilt app, it is heat while talking and so many other issues. I send back this phone but still I didn't get new one or cancel my order from 14 days.

  Budget phone from Samsung with some cool features and user experience. Never expected this much from a budget Samsung phone.Pros :1.Camera : one word it's great. It has every feature like super slowl motion , hyperlapse , 4k video recording , emojis creation..etc..The camera is super good at day light and high intensity conditions. But it's average at low light conditions. But still you get the coolest pictures.2.Display : Nothing to say about it as it is a Super amoled screen Full Hd + from Samsung. It's so comfortable to watch the screen.3.Battery : With massive 6000mah battery it stands up to its mark. Best in the market.4.Build quality : It amazed me with its build quality. A car has crushed my phone on the road and I thought the phone is broken into pieces. But surprisingly nothing has happened even no scratches to camera or fingerprint (though the screengaurd has slight cracks) .5. Other features : like Dolby Atmos , Focus mode , Pop up view for apps like WhatsApp , messaging , YouTube etc.... everything makes this phone great and easy to use.Cons : there are not much cons I found , some like Average camera at low light , sound is not great but it's loud .Overall it's a perfect booster for its price segment which I bought at 12700Rs.

  A very handy phone to use very nice bilt quality. And and very comfortable for one handed use and Impressive and immersive screen which can play 1080p60fps very smoothly and it's battery is very long lastingCamera quality is very good we get 48 mp camera and can record very good videos and take very sharp photos. Finger print sensor is responsive and some may lag due to dust on itLastly it's a very good Phone in the budget range.

"

  This is my first Samsung android mobile. I was more interested in the Camera 48 MP etc. However, be aware if you have used ever a Sony/Moto sets then this camera will appear only a waste purchase. The quality of Camera is worst and should not believe on promotions. Zooming using any lens option is too worst.The mentioned dolby again is setback if u hv ever used Sony.Its better to pay a bit more and go for real promising brands. However battery is good comparative to Sony/Moto.Overall I am not happy with the M21, even many of the options seems to be missing.

"
"

  A big no to M series they are not good they won't support earphones (i use original Samsung earphones) all the time disturbance and it says fast charging well no except it's written on the adaptor and while you charge it's written on your mobile screen it take too ling to charge just like an 2 year old mobile phone camera is good

"
"

  A really good phone in this price range. Been using it for a month. Battery is a major plus. never had to worry about running out of charge. Even at 30%, it lasts me a day. Camera quality is good. I was using a A50 earlier and I didn't see any difference or miss any major features really.A tiny but bulkier compared to A50 but you will get used to it.

"
"

  I am writing this after 4 month of usage and its still works like a new one üíû Best smartphone under 14000 BEST CAMERA, BEST FINGERPRINT SENSOR. And in camera the most amazing thing is its wonderful WIDE ANGLE. The most amazing thing about this product is its battery life it lasts upto 2 dayes when fully charged and amoled screen gives you real experience of watching videos or movies and its looks is also just awesome simply if your budget is 15k go for it. Hope that mine review will help you. Have a great day ahead

  I never expected such a potent mobile the performance of which would outrun most of the smartphones I just bought for almost twice the money!! First thing that impressed me is that its so budget friendly! With all the features included! And trust me the 6000mah battery and its fast charging feature is just amazing, loved it!!!! The camera I must say is so good! And this feature which includes the picture depth , I havent seen in any of the smart phones i have used so far. Quite impressed. I would give five stars from the depth of my heart! Would never regret buying it especially when it came with low radiation compared to all the phones i have used so far..

"
"

  It's the 4 day since I have been using m21. ‚óèOverall performance is good.Battery life is better than iphone 6s plus whi h ‚óèI used before this. A full charge lasts for around 15-16  hours with excessive usage.‚óèCharging slow... I am seriously disappointed with this. They claim that it recharges to 100% within 90 minutes or earlier but actually it takes around 3 hours to charge fully. The ""fast charging"" usb C is a misnomer here.‚óè Camera is 20 (front) and 48(rear) but thr picture quality is not really good. iphone 6s plus got me clearer pictures with just 12/5 mp. So this 48/20 combo is comparatively worse.‚óèUI is really good. But it also lacks some useful features.‚óè 6GB ram seems a monster but the processing is slower and the apps claim 70% of ram without giving an optimum performance.

  Charge and Battery life:  The mobile was all I expected even though it takes 2 hr 30 mins to full charge its huge 6000mAh battery. The phone stands for almost 2 day battery life with 1 hr 30 mins of heavy gaming. Multitasking is working awesome.Memory management:  The one ui 2.0 Helps a lot. And the main point to note is that this phone has the best memory management among the devices from 10 k to 20 k budget.Camera:  The camera of this phone is as expected for this price point it is good for most of the shots.Build and look:  The plastic back is not very good looking but the black color looks well in it. The fingerprint sensor is almost accurate and fast and recognizes the fingerprint well almost every time.Performance and Gaming:  The performance is as expected for a mid-range phone. Samsung used one of their latest chipsets Exynos 9611, which is good for ordinary usage but for gaming it is neither bad nor best. The games run smoothly in medium graphics and high frame ratesDisplay:  The best feature is the display. It packs a super amoLED display with Full HD resolution. It is bright enough for outdoor usage and the color reproduction and sharpness is what you get with a premium flagship phone. Samsung really overdid the display capability. So this beats all the mid range phones with it's display capability. But it uses a gorilla glass 3 rather than latest 5. But it is also good for ordinary usage and does not require a tempered glass.Overall:  It is one of the best buy budget mobile in 2020. But if you are willing to go for a higher cost purchase checkout m51 which uses snapdragon chipset and 7000mAh battery.

  Bought this M21 as a secondary phone and I must say I am thoroughly impressed by its perfromance. Let me start with mentioning the Pro'sAmazing Screen - The screen is amazing to look at and consume contentInsane Battery - The 6000Mah battery easily lasts 2 days with high usageCamera - The camera is also outstanding for the price you pay, images are punchy and bright, night mode works fine tooUI - One Ui is by Ui One of the best Android skins, it's easy to use and very intuitiveFingerprint scanner is extremely quick and responsiveCons -Bigger battery takes time to charge but not a deal breaker for meSingle bottom firing speaker can get muffeled by the way one holds the phonePictures sometime are over saturated but again no big deal.Over all 5 stars to the phone for my usage.You can definitely consider this if your usage is primarily work, social media and content consumption.Good Job Samsung

  Phone is slick and handy (as compared to M30s which is super bulky).Everything else worked ok until all of a sudden touch screen stopped responding. Tried soft/ hard reset, nothing worked. Now the phone is with service centre who is investigating. Got to know from a friend, same thing happened for his wife‚Äôs phone and it had to be replaced.Buy it if you want to experience this pain and agony.

"
"

  M21 is an awesome phone in it's price range and according to me if anyone has to buy a phone during Covid then he should buy this phone because apart from this nothing is available now and if it is then there will be rise in amount from 1-2K . This phone is really good but one thing needed in it that's back cover. Samsung missed that but nothing worry it has a gorilla glass 5 protection and if anyone wants to buy it then you can find a good one at 100-300 Rs. Samsung is all time favourite brand of Indians.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is a poor manufacturing phone. The purchased on 15th Aug stopped working withing 15 days. Service center took almost 20 days plus and person have to followup on the status on daily basis.Do not go for M21 series as defective piece  is of high probaility .better go with offline purchase. As majority of defective samsung phone are sold by Amazon. Even customer care of Amazon didn't help to resolve the issue and showed me 10 days return policy

  I will write a detailed review of my experience with the device.Before buying I wasn't much interested in the device because of the Processor. I wasn't even interested in looking at other specifications because of the Processor. Anyhow I bought it for temporary use. The performance of the device completely changed my opinion.The device excels in every aspect in this price range. The Processor is a very decent and capable one. It delivers upto the expectations. Don't just look for other devices because of the on the paper. This device manages to deliver practically. It will not disappoint you and can play high graphics games without lags.The only drawback back was the stability of the camera, but has been improved with the recent update. Also it gets warmed up when playing high graphics games for loger duration, but gets cooled down if you are running an AC or a fan.This Really is a MEGA MONSTER Device.

  After 1 WEEK EXPERIENCE.) (using the same phone for writing review). If you need a phone for handling all your meeting, accounts, notes, pdf, documents and anything related to daily task with a couple of hours or less gaming, This phone is made for you. 6000mah battery compliments the package+ SAmoled screen flaunts its luxury + a camera which does not pop up colour much but shows the actual colours and environment in the clearest way possible. You can run Pubg with excellent graphic settings. It does not feel heavy. It is a RELIABLE phone on the market. NO BLOATWARE, ADD clean User Interface with few Samsung apps which increases the productivity with this phone. I would prefer the 6Gb/128Gb one as it amazed me and takes the whole new phone on the next level in terms of ON HAND usage. If you once decided this phone that it is perfect for you or struggling to decide just for once see the company difference and company reliability.

  * Coming from an iPhone 6, this is a monster upgrade.* 6 times the RAM, almost 2x the weight and screen size.* 6GB RAM works fast, doesn't lag or stutter.* Speakers are good, camera is excellent.* Back panel is a fingerprint, dust and scratch magnet though!* Please buy a good case before or with the phone.* Went 3 full days for 100-to-0 cycle with moderate usage: music, mail, Twitter, Reddit, Slack, calls and articles.* Due to the 6000 mAh battery, the phone is reasonably bulky - but worth it.

  Battery life- 8-9 hours on continuous use of internet/videos/gaming.Secure folder/S Secure- NACamera- front and rear both are classy.Fingerprint reader- its fast but the finger has to be put in exactly same angle in the manner you registered.Processing- no lagging in regular apps. May lag for some milliseconds for camera and heavy gaming apps.Display- amazing s-Amoled with regular blue light filter.Speakers- very clear and loud sound. Better than other M series phones. Standard dolby atmos with headphonesCharging time- 2 hours. May heat up little while use during chargingWeight- may feel little heavy in one hand operation after 40 mins.UI- new samsung one. Its best for any age group.Outer body- plastic. Better to have a cover for it. Easy to catch scratches and finger impressions.Its ideal for an average regular smartphone user. Not to buy for hardcore gaming.

  I TRUSTED SAMSUNG BRAND BUT THE PRODUCT IS VERY BAD CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY BAD CONSIDERING ITS 48 MEGA PIXEL CAMERA VERY BLURRY AND NOISY VIDEOS EVEN PHOTOS EITHER WERE OVEREXPOSED IN GOOD LIGHTING CONDITIONS OVER WERE NOISY IN LOW LIGHT PLZ DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE AS ITS HEATS MORE THAN MI PHONE AND THE PROCESSOR EXYNOS IS ALSO VERY BAS EVEN WHEN COMPARED TO SD 660 WHICH  IS AROUND 6 MOTH OLD PROCESSOR GAMING PERFORMENCE IS ALSO VERY BAD I LAG I N MEDIUM TO HIGH SETTING IS PUBGAND THE CHARGER WHICH CLAIMS 15 WATT FAST CHARGING IS FOR NAME SAKE IT TAKES 2 HRS AND 20 MINUTES TO FULL CHARGE SERIOUSLY NONE OF ITS COMPETETIORS  TAKES EVEN AN HOUR TO FULL CHARGEONLY THING GOOD IS ITS AM0LED DISPLAY

  I am using this phone for almost 3to 4 months... overall experience is good...but there are some issues like heating ,some hanging ,like you can't play games on this for long time and when you open the camera app phone heatup automatically and juts froze for a while .till facing the camera app issue .and the camera is quite good not up to mark...the best thing is the display ...it's bets of all.

"
"

  The Display is superb in the segment.Camera quality is average, nice stabilization in video mode.Battery backup is more than enough. I can use it for 1.5 days under heavy usage?Performance is decent. Doesn't lag much but the UI crashes sometimes. It might be software bug.Charge time is around 2 hours.Samsung provides updates time to time.Cons: Price could be a little lower.Performance is lower as compared to other companies phones in this segment.Samsung should hire better people in marketing and design team. They don't know how to strategically make devices and price them. Samsung A21s is crap in front of M21 but still priced higher than M21. Doesn't make any sense.

"

  Battery life is good but charging takes more timeFinger print reader is average only, some times we have to out finger 3 timesNo lags, no hangs, display is butter smooth to operate, and amoled colours are very bright and vividProcessor is exynos9611 so far no problems, works like a charm but after 1 year how this processor performs we don't know, if they put snapdragon 660 or something like that, then this is world best budget phone

  Honest review after using Galaxy m21 for 5 days -1 - Phone body - Phone body couldn't be note cheaper than this. Paint is just getting of after each passing day.phone looks years old in just 5 days.2 - Battery life - 6000 mah is a joke. Battery doesn't last a single day. Also charging is very very slow.3 - Fingerprint sensor - Sensor is too slow to response. Sometimes you just end up scrolling your finger and it will not work.I found Samasung Galaxy very cheap and pathetic. Don't flow in emotions and choose this over chinese phone. They are way better. I am regretting my decision to buy this.

  Awsome phone! I'v been using it for about 2 weeks now, and it was a good experience.The interface is very clean and simple.  It has some preinstalled apps which  can be uninstalled :) The battery backup is also amazing.Battery life -Although  it takes about 2 hours to fully charge with a 15W charger, the battery is amazing and I use it for about 7-8 hours a day for studies , video streaming and gaming, etc, and still 30% battery always remains unused.Camera quality-I must say , that the camera quality is great for the price . The portraits have smart finctions which automatically adjust the brightness , contrast, etc.You can even adjust the background blur of the portraits after clicking the photos. I have shared some pictures clicked by this phone. Please check them out! Apart from that it has many more modes like night mode etc.Display-The display of this phone is also a major highlight the colours are very vibrant as you can see in a photo which I have uploaded.Drawbacks-This is an honest review so I must list some drawbacks. the face unlock option is a bit slow sometimes but nevertheless the fingerprint scanner makes up for that . While charging the phone it heats up a little bit. But that can be ignored because of the price and the great battery life.Other features-Some other features which I like a lot are are a dark mode available in the settings and  alsodata saving mode which is also very useful. It also has a gaming mode which can be useful for GamersConclusion-The overall performance  of the Galaxy M21 is fantastic. You can watch movies in full HD all day long without worrying about the battery. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who once who wants great battery backup up with an amazing display and great camera quality, all of it packed in in such a great price!

  I am writing  this review after using my Samsung galaxy M 21 handset for 1 month.Appearance: beautiful and better if you purchase cover and glass protector along with mobile.Processor: Perfect for the persons who use it for daily usual activities and for office use. It works flawless and rarely hang.Sound: here it needs improvement. Sound is less than other mobiles of similar range even on full volume it does not give you dancing feelings.Battery: ok, you charge once and it is sufficient  for 24 hours with data on.Camera quality: Highly satisfactory.Value for money: with a brand like Samsung it may a universal choice for people who dont want to purchase china made mobiles.

  The camera quality is pretty good. It has modes like a dslr. Food photography mode is especially good considering the 3 cameras it hasPhone works like a breeze. Signal reception and call quality is very goodWorth the money and samsung has hit a sweet spot to compete with the low cost phones from other manufacturers

"

  Like :I like the battery the biometric and the camera of this phone this was its main highlight only.Dislike : the phone heat quickly by normal use . Too many bugs in this phone . The 48 mp camera takes too much time for clicking.Charging takes upto 2.30hrs. Not bad but atleast it should be 20W chargingInstead of 15W.  Thanks

  I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant .-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a hardcore gamer then I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.

  Best Budget phone from Samsung under 20k. I ordered for the 6gb 128gb Raven Black edition and ita awesome... Camera quality is great although I didn't find the 48mp camera too much helpful as the details are similar to 12mp mode the portrait mode is very accurate and the wide angle csnera is also good. The selfie camera is well detailed and captures great pictures. The screen display is very accurate although the brightness is low according to nowadays standards but it still works.Overally it's a very good offering from Samsung in this price range.

"
"

  Galaxy M21 is a great budget phone by Samsung for the price. It has a great battery which easily lasts 1.5-2 days. Day to day tasks are handled well by Exynos 9611 without any lags. Camera clicks decent pics in day light, but average pics during low light conditions.Suggested Improvements:1. I hope Samsung provides faster 25 watt charging in the next revisions of M21, as 15 watt charger takes more than 2.5 hours to fully charge the battery.2. Also hope Samsung starts using better Exynos or Snapdragon chips which provide much better performance as compared to Exynos 9611.To summarize, M21 is a decent budget phone offering decent specs for its price with Samsung brand value.

  Hello guysThis is my review for Samsung galaxy m21.I m an electronic engineer who better understands what technology actually means.Now come to the pointWhat are the important key factors which everyone looks into a smartphone?1. Design2. Brand3. Camera4. Processor (performance)5. Battery6. Software7. PriceThis 6 factor are important factors which everyone keeps in mind before buying a smartphone.Everyone has there own point of view that what factor is most important for them.Now my first factor was the price so I was looking for a brand who can serve me better service in the mid-range price. We have many of the brands in the market to whom we can compare. I have searched many of the smartphone reviews and seen articles of the newly launched smartphone in the past 6 months and have seen large number of review.I read a review that Samsung is improving quality as per need in the most buying segment mid-range smartphones. Samsung products are the long term use of products just because of there quality.So here I start comparing all of the smartphone performance in terms of1. Display2. Camera3. Battery4. Price5. Processor ( day to day usage )6. User interface7. Brand trustabilityüëç""Here Samsung M21 wins ""I ordered Samsung M21 smartphone raven black with 6Gb ram and 128 Gb internal storage and i got it in 4 days in the lockdown situation.I got the device in the box along with 15w type c charger, papers etcI am using this phone for almost 5 daysNow, I become a fan of Samsung super amoled display you can compare it with any other mid-range smartphone display.Processor performance with Samsung one ui 2 and super amoled display giving it a smooth and a premium feel.Day to day performance of this mobile is awesome.No doubt about the camera performance of the Samsung M21 smartphone, it click stunning pictures. Please do not waste your time in comparing camera samples of Samsung M21 smartphone with the other smartphones.Battery performance is also good it can last for one and half day OR one full day depend upon your usage.Charging speed is also good enough for me I wakeup in b/w 8 am to 10 am always seen battery remains 20 to 40 per-cent I put my mobile on charge once in the morning and get a full charge in 1 to 1 1/2 hour then I switch on my mobile data I use my mobile for a whole day in calling so many clients, using social media apps, watching movies and videos etc I go back to sleep in b/ w 12 am to 1 am then I switch off my mobile data.I did not fully discharge my phone as per my usage so if you want to charge it from zero to a hundred maybe it would take 2 hours to charge.Finger print sensor is also pretty responsive.Now I am fully satisfied with the Samsung M21 mobile and using it without any restart of the phone.Samsung is the south korean company presented in indian mobile market from so long yes it is a trustable brand.In My opinion, you can buy it without any confusion.Thank you

  This Feedback based on my experience , not on technical specification. I am using it from last two weeks and found some pros and cons of the phone which i am sharing below. I upgraded my phone  from moto g5s plus so my comparison is based on my previous experience of moto G5s plus as a benchmark.I am not a pro gamer and I used it for regular stuffs. However my screen time is more than 6 hrs per day.Battery : Excellent,  Two days of backupDisplay: Excellent,  even much better than my previous phone.Design: it is not as premium as other phone in similar price range.When I checked this phone on youtube video, it look very cheap,  however after holding the Phone by myself it is not that bad. And ergonomics are also very good, even better than my previous phone.Camera: Actually I am a pro photographer so rarely use mobile camera to capture pics. Compare to my previous phone , camera is very good , front camera is awesome i used it during video call in low light situation and quality was gr8Operating System - Better than Chinese phone in market, its clean with limited pre installed app. However if you have ever used stock android in your phone then please avoid this phone. Samaung One UI is great for those who have not used any stock android phone. No issues as such but it all depends of your liking.Finger print reader - BAD, it is ok in normal usage but if your finger is wet(Sweat) or have some moisture/ oil then it will not recognize your finger print which is very irritating. This was not an issue in my previous phone. Placement of finger print sensor is also not correct it unlock the phone many a times while taking in/out from the pocket .Processor - Ok , not as good as my previous phone. However I have no complain. Charging time with 15w charger is too long. Seems it's not a fast charging.Call Quality: It is OK, not sure but sometime other side person not able to listen me properly. This might be network issue but not having such issue in my previous phone at the same place (at my home). Speaker is not loud as moto G5s plusI am also having issue with auto rotate feature. Many a times it(gyro) didn't recognize the orientation of phone and rotate screen/image/video incorrectly which is very frustrating. If anyone else having such issue please let me know.One more issue while taking screenshots.  It is like hit and trial, never captured in single attempt with power and volume down button.I would recommend this phone over Chinese phones (except stock android phone)  to non gamers and to person who want a excellent screen and longer battery life.Not recommend to user whom had used stock android or Motorola's phones. You will miss many feature's like, one key navigation, quick torch/camera function, 3 finger screenshot etc..It is value for money if you are looking for a non chinese phone.SAMSUNG (if you are reading) please provide a better processor, better build,  headphones, cover, screen guard and at least a splash proof body in this price range.

  Purchase this Samsung M21 never give a chance to regret you.. Go ahead...üëçI giving my opinion by point to point on this ""MONSTER"" :1. Battery :- 4.5/5It has a 6000MAH Battery and claimed two day battery standby for normal use but in real it's work normal not much loke monster.2.Display:- 5/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design: 4/5Looking very nice, it has a 6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Not glass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers4. Camera: 4/5Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available..5. OS&UI:- 5/5Android 10 with One UI6.Finger print reader and face lock : 4/5Face lock and finger print reader are working smoothly but need some more improvements.7.Processor and performance 4/5Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer.. No lag ang hang till now..8. Charging : 4/5. It fast charging but Provided with a 15W charger and it's takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So you should immediate order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order because its backbody is plastic amd getting scratches easily..10.Loud speaker 3/5Loudspeaker sound level is not much louder.. (Keep earphones)Verdict: For this price It's the best choice if you are not a hardcore gamer. You never regret. ...

  My model: Samsung  m21, 6GB ram/128GB, purchased in 15K.Pros:1. Performance: very good and smooth.2. Display: sAmoled protects ur eyes. Excellent3. Camera quality: Excellent scene optimizer, Beauty selfie mode, good night shots, super slowmo mode, macro shots, pro mode etc I have shared 2 pics.4. Ram Management  is excellent. NO Hanging problems.5. Batter quality 6000mAh:for basic usage: 4 days+Medium usage with some gaming: 2 daysHeavy usage n heavy gaming: 1 day.Charging time: 2.5hrs to reach 100%6. ONE UI 2.0, Samsung provides mind blowing  software features which no other company gives.(some are Dolby atmos, Bixby vision, wifi calling, power modes, ultra data saving modes, secure samsung browser, AR emoji, and lot more.)Other features like: AI Gesture and motion control, One handed mode, panic mode, focus mode, reading mode, etcSuper fast Fingerprint reader7. No Annoying or Vulgar Ads. Which are found in Chinese  brands like oppo, mi, Vivo, realme etc etc.8. There are lot other life saving features in this phone which I didn't know before the purchase.It's not Cons:1. It's the best phone in its range with all that you need.If you think polycarbonate body and 15w charging can be con as compared to realme fast charging and mi glass body.You better rethink on that, you have to compromise with inferior software support and bad ram management  and bad optimisation and security issues, data leaks, useless apps and ads in the Chinese  phones such as mi, redmi, realme, oppo/vivo, etc.I would Recommend u to buy and put ur trust on Samsung  brand which provides best software support and best device in ram mangement.PS: There are No security issues or data leaks in samsung phones.Samsung cares for privacy and data security of user.Improvements needed in this phones are: loud speaker, fast charging of 24w+.that's all for this price segment.Previously I had already used mi, oppo, realme phones. And I switched to samsung last year and I am happy with that. I also have M31 but I would say M21 is a clone model except camera setup.I will keep updating.....my review in future.

  Fingerprint sensor is fast. Sometimes it takes time to recognise your fingerprint but wiping the sensor once fixes it. The battery life is excellent. Even after continuous long use battery drain is better than other phones in the same price point. Camera is again good. The triple rear camera clicks high quality images and automatically saturates it. Front camera is also decent. The SAMO-LED display is fabulous. Touch sensitivity is fast and the display is fantastic. The back side of the device is made up of Polymer i.e. it has a polymer body which makes it reliable to scratches. Using a back cover is recommended. Android version is Android 10 and the User interface is easy to use. It is stable but sometimes, some apps crash ( in my case , Instagram crashed ) but a software update fixed it. The Dolby Atmos is crazy. It just gives an enhanced experience while using headphones and the best part is that you can modify the treble , base etc. etc.  If we talk about gaming then the first game which comes to our mind is PUBG Mobile. I have the 6GB RAM variant and in my device , it supports HD graphics at a high frame rate( with shadows enabled). I usually play in Smooth graphics with extreme FPS and it gives me around 50-60 fps. But if you're planning to play for a longer time , then the device may heat and you may experience lags. Playing in a room with AC can fix this. Now , if we talk about the charging then the charging speed is decent as it is a fast charger. Overall the phone is best for its price. It may have some limitations but for this price range it is a beast.

  The phone was received on the expected delivery date.It was in good condition, even though the packaging had no protective buble wrap.As expected of samsung amazing features for this price.As though backside looks a bit cheapI'll be using a back cover,product quality is good with its features . Camera as many functions and not so much for photography its features support good video recording with in built stabilizer and slow motion effects.

  I am posting my review after 8 days of use this phone.Storage - For a normal user (not game player) 4 GB- 64 GB combination is pretty good. Now in today's tech world, there are options available like Google drive and one drive, we can leverage cloud technologies rather than invest in in-house hardware.Build Quality - As per my view build quality looks good and no issue with that, as this is the mid-range phone you don't have to expect metal body. I saw some reviews for other competitors in this range and they are providing polycarbonate shinning back panel but that doesn't matter if we use the good back panel as per choice.Camera - Front camera 20px with flash and back camera and 48+8+5px back camera giving decent photo and 4k video shooting.Battery - No phone giving 6000mh battery, also as I observed it's charging is so fast though it is 15w charger. The performance of the battery is up to the mark, 2 days after 100% using prime videos for prime time.Operating System and processor - Latest Android 10 OS which is simple and easy to use. 2.3GHz Exynos 9611-Octa Core processor gives decent performance for heavy usage as well.Display - sAMOLED display gives a cool and nice view.So my opinion is, this is a good phone under budget 15K, don't compare with other competitors because we know finally the brand is Samsung. (Also I have ordered this phone because it is manufactured in India.)For normal users and game lovers, this phone is a perfect package it satisfying the requirements of both. Hope this will helpful for new buyers.And Thank you for reading.

  At 1st I have to clearly mention that it's not a battery monster phone, it takes more than 2.30 to 3 hrs for charging & lasts a full day  only on heavy to moderate usage. My previous phone VIVO U10 with 5000 Mah battery was lasting more than 1 & 1/2 day on heavy to moderate usage.  If you're looking for long lasting battery phones then go for some other brands than samsung, 3 hrs charging time is really irritating for guys like me.  On wet fingers its fingerprint unlock does not work properly as other brands fingerprint scanners work flawlessly.  Just 1 month after purchasing this phone, my touchscreen stopped working,  when I went to Samsung's authorized service centre, the engineers present there told me that it's a physical damage without checking the device.  & further told me that you have to pay 4,500 INR for new display as physical damage does not cover under warranty.  Signal receptions of both sim cards on this handset are weak. where on other devices like redmi, Vivo, I always get proper signals but on this device many times a day,  signal is totally lost & come, this is not expected from a brand like Samsung.  The major plus point of this device is only it's a non Chinese brand & its amoled display quality is way better than other rivals in this price segment. Camera is also another plus point of this handset. Both primary & secondary cameras capture better images. Though I didn't tested its camera at night.

  M21 is the best mobile under Rs. 15000/- budget. I have replaced M21 with my old J7, which is still running perfect. Now M21 is my third Samsung mobile purchased last week.I liked the most its DISPLY‚Ä¶M21 is a beautiful mobile phone with gorgeous big display with crispy & attractive icons supported by Super Amoled - Infinity U Cut Display, FHD+ Resolution (2340 x 1080), 404 ppi pixel density and 16M color support.Fast & Smooth PROCESSING‚Ä¶My wattamonster is running very fast & smoothly with powerful Samsung Exynos 9611,2.3GHz,1.7GHz Octa-Core processor for effortless multitasking. Which is best for both work and game lovers.48MP Main Camera & 20MP Selfie CAMERA which is perfect for me‚Ä¶M21 is perfect for me to click any memorable moments and video recording. My relatives & friends liked the most of my photos & video recently clicked by my new M21 supported by Ultra-High Resolution cameras.And its POWERFUL BATTERY that goes on and on‚Ä¶A massive power house with 6000 mAh battery which is more than enough for full day & night uses. On the full charging I have spoken about 35 min. continuously and after that I got to know that the charging percentage is still 100%. Which was very surprising for me and now believing that M21‚Äôs battery is really a power house. So guys don't wait... buy this wattamonster today only... Totally value for money...

  Talking first about the display, the screen has rounded curves at each end, and as I heard from many people too that  Samsung displays are premium type. I am really impressed. I was an iPhone user and never tried to move towards android and trust me this phone made me stick into it. The second major thing is the camera, the Camera clicks premium quality pics and I usually post these photos on my Instagram feed. The performance of the phone is fast and the battery lasts for more. I think i bought this phone 15 days back and still never saw 1% or 5% charging like iPhone battery. but I don't recommend for proper gaming because this phone lags a bit in that. Never Mind it is an all-rounder.

  Signal strength is not good occasionally some call drops observed.If camera and gaming done for just few time cost big battery drain.feel that it has 4000 mah battery instead of 6000 mah.Screen on time is just 6 hours 46 min.Moderate user also have to charge the phone at end of the full day (24hrs)Apps downloading from play store is really pathetic. It take 10-15 min for 1.7mb app when on high speed wifi of 50mbps and even on mobile data it takes too long time to download.Sony liv app of 22 mb takes 1 hour to download on high speed internet.Amoled screen is not that much good looking.Few bloatware that i can not uninstall.While playing pubg just after 30 min frame drops start increasing and phone starts heating and big battery drain found.Touch sensitivity is not working properly. I have to touch two or more time and also it is not same all over the screenI don't know why it isWide angle camera is not working properly when used against light.Even day light photos are not sharp.and colors are always more boosted than it is e.g. orange will become red , light green became dark green.For price cutting Samsung reduce its so much qulity...

  The Samsung  Galaxy M21 has a good performance and battery life is great and max than comparable to other phones in segments of other brands . The back camera  has 3 cameras setup with primary of 48MP and has wide angle . The front camera is also very good and is 20 MP . The fingerprint reader is also normal and not too fast . The best specifications  in Samsung M21 is the battery and it's super Amoled display. The gaming on this device is also good . So overall  it is worth to be considered to buy because rather than other brands , Samsung has the best service centers.  Also a lot of extra features are presented in Samsung when compared with other  phones in this price segment.

  This is my one month used review.-No hanging problem as usual we heard about samsung.-Battery life is perfect as we want..-Fingerprint sensor work smoothly-Slow motion in awesome compared to realme 6 and MI note 9 pro.-But here is one small problem- facelock sensor is working slow.-In camera clarity  is perfect and zooming power is also perfect.

"

  I bought the phone a week ago...the awesome features of the phone are the display and the battery....the battery life lasts more than a day...the camera quality is fine...the fingerprint reader is quick....but the face Id  some times doesn't recognise your face in darkness.....the processor is good for this price...the display is wonderful for this price .....the phone is definitely value for money....don't buy the phone for gaming....it's perfect for daily activities only.....

  Great features, everything a common phone user requires and much more.Good for gaming also, camera is very good, very impressed by wide angle lens the display quality is unmatched.Have been using for over a week now, no issues, great purchase.

  Samsung phones have introduced phones which are far better than many of the low cost phones or other companies. It's battery life and camera are good. OS is optimised and the phone does not bug us with unwanted softwares which generally come along. I got a good exchange for old phone. Delivery was on time. Absolutely worthy. Good service by Amazon.

"
"

  Battery does not seems 6k mah.I used it for 2 weeks with minimal app like what's app,you tube and g pay with minimal usage but battery  needs to recharged every alternative days.i have similar battery experience  when use 3500 mah battery life of other  product.i expect 3 days since I use  minimal use as I don't watch movies or gaming.also it's getting heat while charging.all other functionality is good.

"
"

  Product is well decent and the back plastic doesn't looks very cheap , well material used even it's plastic and very light and easy to handle SAmoled display is the main attraction here and it looks very clear and sharp and this s the only reason I chose M21 and the cameras as usual average and the battery life is really good and finger print sensor does the work well overall good value for money and nice to feel and this device is definitely not for the heavy Gamers ......... U can try this

  REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE MONSTROUS BATTERY OF SAMSUNG GALAXY M21.ANYONE SEARCHING FOR THE BEST BUDGET SMARTPHONE (NON-CHINESE) SO GO FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY M21 YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.(MY OPINION ) ABOUT SAMSUNG GALAXY M21:-- BATTERY = 5/5:-- DISPLAY = 5/5:-- DESIGN  =3.5/5:-- CAMERA =3.5/5:-- ONE UI =5/5:-- PROCESSOR = 3.8/5:-- FINGERPRINT SCANNER =3.5/5:-- SPEAKER = 3/5:-- ACCESSORIES =2/5LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST THIS SMARTPHONE IS NOT FOR GAMING.

"

  This phone is really awesome.Battery--The battery of this phone is huge as it easily run more than 1 and half day with heavy usage.Camera- Triple camera of this phone is great as it also have wide angle which helps in capturing wide angle picture and with Rich quality.Network-- Network reception is also good as my office is in basement still this phone gives full reception and no network problem.Display- Display is also great as expected from Samsung, full hd display and colors are crisp also.Processor-- As processor is also good as gaming experience is great and can play heavy games without any lag which is great.Speakers- One more thing I want to mention is that speaker volume and quality is great it produces rich sound and my place of working is very crowded however I can still hear this phone ringing loud and clear.Looks- The looks of this phone is also great as it feels premium in hand and doesn't feel like mid range phone.Value- This phone gives value for money as I bought it for 13499 only.The rating of this phone is 10 out of 10 go for it without hesitation and you won't regret it.Thanks Samsung for this lovely phone.üòä

  Galaxy M21 is an awesome mobile within 15k. I'm writing this review after using two weeks and to date, I haven't found any issues so far. The fingerprint sensor is good and fast. However, the battery life as mentioned in the feature as 6000 mAH is basically equivalent to 4000 mAh capacity, which is average battery life, it drains relatively fast than what is expected at 6000 mAH. Besides, it is not fast charging and it takes almost 3 hrs.to full charge. The sAmoled display is brilliant. The camera quality is not as good as 48 mp camera although 48 mp is more, but the actual output is not more than 12mp. A megapixel is a measure of resolution, the main factors for pure image quality are sensor quality, lens quality, camera firmware, etc. Daylight shots are good but night shots with low light are not good enough. Overall Samsung Galaxy M21 is a good mobile with a medium budget.

  1. Please buy a back cover along with this because the back will get really smudged with fingerprints because of its plastic nature2. 48 MP for the camera is just an inflated number, do not hold high expectations. It is a nice camera but it could have been much better.3. The fast charging isn't that fast. The first charge 30 to 100% took me an hour.4. Display is really good and is truly AMOLED.5. Samsung UI is good for the price.6. Be careful while inserting the SIM Card because the tray has a tight fit.Honestly this is the much hyped Samsung M30s just named as M21.  Overall, worthy of the price, 14k.

  Hi all, I was little hesitant to change the phone but later realized that this is a very good decision I have made, two days back up on battery, excellent camera smooth interface, cool samsung keyboard and apps, intelligent news on Screensaver, I miss only one thing is that screen recording feature. So I gave 4 stars overall and there is a room for improvement in everything.Go green phone for all users.

  It is a wrong thing to give a 15 watt charger and a 9 watt charger.I m very upset for this

"
"

  Purchased on 5 th July 2020 from Amazon,today morning touch is not working at all. Very bad phone . Don't buy. We bought three  phones of Samsung M21, which is out of order on 22.7.20 m31 and s20 ultra they are also not very impressive. I hope in few days they will also be out of order. Don't buy Samsung.any body from samsung can advise please.

  I have been using it for 3 months and here is my honest opinion about it.1. Display:- It has Amoled display, which is the best in terms of quality- great sharpness and vibrant colors- Has always on display- Saves Battery2. Camera:Front Camera 25MP- Takes good potraits.- Sharpness and color accuracy is good.Rear Camera- 48MP Main.- 8MP Ultra wide.- 5MP Depth.- Sharp and detailed photos.- Video Stabilization is good.- HDR Mode for better dynamic range.- Night mode is also Decent.3. Battery:- 6000mah high capacity battery- 15W Fast charging.- 15W Fast charger is included in the box itself.- After Heavy Usage, The Battery lasts through the whole day.- For average, Moderate usage it lasts almost one and an half days.4. Performance- Performance is decent- PUBG runs on 40fps smooth and extream- Gyro is decent,- Good for Casual Gaming5. Built quality and looks- Looks premium has nice glossy back- Feels Slim and lightweight despite having an huge 6000mah battery- Built quality is decent.- Has better drop resistance compared to glass back devices as it as polycarbonate in the back, and for scratches most people use it with the case on so it's not an problem.

  Hello there, here is the quick review of the Samsung Galaxy M21 4+64 GB version after 30 months of die hard usage.What makes it amazing:1.) This device is having FHD+ sAmoled Display and that is just outstanding means everything from saturation, contrast, sharpness, and viewing angles are just amazing.2.) It's battery is just monstrous, it's 6000 mAh battery gives you complete 2 days battery backup with easy to light usage even with hard usage means playing COD, PUBG and all games like them gives you 10hrs of Screen On Time.3.)48+8+5 MP triple rear camera and 20 MP front camera are outstanding at this much cost. Even it competes with higher midrange like Poco X2.4.) SAR value for this device is very less near about twice as less as compared with all Chinese brands.5.) Build quality is also great it is poly-carbonate at the back so don't forgot to buy a cover or skin.For me there is only one Cons with this device that is:It comes with 15 W charger and this takes near about 3 hours to charge the monstrous 6000 mAh battery.THANKS I HOPE YOUR DOUBTS GOT CLEAR WITH THIS REVIEW.

  Bought the 6Gb+128GB edition phone considering its made in India and wanted high RAM and storage. The reason being  I use multiple apps at a single time, and I need notifs simultaneously from different apps. The huge storage was a welcome change as I'm not able to store multiple games.The game booster works well with temperature management but it's better to switch off at some intense moments as it messes with gameplay.The display is spot on with OLED Screen. Colours can be viewed in vivid and normal brightness.Both the cameras were competent in its segment but Samsung could have done away with the software to 'beautify' the images from front camera automatically.One drawback I observed was the signal strength. When two Sims are inserted it is absolutely necessary to make the second slot 2G if you want good network on the first 4G sim. The sim even works better when the second slot is unused.Battery life is mega. Even with Bluetooth and location on, the phone lasts a whole day.  Charging is 15KW, not too fast but not too slow either considering the charge capacity of the phone.

  First...super amoled screen is really super.. wheather it is movie or youtube videos or seeing some camshots. No other phone in this price range has samoled screen.Remember we always see our phone's screen so it must be best and Samsung's Super Amoled screen has no match.Secondly... The monster battery , if you are a casual user with 5 to 6 ours screen time then M21 will last minimum one and half day . And if you are a heavy user then it will last at least a day i.e. 24 hours.Thirdly... Performance of both front and rear cameras are awesome. Pictures are clear and full with colour and have the right balance of colour contrast. And most important of all pictures looks real.Fourthly... Samsung UI is best among all the Android ..we already knew it so nothing to say here.Ram management is good and phone is smooth like butter even after opening 25 apps simultaneously.Lastly.. I have already installed more than 180 apps in M21 .. even now phone runs as smooth as when it was new .Buy it if your budget is under 15k . No other phone can match it's alround performance and Super Amoled ScreenIt's a BIG phone and amazing display.. it is bigger than iphone and has brighter display than  even iphone .

  Awesome mobile at this price tag,  finger printreader works well but not much as compared to china brands mobile.  6000mah Big battery so battery life will be longer  but don't expect more, 6000mah is just a big number. Fast charging need to be improve.  It's taking long time.  Anyway at this price this is the best quality solid mobile.

  Using this phone since last 2 weeks,Phone body build quality is plastic but good,Critical phone functions like Voice Call Clarity is better n clear in 2G/3G/4G VoLTE, ON/OFF is quick, switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa is good connectivity is stabledisplay crystal clear,performance is faster - download/app install is faster,no lags till now,battery is really more(2 days with normal usage on single full charge),charging also fast since its more so it may take a little more time to charge,Multiple Apps handling is nice,UI is also good,finger print sensor - unlocks fast,face unlock also good,Sound also betterBluetooth connectivity with BT headset is fastBack Camera & Front Camera captures great shots

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is undoubtedly the best phone to buy in this price segment.I feel this phone is way better than its other Chinese alternatives also.Features I liked about the phone:1.Full HD+ Amoled display of this phone is miles better than other phone at this price segment.Colours are punchy and blacks are deeper.2.The 6000 mAh battery easily lasts for more than 2 days for a normal user.3.OneUI is one of the best Android skins you can get.The user interface is friendly for one-handed use and also looks attractive.4.You get many useful OneUI features which are not available in stock android.5.The main 48 MP camera takes good detailed shots.Front 20 MP camera is also good.6.Fingerprint sensor is very responsive and fast too.7.It is made in India and is from a non-Chinese brand.Features I did not like:1.Plastic back attracts fingerprints, but the problem gets solved if you rock a case on it.2.Images taken on ultrawide lens appear a bit softer.That's it.I completely recommend this phone.Go for it guys.üëç

  I own a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and bought this Samsung Galaxy M21 for my wife. You know I was pleasantly surprised to see that all the apps of Note 8 including S Note are available in this phone. The battery life is decent and performance is nice. The photos taken by the camera are a bit saturated as per my observations but the wide angle camera is really great for taking photos of landscape and scenery. The selfie camera has similar performance with some low light performance comparable to the note series. My wife upgraded to this phone from a Chinese Series phone and she is actually liking the features and performance of this phone. She especially likes the display of it mostly in low light conditions where the stress on eyes is less.  6GB RAM, octacore processor and the 6000 MAH battery specs are quite legendary for a phone of this budget.

"
"

  Very nice device. The display quality & battery life is great. Camera is above average, not so good and not bad. Best mobile for normal usage. If you are looking for a non Chinese smartphone at this price point you can consider this product. Ofcourse you can play the games in this device but you are an extreme gamer you can go for another devices. But in the day to day life you can't see any problems. In my opinion it's a perfect device for me. My rating is 4.7/5

  Samsung M21 is an amazing piece of accessory to be on hand while roam around . As it described, it is a monster with respect to battery.. Stared using for a week and charged 3 times even though I use my office email as well. To get the full battery charged, it takes almost 3 hours ..The speed of the mobile /processor is excellent and no hanging.. Samsung Galaxy M21 smart phone has a Super AMOLED display which gives perfect viewing experience. The camera is with 48 MP and gives quality pics with many inbuilt options. Full screen option is amazing..I am not a gamer and hence no comment on the gaming experience but hope it will not disappoint you.At the end , I am sure ‚Ä¶ for a normal user, the options given at this price will make a smile on your face..

"
"

  If you want a premium phone at a reasonable price, just go for it.Come on man, you are getting a SUPER AMOLED display at approx. 12k. What else do you expect at this price range?But you got to ignore the outdated EXYNOS 9611 processor, the plastic chassis and last but nit the least the 15W charging, though both these have got not much relevance if you aren't a gamer like me.This phone does handle gaming nicely, but gets heated up easily upon gaming (that too high end like PUBG)Coming to battery performance it is fantastic. I watch a lot of videos (youtube, prime etc.) This phone display gives a next level experience.I get more than 24 hours backup. But full charging from 0 to 100 % takes 150 minutes (2.5 hrs) which may be a problem sometimes as at this budget you get realme 6i with 30W charging support (though they are giving 20W charger in box).Overall for working people and those who stream videos/ social networking it is an ideal phone. You will forget any shortfalls (which are negligible) with the super amoled display & the butter smooth UI.

"
"

  After 2 weeks of use, I would say the best smartphone in this price range even if you compare with any xiaomi or real me or oppo vivo etc. First of all Samsung's finishing is going top class now days and they are aceing it with every model.Great looks, slim and attractiveInterface is all synced up well with the phonebattery stand by is 2 days easy with no gaming useBest part is its not Chinese and so you've got the credibility and reliability.

"

  Amazing,Excellent but camera quality for video is not so attractive as I think when I am buying this.Android 10 and the most attractive as I like personal Samsung One UI 2.0 makes this phone more attractive.The fingerprint reader is very fast as unlocks the phone very fast.The battery life is too good as it runs 2 days without charge.It can take up to a 2-2.5 hrs to charge a battery from 0 to 100 as it is carried out by a fast charging by fast charger of 15 Watts.The gaming experience is also too  good in this phone compare to phones in this price range.Pubg also runs in high to medium settings,HDR.Pubg also runs in Ultra HD mode but lacks few times but in this range of phones it is like a flagship phone for gaming.Camera quality for photos is too good also i am sharing some pictures click by this phone but you have to compromise for video quality.Really this phone is eligible to grab the title ""Value for Money.#Wattamonster#Wattashot.

  Great camera,decent processor can compete with 730G snapdragon but above 720G . Overall great with this price range . At first I got literally confused with m31 and m21 because both are Ramesh and Suresh, the only difference lies in m31 is that it has macro lens and that I think which is not up to the mark and hence become a little pricey,but above that all the specs are same in both the phones ,one more thing to add that m31 has 64mp camera but the quality was also the same when I saw the 2 phones . Processor is also a mid range and it can compete with 730G snapdragon,I got 60fps while playing pubg in HD extreme mode. One this is surprising is that samsung released m21 after m31 . Don't know why but overall nice phone in this price range and I think it really gets an applaud for improving the camera and giving a faster processor.

  4 pros , 4 consPros1.battery life2.samsung ui with the  new focus mode and many other additions is cool3.brilliant amoled display with 403 ppi(other competitors offer lcd display at this price)4.fast fingerprint readerCons1. Time taken for full charging ( as it lasts full day , overnight charging is appropriate)2. Installed around 30 apps.. no heavy apps like pubg/ other games installed.. still there is a noticeable lag3.processor is bit old & we have been seein this exynos 9611 in many recent samsung mobiles4. Camera app gets stuck in between & takes time to load

"
"

  First of all, I consider this phone to be excellent value for money due to high storage capacity, battery, security functions, and lots of other features like Dolby atom, focus mode, smart view, themes, ultra data saving mode,etc.However, as far as I am concerned, the best thing about this phone is that it is easy to operate with smooth touch and functionality. Personally speaking, it suits my needs and listen to music with Dolby atom feature that is the most amazing experience.Another reason is that our family became fan of samsung brand, because not only mobile phones but also every electronic devices are superb. We are using mostly every available item of samsung brand and happy with those.And lastly thank you Amazon for making available this phone in least rate than market and other online sites.I must say that Amazon service is best because I got it before the delivery date and also the old phone pick service is very friendly.Thank you everyone who are involved in this process from manufacturing  to home delivery üòä

  I bought this mobile for my father and it worked exactly 10 days and giving network issues, sim not registered and network not found issues. There is some problem with Bluetooth also, it is not detecting any devices. As return window closed I took it to Samsung service center , I noticed lot of customers facing this kind of issues. Even if got repaired it Keeps on reoccurring, Worst purchase in my life, I made decision not to buy Samsung products anymore

"
"

  Has been using for 11 days.....short time period but have sufficient knowledge.....Has been using Redmi phones for long but decided to move away from Chinese products so turned toward Samsung....Had a limited budget of 15k......and got this phone for 12699, well within budget but without compromising onfeatures. In fact got more features that expected.Pros1. Amazing display2. Great Battery power - Very few phones have such large batteries of 6000 mah.3. Good performance owing to good processor and 4 GM RAM.4.  64 GM internal memory good enough for day to day use.5. Great camera - very good pics in low light as well. Video quality is also good - 4K.6. Separate slot for memory card in addition to dual sim slots.7. All required security options including face recognition.Cons1.May be a bit heavy than my previous phone but got used to it after 4-5 days of usage.Long term reliability however needs to be tested as this is a new phone, manufactured in March 2020. Asof now performing smoothly.Overall very good phone with features of a costly phones at such a low price point.

  Not a user friendly phone bought for my senior citizen relation. Wanted to return it but these days Amazon keeps making excuses not to take it back. The keyboard does not work properly. Better to buy from TataClick being Tatas they are known for integrity.

  Never regret.. Go ahead and buy it...üëçThe phone and features are great ..Even though its 6000 Mah battery. However u use can use whole day.It's a MONSTER :1.

  It was working for 20 days only. Suddenly the screen went black death, didn't turn on / charging. I have taken my phone to Samsung Authorized Customer Service center today, they told that the main board has to be replaced due to manufacturing defect.  I have to wait for another 3 weeks get it serviced since lockdown. :-(. Earlier i was using Lenovo K4 Note for past 4 years. I didn't face any issue in that mobile. After seeing lot of reviews I went for this phone unfortunately it worked only few days for me.

"
"

  The camera quality is simply superb, much better than some pricier phones. The battery is truly a monster, lasts 1.5 days very easily and the display also does justice. The only letdown is the UI, and Samsung's buisness policy of denying the Snapdragon processor in the Indian market in majority of its phones ( including 97k worth s20 ultra)

  It has been three Days of using Samsung Galaxy M21 4GBBefore Purchasing  like everyone I researched alot and compared with many other products and came to the conclusion  that I am not a hard core gaming fan so its perfect..I play but not alotLikes1. Battery life and Charging Speed2. Camera Quality3. Enough Space4. Instant working Speed5. User Friendly UI6. AffordableDislikes1. Polycarbonate Back2. Giving 4 to finger print reader ..coz I guess it was little slow.Overall I'm Satisfied and Happy.

  One of the best smartphones for me. The things which I like about this phone:1)Affordable HD+S amoled display.2) Corning Gorilla glass 3.3) Good camera many modes in it.4) Battery is Exelent.5) Loud speaker üîä is good too.6) Big screen.7) Recognizes face and finger print sensor is pretty fast.8) Flash light is super good can select the Level of brightness of the Flash light.9) Smooth display.Things I don't like about the product:1) Front camera üì∑ or Selfi camera is a bit warmer meaning you won't get the original color of the thing.2) Back cover may not be that strong.#reviewing after months of use.  Recommend phone.

  14 days of genuine reviewIn power mode downloading films become lagging. So do that in optimise mode.Fingerprint works well most of the time and is fast. Facelock didn't tried.I didn't tried any games yet.Watching Videos is good.Good display.Battery looks 4500maH battery..Becz of AmoLed display it consumes more powerFast charging is upto the mark considering 15W and 6000maH battery.Network reception is good.Speed goes upto 9.5mb/s while downloadingGood voice quality and call quality.Mono Speaker is good enough in price segment.Hotspot & Wifi working well.No battery drain issues so far.One of the biggest comedy is that its showing 1hr remaining battery when 4% is left.ü§£ü§£ü§£..Its impossible....screenshot attached.Camera quality is superb.Adding some of the stuffs here. Night mode is fine in the price segment.Maybe Superb....Video focus is bad.need software update.Of course Samsung brand is trustworthy Non Chinese smartphone to be considered.UI is good..user friendly. Love with finger gestures so that notification panel can be lowered using fingerprint scanner swiping.Samsung notes is fantastic.No ads compared to Mi phones as i was a redmi 4 user.Whatsapp notification doesn't show while watching videos..maybe its good..maybe not...for you...Need seperate app for network speed.One tap screen lock os not available in toggles section. So used accesiblity option seperate..Like quick ball.Back panel is fingerprint absorber.so order a screen protector and backcover.Overall 5/5

  Brought this phone on 14 May 2020, so after 3 months use, my review .Battery lasts one and half days with normal usage and charges in around 2hour 30 minutes.Looks good in hand.I even played call of duty mobile on this for 15 days and it's working fine.I got this cover from local shop.. it is of m31 but fits perfect.For facebook, twitter , youtube, netflix and all other social app users it is best phone.Also the Amoled screen is really good even the bad quality videos looks better in this.Camera is also nice. Photos look real and not painted like in oppo, realme etc. I get 15- 20 mb photos and even upto  35mb sometimesFingerprint censor is small, but works fine.

  Got my M21 6GB/128GB two days back.  Awesome phone.  Value for money.  Display is very good.  Touch screen awesome.  Camera also excellent, front and back.  Overall good buy.  Lots of preloaded apps are there.  The only thing I felt slightly bad is about the battery.  It does not feel like 6000 mah.  But don't know, let me use it for some more days.  Will come to know.  The charging cable is short.  Other wise a very good 15000 phone from Samsung.  Must go for it.

"
"

  Absolutely fantastic product! Loved it. The battery life is amazing and it charges 0-100% within 2 hours. Through continuous use the battery last full day which is great. I would say that camera is good but it didn't meet my expectations but I am not a camera person. Value is great. You can't find better product than this at this price. It has AR, AR Emoji, Night Mode, Super SloMo @240FPS.

  it is best smartphone available under 15k price range .i have been using this mobile since 1 month . till now i have  faced no hanging issues. all because exonsys 9611 proceesor is more than sufficient for daily usage.. i would like to mention here that i am hard core user who does a lot of multi tasking and uses heavy applicatoins.mine is a 4 gb 64 gb variant and till now i have faced no ram management issue as it has ufs2.1 storage.GAMING this phone is meant for gaming . i plays coverfire and asphalt 9 on high graphics and havent faced a glitch or stutter till now. can't say about pubg as i haven't played on this device yet.BATTERY it has a a massive 6000mah battery which can give about 1.5 day with heavy usage and atleast 2 days with normal usage. people complaining about charging speed should consider its battery size too.CAMERA is the thing that i loved the most in this phone. super slo mo offers 960fps. colors and details are great of main camera.UI user interface is smooth. one ui is the best ui available in th market til now . no other brands redmi, realme can offer this type of user interface.DISPLAY super amoled screen offers  one of the best viewing expirience. good viewing angles. this phone is made for media consumption.

  Good things about mobile:1. Camera is good2. Hotspot works fine3. Fingerprint reader is fast4. screen touch is smoothMajor issue:1. Mobile is not able to catch the wifi, other devices from same location are able to catch full wifi range[tested on many routers]2. wifi disconnects automatically.3. network disconnection issue that too during the on going call even if you are on terrace.4. battery discharges very fast.Samsung should fix these issues. There are so many issues for wifi and network connectivity. Not worthy as per price. Average performance product.

  The excellent AMOLED display (6.4 inches) of Galaxy gives a Full-HD+ resolution.6000 Mah Battery is worthy, Type-C port at the bottom and a 15W is also right. 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage give batter experience.One of my main attractions is the comfortable handle size. Features like dual-SIM, dual 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi, and four satellite navigation systems are beneficial. The 48-megapixel primary camera and good selfie camera shows unmatchable performance in this variant.

  Rejected all chinese phones, decided to go with samsung after4 years, M21 is a good phone in this price range; but not as much we expected.Most attractive factor of this phone is display. It is an excellent one.Phone's performance is good for a normal user. For a normal user Samsung Exynos 9611 processor is enough.In the case of battery backup, it performs only like a 4000mah battery and also it took 2 and a half hours for full charge.In day light 48MP back cam and 20MP selfie cam are good in quality. But in low light its quality is average.Overall it is the recommended smartphone to all the budget users.

  Good:--------Monster battery, Superb AMOLED screen, more than decent Camera, clear audio during phone callsNot so good:‚Äê--------------Charger length- very small, 2 feetTouch panel -not very crispNetwork/Wifi signal- not so strongMedia( songs) sound - loud but not so good without speaker/earphonePhone conversation - can be heard by others if put on high volume.Having said that there nothing that should stop one from buying this, don't want to compare with any chinese mobile here.

  Review after 3 months of using M21.Battery Life - Continues using of 24hrs with YouTube, Several calls, Social media etc etc. Then at night you will have 15% charge. Yes it is worthy as battery life.Camera - I found this average as other Samsung only, last I used J7pro. Few feature I like which is AI Emoji, Stability Camera etc.Sound - Good I like itFinger Sensor - Its not good when your hand is wet with water or sweat it will not work efficiently. But normally it's good.Face lock - it's good work fast

  1)First time ever purchased Samsung mobile and Selected M21 as per my requirement.2) Amazing snapshots with front and rear cameras.3) Great battery back up when I continously do internet browsing, hotspot  connections with Smart TV regularly watching Amazon originals,  Netflix webseries, hotstar,  Alt Balaji, YouTube videos etc , which gives back up 1 to 1.5 days. I have undergone  online departmental training for 15 days full office hours via MS Teams while lockdown having good video and audioquality without any head phones.4) It's handy. Easy to operate.5) Face unlock/ finger unlock process with a single mobile gives ease to operate.6) Sufficient storage of RAM 6 GB, internal128 GB which takes time to full of storage for me about 1 year which get rid of tension of uninstalling the previous apps and hanging problems.7) OTG supports gives comfort for officials work to transfer data from mobile to pendrive or vice versaDifficult to describe features in a few words. It's a  best product in the budget price..

  ¬†Highly Disappointed and frustrated. I got this delivered on Monday for my mother and all of a sudden its touch stopped working. In this pandemic when we are supposed to not go out, I called amazon as they are responsible for 15 days for the product but they are going to send the technician on Saturday that too after I refused to entertain the technician on Sunday and we ended up with Saturday. So I have two points to make :1. Either the amazon is picking packages in bulk and letting samsung give it a compromised productOr2. The Samsung has lost its name for being trust worthy. I think Real me and Xiaomi are much better. I purchased Samsung because of all this non-sense of Non-Chinese and all but I am realising my mistake now.

  I am going to share you my honest review. I am writing this after using this phone for 3 days. When you take the phone in your hand, it gives you the premium feeling of a 35-40k phone. The screen is better than any phone i have ever used. I bought this phone for my mother so the charging time didn't matter. It took 3 hrs to charge this phone but the battery life is awesome. you can plug the charger at night and then u can use it whole day. Camera is not as good as realme, redmi phones but as we know , we need to boycott chinese product so we need to compromise with few things. I have been using redmi note 5 pro for past 2 years and let me tell u M21 is much more faster than my redmi. so overall, i am very happy with this product.

  Likes~1. Camera Quality üì∑ is enormous.2 Battery Life is great. A monster battery life. I used 6hr online with a heavy app but only 32% consumed.3 In built features are a great advantage .4 Dolby audio is an even big bonus5 Display Screen is big enough and visibility is satisfying enough.6 Biometric locks are great at its performance.7 HD quality online streaming and video calls.8 It doesn't lag unlike other typical samsung phones.Things to improve1 I am not a gamer that why it suits me but for sure gaming performance shall be enhanced. Hope so a update would do so.2. If cover would be there it would have been great of you. It's screen is very sensitiveConclusion~ Overall a small budget but salient featured phone. Must buy at this price. Best phone under Rs 15000

  Pros1. The delivery was faster2. For the given features the phone is lighter as compared to other brands.3. I was worried about the back side since it's made up of plastic but it doesn't look so and is handy and smooth to handle.4. Screen is great. Gives a decent display.5. Highly smooth to use.Cons1. The camera is good but not exactly what's shown in details. It has lesser resolution than 48 or 20 MP. However I'm satisfied with the picture quality.2. The battery is good and the phone runs the entire day. But that's also not exactly 6000 mah. Performance is like 4500 or 5000 mah.3. There are some unnecessary apps which you can't uninstall.

  Brilliant display and battery life. But heating while charging, nicely heated,Now only 2 days of use my first charging. Lite in weight and it's very handy to use. For me only the heating issue.Now after 10 days of use : Normal heat only for last few minutes till 100 % full charge quite normal. Main thing is it's battery backup,get 2 days with normal social media and lot of calls uses.Camera is great and good clarity.but takes Little time .. Showing ""saving"" for each click.

  BATTERY - 5/5PERFORMANCE - 3.9/5DISPLAY - 5/5CAMERA - 5/5FINGERPRINT SENSOR - 5/5UI - 5/5#WattaMonsterSamsung Galaxy M21 is a real monster with sAMOLAD Display and a huge 6000 mah Battery to last all the day long and a 48 MP Triple Camera setup for better pictures. I am using M21 for 1 week, there are no issues. UI experience is very good. Battery is amazing, it lasts for 2-3 days in a single charge, but charging speed is not so fast as it comes with a 15 Watt Charger, it takes about 2 hrs 30 min to get fully charged from 0 - 100%, but that's not a issue. Camera is super, crystal clear pictures with thrilling broken shots. Performance is not so high as it is Exynos 9611 but it is ok at this price. PUBG can be played but not in high picture quality settings, so I don't recommend for PUBG. Fingerprint Sensor is very fast and accurate. Overall very good phone for normal users and can go for it

  After lot of research, i decided to buy M21. Phone was really nice for a month. After a month , a small black spot has come on the phone screen and it has spread to complete screen making screen not visible. Reached samsung service center when the black spot was small. They opened the phone and told me it is a problem with the phone display. I asked them to replace. They said the display will not come under warranty. I am not sure when the complete phone is under warranty for 1 year,  they can not replace the display with in 30 to 40 days of buying a product. Afterwards i asked them to replace for money. They said they do not have display part and I have to wait for a month. Problem here is that they are unable to say when the part will come to service center. I know samsung is a very good brand but if anyone goes through this kind of situation it will embarrassing. Now my phone is useless lying on the table. Who can help me now?

  THIS IS A MONSTER MOBILE FROM SAMSUNG INDIA. 6000 mAh BATTERY IS ENOUGH FOR 1-1.5 DAYS USE BASED ON YOUR USAGE. 48MP PRIMARY CAMERA IS VERY GOOD FOR CAPTURING PHOTO EVEN IN LOW LIGHT CONDITION. YOU CAN ALSO CAPTURE 4K VIDEO. SUPER STEADY MODE FOR 1080P VIDEO IS EVEN BETTER THAN OIS ON OTHER PHONES. 8MP ULTRA WIDE AND 5MP DEPTH CAMERA IS JUST AWESOME. sAMOLED FULL HD SCREEN IS VERY CRISPY FOR DISPLAY. SLOW MOTION VIDEO AND NIGHT MODE IS ALSO VERY GOOD. 20 MP FRONT CAMERA IS 2ND BEST IN THIS PRICE SEGMENT AFTER SAMSUNG M31. PROCESSOR AND RAM ARE VERY POWERFUL.

  This phone is really good looking from the front and if AMOLED display is what you want then you should by this device, I've watched movies and series which felt pretty good as dark seems to be really dark in it's display. I watched whole Peaky Blinders series and trust me it was a great experience for it's DOLBY ATMOS sound and AMOLED display, better than a IPS LCD display. About the camera, it doesn't really feel like 48 MP camera, my Nokia 6.1 plus has 16 MP which takes better sharp images. It hasn't been a month since I bought M21 and it already started lagging, I don't have much knowledge about EXYNOS 9611 but most of the people are complaining about it, and it might be the reason why the phone laggs. Battery stays well enough to use all day and next day also 6000 mah you know although high end games are not yet installed, I don't really like Samsung devices so I won't suggest you to buy this, but if you are only interested in Samsung devices then this phone is the best in this price range ‚Çπ10,000 - ‚Çπ15,000.

  I never use Samsung brand before my colleagues frnds are suggested me to take this item so I've decided to experience the new brand which I ever used before and I felt like Worthy item on this cost....battery life is awesome and fingerprint is very smooth and quality of the camera brilliant.....though there is some improvement required regarding the settings.......there is no app lock option inbuilt.....apart from that I am really satisfied with the product....just go through it.....and yes now I highly recommend to go with Samsung üëçü§ü.....and I am pretty much sure the brand customer service is also good if we face any issues further.....anyway thank you Samsung üòç and really thanks to most customer centric company AMAZON for safe, fast and secure delivery.....ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

  Many times most desired belonging doesn't need to push every single limit in terms of performance and utility aspects. If experience is delightful, makes you happy at the end of the day, it wins the race. Although this beast is packed with monster features, I would rather call it the most delightful all-rounder among all its competitors. Be it lightning processing speed, amazing apt camera quality, mindblowing sAmoled display, HULK battery, butter smooth One UI, rich DOLBY ATMOS sound, precise connectivity, everything is best in class, pure bliss !!!! Additionally, Samsung's Preloaded-app support is not kind of irritating, like it's Chinese competitors, instead it adds to smartphone's classy experience.  And most important observation, almost every sensor, part, and  software controller, carries ""Samsung's in-house product"" tag. This indicates brand's commendable research depth. Indeed, it is true manufacturing of a smartphone from Samsung, and not assembling parts and pieces, done by most other brands. I am a fan of Samsung again, nearly after 10 years, within a month of use of Galaxy M21 !!!!  Last Samsung I bought before almost 10 years, was not a smartphone, but a ""sliding quarty keyboard with touchscreen"" phone, as it was trendy then. I have always been a budget-gadget fan for Android smartphones thereafter, and never noticed Samsung smartphones fit in my pocket-friendly value-for-money definition, in last few years, and hence never bought one. Now since for the first time it did, I appreciate its Chinese competitors, who probably forced Samsung to bring its price tag down in Indian market, without compromising on brand's world class quality and reliability.  You don't necessarily need to buy a Samsung smartphone, if you are skeptical about its top notch quality and class. Samsung's top and consistent worldwide market share, throughout last decade speaks for itself. It's the only brand competing with trendsetter classy IPhone, non-stop for well over a decade till date. So to my opinion quality, robustness, reliability, class is not an argument, when you speak of Samsung. Buy it with your eyes closed, FULLSTOP !!!!  Now again if you are skeptical about price, everyone would agree that bestseller and pay-less-get-more are synonyms on Amazon. Chinese budget-gadgets have established this trend in last few years, and competing with them on budget aspect is not a joke. And believe me such competitive pricing is never before from Samsung, for the features and technology Galaxy M series is offering. So again I am nobody to comment on this topic, as most of Galaxy-M-series models are proud Amazon bestsellers, right beside their Chinese competitor models, see it for yourself.  To be frank, I don't want to get into extreme details about technicalities, hundreds of reviews can be found elaborating on this topic. All I'd like to recommend is, don't fool yourself, before trusting a single negative review based on one personal experience, and choosing some short-lived brand's gadget carrying almost similar price tag and features, do have a look at brand reputation over a time span, technological heights it has reached, wide range of technologies it offers, and overall user response, at least for an old trustworthy giant like Samsung.

  I bought the 6 GB, 128 GB version of this phone during the Amazon Prime Days time. I got a good deal along with exchange as well. I exchanged my Redmi Note 4 for this. It does totally worth buying it. The recent anti-china movement also enhanced my love for a non-Chinese product. Personally, I loved the product. the build quality is wonderful. The UI is awesome. There are lots of cool features like focus mode, Wind Down, etc. The camera too is good.Samsung M21 (Raven Black, 6gb ram, 128gb memory)1. Battery:- 5/5 Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5 Super AMOLED with full HD. Superb Display3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. No glass body, but who cares, after you put a back cover. In my opinion, don't spend more money on the glass body if you use back covers4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.5. OS&UI:- 5/5 Android 10 with One UI6. Fingerprint reader and face lock 3.5/5 Face lock and fingerprint reader are not so fast7. Processor and performance 4/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers. But for me, it's perfect as I am not a heavy gamer. No lag and hang till now. but the processor is outdated.8. Charging:2.5/5. No fast charging. Provided with a 15W charger and it takes about 3 Hrs to fully recharge the phone9. Accessories: 2/5 No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard. So order back cover and tempered glass when you placing an order as its back body is plastic and more prone to scratches. Verdict: For this price Its the best choice for a non-gamer.

  Wonderful phone in its price range. i got it under 10k with exchange. light weight, good camera, good battery.  Finger print scanner is good but acts weird at times.  People used to with bigger phones will have trouble searching for the finger print scanner. 64 GB phone is a bit overkill with apps with only 50 GB available for users.  128 GB would be a better choice for those who store lot of information.

  So, I bought this phone a week ago although my friends kept suggesting me to buy a redmi or realme, and they were not wrong because this is not the best phone in this price range. But due to my natural phobia for Chinese brands I decided to go with this. These are the things I have observed:-‚Ä¢ the physical appearance of this phone is ok. The body is complete plastic and attracts dust and fingerprints easily so back cover is necessary. The screen is protected by Corning gorilla glass but you might wanna use a tempered glass...‚Ä¢ the sound comes from a speaker placed under the screen while talking. So if you place the upper part of the screen near your ear and talk for large amount of time(like 45+ min), then your ears may hurt...‚Ä¢ 6gb of ram means you will have a seamless gaming experience. I'm not very much into games, but I play subway surfers and there were no issues, so I think it would be fine for other gamers as well. And there are no issues whatsoever with multitasking. You can use 5-6 apps at the same time without any kind of trouble...‚Ä¢the camera disappointed me a bit, to be honest. Don't get me wrong here, the camera is amazing at capturing colors and details but the selfie camera isn't particularly good inside closed room or in dense areas. Having said that, the live focus feature(available in both front and back camera) is something which you will find very interesting and photography is great in natural light and the camera is able to capture fine pictures in low light...‚Ä¢ 6000 mAh of battery means you will only need to charge your phone like once in a day(or maybe twice if you use it a lot). So, with 60% of battery you can use it for ~12 hours...‚Ä¢ Biometrics work fine, face recognition works good in low light, but isn't very good while your face or you as a whole is moving...‚Ä¢ there are many other features in this phone which I found quite interesting like the BLUE LIGHT FILTER - helps reduce eye strain; SAMSUNG MAX VPN - a boon for jio users like meüòâ; DOLBY ALMOS support - enhances voice quality over headphones; GAME LAUNCHER - keeps all of your games at one place and tracks your game time; FOCUS MODE - which disables most apps so that your phone does not distract you while studying or something; ALWAYS ON DISPLAY - shows the date and time and notifications when your phone is not in use and you can customize it to suit your preference; and Samsung's very own ULTRA DATA SAVING MODE which stops apps from using data in the background and could save you a considerable bit...(I am not quite sure if any or all of these features are present in other brands because I don't have much knowledge about other brands)Now, as for me, I never regretted buying this phone and I would recommend it to everyone who is thinking about buying it for whatever purpose. Look, you can get many phones from redmi, oppo, etc in the same range with much better specs, but I would not encourage you to buy any of those. This one's good...

  Not a good phone.in one fall..the screen broke..dont buy this phone.Samsung reduced their quality of product... screen damaged in one fall when i visited to service center, they are saying we will change screen along with touch while my touch was okay.I paid rs.5500 to repair the same. It 50% cost of total purchased value of mobile handset.I feel now I should buy Chinese phone instead of Samsung.

  If you are a normal person, who needs a phone for utility, like checking social media, do messaging, make calls, click some decent quality pictures, and want some decent battery life go for it.Points to remember while using it:1. Don't grant data permissions to Samsung while switching on the phone for the first time, read the title of the permission while grating it.2. Don't give access to Samsung store to download bloatware, it asks for permissions when used for the first time and if you grant access then it is very difficult to prevent that. Do keep this in mind ,else you will find a new app which you never demanded.3. Back of the phone is not glass or not even plastic ( we are used to), It looks good, but put a cover on the front screen as well as back panel. After applying tempered glass there is an option to increase the touch sensitivity to adjust for the losses due to the protection.4. This mobile heated up a bit when I queued over 50+ apps to download from the play store and was copying data from the previous mobile phone, keep in mind this is normal, even my previous mobile never in lifetime heated up, but during the transfer it heated a bit.5. Don't over expect from the phone, don't compare it to a 70k phone, it is a budget series phone and T to be honest well crafted. Its UI is smooth, apps run fast.6. Battery will last for more than 16-17 hours if you are a utility user, but i don't think so gaming will make up for the battery, remember budget phones outperform flagships in terms of battery most of the time, and this phone abides this statement.Don't run after really over expected specs, since it is not a flagship phone, for that we would have a need to pay 70k ( probably) , and you are searching the wrong range and category.And I had an MI phone before that, and THB it was annoying, I disabled and revoked permissions to more than 20 apps and services ( System ) in that to make that phone safe enough, until now Samsung at least has courtesy to ask for permissions and accesses.

  I bought the Blue, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.üòÄ

  First of all I want to say that its value for money. I have been using it since 4th september 2020. Let us talk about what positivities it has and what are the negativities.Display - Wow! The display is just awesome üëå like just a typical smartphone. Perform any video with a huge enjoyment and clarity.Camera- The 48mp has a powerful detailing capability. You can see above photos and zoom them out for the better experience. The one ui 2.1 has typical options such as live focus or super slow mo..but it is not able to click good photos without daylight, Nightmode is there though. Selfie camera is a bit yellowish. After the device getting one ui 2.1, it has single take option which gives you better enhancement. Wide angle is also pretty good. There should hav been a macro lens.Battery- #wattamonster is not such a monster in battery. As you see in high end devices 4000 mah works, in this phone, 6000mah works as same. It has not long battery back up capacity. Still its enough for the day to day use. The charging speed is pretty slow, while normal charging it takes almost 4 or more hours to get 0 to100% charge, in fast charging through 15w in box fast charger it take a bit less time. Still the battery capacity is not that bad for a normal user.Performance- The exynos 9611 gives you enough power to play any game on it. Though there is a bit lagging issue while playing pubg. But it won't hurt your experience any more. Switich from an app to another, there is a kind of frame drop or lagging issue which can be removed after rebooting the device or keep it aside for a couple of minutes or more.The fingerprint sensor is quite fast than other samsung devices.So these were almost all highlighted problems and performances. Except all are moderate and good. Every device has pros and cons but m21 won't hurt your feelings and yes it comes with the branding of Samsung so no worries.

  I choose m21 because of its larger battery capacity and lowest SAR value. It has SAR value of 0.468 W/kg while comparing to other mobiles m21 has the lowest SAR value. So it will not cause any health issues for a long time.It comes up with very high battery of 6000 mah lithiumion battery which withstands for a long time. Charging one time per day is enough for this. It supports fast charging of 15w and the adopter is included in the box.It comes up with powerful Octa-Core Exynos 9611 10nm processor. It comes with Mali-G72MP3 GPU for graphics. It is more than enough for normal range gaming. But for high range games like pubg it may took few milli seconds for loading and not as expected for high range gaming.It has 6.4-inch (2340 x 1080 pixels) Full HD Infinity-U Super AMOLED display with a peak brightness of 420nits. So you can experience high clarity of videos and graphics.The display also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.It has 20MP front camers ehich helps to take awesome selfies with great clarity. It also includes 48+8+5 rear facing camera which helps to take awesome shots. It also has the features like AR, slow motion capture and super slow motion capture. The clarity of the video is not so good in steady mode but in normal mode the clarity of the video is pretty. If the bugs was fixed during updation the clarity will enhance.It comes up with android 10 OS and one UI 2.0.It has three slots sim 1+ sim 2 + micro sd slot while most of the models comes with hybrid slot nowadays.It weighs of 188gms and the thickness is 8.9 mm which has a thin look. It has a very decent classy design with a plastic body.The most important thing is price. These amazing features are available for this cheap rate. I suggest you to buy this if you need a budget mobile with stunning features and amazing performance. It is more than enough for normal use so you can choose this blindly. If you need a mobile with a long life you may choose this ""Samsung M21""

  Good packaging, good budget phone.Box contains Mobile device, charger, user manual, sim ejector.Phone manufacturers should give at least basic level headphones.With few days of usagePros1. Class amoled screen, pictures and videos looks interesting.2. Good camera quality.3. Smith screen touch.Cons1. Gets heat up near the upper part of the screen from below the camera half of he screen.2. Battery being 6000 mah need to charge twice a day, not a good battery backup.3. Lags some time, response to the clicks half a second some time.

  This phone is awesome. Due to weather and humid condition the fingerprint reader never worked as expected and I've to use pin to unlock it. The camera and battery life is awesome. Being moderate user mine battery never gone below 25% after a day of usage. The wide angle and night camera is awesome. The only problem might be one's individual is this phone is quite big and heavy and I've to use both hands if need to use it for long duration. Need to uninstall and put on sleep lots of bloatware applications might be useful for others. I can get it whatever I want it from playstore. Rest the phone is very good and justify the price tag on every angle. If samsung has given glass back panel and wireless charging this phone will be equal to my S10 in all the comparisons.

  Not fully satisfied with this phone, battery is not upto the mark they only show it as a 6000mah but actually it is like 3500mah , it takes 4 hrs to charge 0-100%, full charging takes more time than Mi phones, camera quality is just good , fingerprint sensor not capturing as  fast as Mi smart phones samsung is using the name only 6000 mah but it is not actually .Overall phone is not satisfactory  just below  average major cause is battery performance and heating issue

  Review after using a phone for a week.- Call quality is good. I can hear clear voice without turning on speaker. 4/5- Display is ok. No complaint as such. 4/5- camera is ok.4/5- Battery is not great. Same performance if I compare with my 3500mA old phone!If you think 6000mA will last long, it's an illusion. 3/5Sensors are good. Working properly.My software in Motorola G5+ was better  than this android version.Good buy if you need a phone in 15k range and don't want to buy Xiomi phones.If you are a Motorola fan and considering Moto G8+, go for it.

  Its time to review my phone. Samsung Galaxy M21 (6GB RAM & 128GB Internal). Its around 3 months, I am using this Mobile.1. Fingerprint : From my point of view its good. Too much sensitive. May be as per the security issue, its good but some times irritating. So, depends upon user.2. Battery : Just super. Truly speaking, I am very happy. 24 * 7, I turn on my Internet. Also, Randomly use my phone for my study. But, Its almost survive 2 days after charging 100%.3. Camera Quality : No Problem, Still now. Actually I m not using camera too much and also I am not so concern. But I clicked few nature photograph, colour combination is quite good. Whenever I have used 48 mp camera, its almost 8mb picture size. Quality is too good.Speed : No issue, till now. Satisfactory.Display : Very good.Speaker : Satisfactory.After all this is Samsung. I have full faith.

  The Samsung galaxy m21 is a pretty good phone to buy. When you have a budget of 15000 rupees it has got everything that you may ask for. I further divided the performance of the phone into each section as follows:1.Display: The display consists of a super Amoled panel with punchier colours and better clarity with contrast. The touch response rate is very good and I liked the display very much.2.Cameras: The phone consists of a triple camera setup with a 48 mp main camera+ 8mp ultra wide+ 5mp depth sensor. The photos taken by the main camera has good natural colours with good clarity and an excellent dynamic range. The ultra wide camera takes  pretty good photos as well with a wider field of view. The portrait shots taken by the depth sensor turned out to be perfect with on point edge detection. The cameras have satisfied me very much. The front 20 megapixel camera also took very good selfies. The low-light performance was excellent and the video mode is made perfect with the super steady mode on.3.Battery: Battery is an area where the m21 stands out completely from the rest. The huge 6000mah battery easily last 2 days of screen on time and usage time. This has impressed me the most.4.Design: The design of the galaxy M21 is good as well. I opted for the raven black colour which is excellent. The Corning gorilla glass protection on the display ensures safety as well.5.Performance: There were no issues with performance as the phone comes with a samsung Exynos 9611 processor with is pretty fast and lag free. There was no problem with app opening times and ram management was excellent as well.6. Software: The one ui 2.0 with Android 10 on top pretty much does all the day to day tasks perfectly and is good for gaming as well.7. Miscellaneous: Other things such as call quality, speaker, face unlock all work perfectly.

  We get SAMSUNG brand name and it says on the box manufactured in India too. Great specs, budget-friendly, superb battery & display. So far extremely satisfied with SAMSUNG galaxy M21. Even if other smartphone vendors provide slightly better specs at this price point, I suggest going for Samsung smartphones for obvious reasons.

  Hello everyone I'm writing this review after 2 weeks of usage first thing first there is two main features in this mobile at the price of 14k1.FullHD sAmoled screen.2.6000mah batteryBoth are excellent as advertised. And there is big misconceptions about perfomance in this model because many tech youtubers specifically pointing Exynos 9611 as weaker chip yes if you compare this chip with it's competitors it will score low in benchmarks but when it comes day 2 day usage this phone doesn't make a sweat even in the gaming I played COD mobile in performed smoothly with medium graphics settings so if you're hesitating to buy this phone because of the processor go ahead buy it you'll never get disappointed.As far as cameras goes back camera is decent not excellent but it captures great picture but front camera needs some minor improvements.As software side oneUI 2.0 is well optimised in this phone I was surprised to see the RAM management in this phone it was excellent Samsung fixed there one of the major drawbacks in the past with OneUI .If you watched any YouTube videos about this phone you'll be noticed that this phone comes with the Feb security patches but when I bought this phone it was in July security patches so Samsung working on their software updates side of things very well atleast than Lenovo and moto. So at the if you want to buy a Non Chinese smartphone with decent specs with sAmoled screen I definitively suggest this one at 14k.

  I bought this Samsung Galaxy M21 over exchange of my moto G5 Plus. This phone is one of the best phone under 16k budget segment. Following features are the key highlights of this phone.Battery: Comes with a whopping 6000 mAh which gives you juice for almost 1.5 to 2 days.Display: When it comes to display, Samsung is best in the business. Support HDR content as  well. Since, screen is a sAmoled screen blacks are proper black which helps in saving battery also. Colours production is crisp and punchy. You can also apply screen on display since it is and sAmoled screen.Fingerprint Scanner: Fingerprint scanner is good and works almost every time.Camera: When it comes to camera it do a decent job under this price.Processor: Comes with Exynos 9611 which is based on 10 nm process. Gives an average performance with good power consumption.Digital Platform: Support  widevine L1 support. Thus, you can stream Amazon prime and Netflix content in HD. PFA screenshot.Design: Design is pretty good but the back is of plastic. Would appreciate if back panel was made up of glass.Would suggest if you want a phone with Samsung brand value, pretty good performance, decent camera and market leading display. Also, it is the only option available under non Chinese phones and do not show ads unlike other Chinese counterparts. So fellas, just go for it.

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant. The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer.

  I'm writing this review after using the phone for 60 hrs...At first I was quite unconfident about the battery life of the phone...but believe me!...It is indeed a monster in reality!Some key features of the phone which overwhelmed me a lot include the Selfie camera whose Output in natural light is just awesome! Then comes the triple camera setup whose outputs are attached...now decision is upto you! Till now battery is good and it's amusing that battery percentage doesn't come down from 100% for around 20 minutes of heavy use. Being a non-gamer, rather I am not focusing on the performance but I'm happy with the same.The screen is just mesmerizing with that high pixel density with sAmoled technology. Only one problem till now which I managed to point out is sometimes the scrolling gets freezed. But overall as a non-gamer I heavily recommend this phone!...Thanks to Samsung and Amazon.

  I'm reviewing my Samsung Galaxy M21 phone after 12 days usage & If someone tells me to say something about it in minimum words then I'll say """"It is Awesome"""". It is a perfect NON-CHINESE phone in budget phonesPros:1. It's huge 6000mah battery survives 36 to 40 hrs in normal usage.2. Super AMOLED display having very nice colour contrast and all.3. Camera, it's selfie camera having wide angle photo option & flash too and rear cameras also clicks very nice pictures, even in night both the cameras satisfies me and are very good in this price range.4. Latest Android 105. OneUI 2.0 support which having many enexpected features like you can use more than one apps simultaneously on single screen by minimising them, and we can generate a floating button for screenshot capture, screen off & many more functions, you can hide apps, and zipped apps for saving battery and many more.6. It's Exynos 9611 processor gives a smooth performance, no lag noticed in 15 days usage.7. And one of the major factor is that it is a Non-Chinese mobile.Cons:1. One thing I don't like in it is it's cheap Plastic body which is susceptible to scratches but you can manage with it by protecting it with a back cover.2. It takes approx. 3 hrs to fully charge.It completely good and satisfies me.

  I was quite excited while buying this smartphone as it was my first smartphone from Samsung and it didn't disappoint me.1. Amazing Display - when I turned on this device I was wowed looking at the display. Everytime I look at this display I fall in love with it. It's a pleasure to my eyes.2. Good network reception- I read many comments which said network reception is bad. But it started downloading apps at 4-5mbps.3. Very user friendly user interface- the best thing about this device is its UI. It is packed with small but very useful features that helps a lot.4. Good battery life - It takes around 1hr 45 minutes to charge from 20% to 80%. I am not a heavy user. With 1-2hr of music via bluetooth earphone, 1-2 hr of social networking, and around 5hrs of screen on time it goes a full day long still 20-30% remains.5. Decent Camera- the 48mp primary camera captures natural and crisp photos.The selfie camera also produces good quality photos.6. Call quality is very good. Till now I have not faced any problems.7. Processor is also good. Till now I have not faced any lag. It handles everything fine. Till now I have very smooth experience.8. Slow wifi connectivity- This is the only con I have noticed. First it kept disconnecting again and again. after restart connection never lost but I felt a little slower connection.So for a normal user it's a all-rounder within 14000.

  A good phone for the budget conscious, and a great non-China alternative... But, let's be honest, exyonos is trash. It's nowhere near Snapdragon, so don't expect to game on this phone... This is a phone for those who don't game, for those who just want a phone for social networking and media consumption... And in those fields, this phone surpasses their Chinese counterparts because of that super crisp amoled display... Never will you look again at a cheap LCD display on a cheap Chinese phone because let me tell you , Amoled changes the game... It's the best display on a phone you can ask for, and to get it at 14k, that's a great deal. Also, Samsung has inbuilt Dolby Atmos, so expect some crisp sounds as well. Camera is decent, but  the area around cameras do start to heat up when the camera is on for an extended time. Oneui is one of the best android skins out there, with almost no bloatware, but there can be a few hindrances because of the weak exyonos processor. Total rating: 3.5/5

  I like the way Samsung grabs the user's pulse.BATTERY : M21 is the best phone in this price range especially in terms of battery 6000mAh with 15W fast charging. Its huge. But its taking 2¬Ω hours for full charge.CAMERA : Camera quality is superb with 48MP main camera, 8MP wide angle shooter, 5MP depth sensor and with 4k recording and supports 480fps slow motion videos .In daylight, M21 shoots detailed and well-metered shots.WEIGHT : Weight of the phone is OK.DISPLAY : No need to tell about display. Samsung having the best display with sAMOLED type with gorilla glass 3 protection. And supports UHD streaming on popular OTT apps.PROCESSOR: TheExynos 9611 powering the phone is snappy and does feel adequate for light and moderate day-to-day usage.DESIGN: I certainly consider the well designed OneUI 2.0 software (Android 10) a massive advantage over other phones compared to Realme and Redmi.SECURITY : Fast biometric unlock.AUDIO : The audio output via the bottom-firing speaker is reasonably loud and the quality is decent.Finally at this price range you can go for this mobile.Camera - 5/5Battery - 5/5Display  - 5/5Fingerprint  - 4/5Processor - 4.5/5Design - 5/5

  We have been using for than 25 devices as we are into app development. This phone is the most delicate among all brands. For 25k you get cheap plastic which will get scratches even if you put it down on plane surfaces. The front screen also get easy scratches which is surprise. The night camera is not good, and Macro is just for name.The display and battery is top notch and thats it.

  Overall i am writing after one month use overall just okey products showing 5000mah bettry but its drain very fast like other Chinese phone and it have hang every time and big problem is network issue i have trying evry time struggle find network. Over all i didn't expect from Samsung to give this kind of quality. Very disappointed.

  1. Phone is absolutely brilliant especially when it comes to battery.2. Fingerprint sensor works good but need to be cleaned often (may be once in 3 days) as it doesn't recognize.3. Camera quality standsout however, selfie camera could have been better (Compared to my previous phone Huawei p20 lite).4. It's been close to 3months since I bought and phone freezed 3-4 times (was not sure what made it happen)5. For those who do not wish to use fingerprint sensor and prefer old school pin lock for home screen, the numbers are not large enough to move your fingers swiftly (considering the screensize)6. Sound quality is very well and videos plays absolutely amazing on the phone.7. Calculator app comes with preinstalled converters for all types of measurements making it quite handy.8. Fast charging takes around 2.5 to 3 hrs for a full charge.

  I order the phone on 11th Aug2020. It got delivered in 8 days.I plugged the phone for charge. After sometime when I checked the percentage of charge.The phone had switched off and it has been not been starting at all.I tried power button +volume down.Doesn't helpWorst experience with Samsung m21 till now.Also Amazon is not replacing the product with policy which says a technician would come and inspect the device and only then based on technician feedback they would provide replacement.I still don't understand.We believe we are getting the best price and experience from Amazon but in my case it's not and customer service and policy are time consuming process which needs to be streamlined

  All things are best but processor is somewhat slow.All area of mobile is best.Everything is outstanding.The box doesn't contain any back cover.You have to buy an additional back cover for your mobile's safety.Update (15/08/2020):Never give a chance to regret.. Go ahead...üëçThe Icons looks was not so great .. And then I set'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning üôÇ )..

  Average camera not that happy with both the cams (front and rear), fingerprint sensor works ok & battery life is good works 2days if u use limited internet on the phone... Charging takes hours to complete 100% becoz charging cable is not as good as it should be.. if you use different charging cable type-C of good quality it will work perfectly fine... Data copy from system to phone takes hours to complete again may be becoz of charging cable.No handsfree, No tempered glass and no back cover with the phone... Out of 64gb 15gb would be used by default system apps and storage...

This is within an acceptable range and it does not appear to be significantly affecting the overall rating for this product.Incentivized Reviewsf you‚Äôve looked through a lot of Amazon reviews you may have seen recurring phrases like ‚ÄúI have received this product for a discount in exchange for my honest review.‚Äù Sometimes these reviews will start by telling you this, sometimes they‚Äôll end with it and sometimes they‚Äôll sneak this sentence right in the middle of an unrelated paragraph. You might have also noticed that these reviews tend to be clustered; you‚Äôll see a number of reviews like this for one product, but then see none of these reviews for other products.

S  amsung has been toying around with the formula for a successful affordable smartphone lineup in India, the culmination of which is the M series. In general, Samsung focuses on three very important aspects that any affordable phone should have ‚Äì a big battery, a respectable display, and a set of decent cameras. All of this would‚Äôve been great just a couple of years back but today, even the affordable space is becoming feature rich. We are seeing high refresh rate displays, 64MP quad cameras, liquid cooling systems, high-performance chipsets, and more in a price tag of below Rs 16000The front of the phone has the Infinity U-style display with a waterdrop notch housing the selfie shooter. On the bottom, you will find the standard Type-C port, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a speaker grille. There are no extra buttons apart from the volume rocker and power buttons. A capacitive fingerprint sensor flanks the back of the phone along with a triple camera module that sits flush with the body negating any wobble when placed on a flat surface. The Galaxy M21 is also surprisingly lightweight even though it packs in a whopping 6,000mAh battery.Samsung manufactures most of the displays seen on smartphones of several OEMs and it comes in as little surprise that it reserves the best for its own devices. Whether it is an entry-level device or an ultra-premium flagship, Samsung is known to deliver a class-leading viewing experience. The M21‚Äôs 6.40-inch AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution conforms to the pattern. As expected, the colour accuracy of the M21‚Äôs screen is quite remarkable as are the contrast levels. The Galaxy M21 also happens to have Widevine L1 certification to watch streaming services‚Äô content in HD.When plenty of light is thrown at the main lens it will click respectable shots with good dynamic range and exposure handling. There is, of course, Samsung‚Äôs signature pumping up of colours in photos to make them look more contrasty, although at its price that is not a drawback. Detailing is respectable although the sensor has a hard time focusing on close-up objects. Since the Galaxy M21 uses pixel binning, standard photos are of 12MP resolution. A separate 3:4 48MP mode is present to take in more detailed photos but in general, there were not a lot of extra details present in the mode. As a matter of fact, the 48MP mode churned out slightly dull-looking photos in comparison.The presence of the depth sensor makes for good background separation while taking bokeh shots although that is all it is good for. The ultra-wide sensor does have a massive 123-degree field of view but it suffers from a lot of distortions on the edges. I was, however, impressed at how the lens managed to retail a lot of details and the correct colour temperature, something I see rarely at this price.Now I‚Äôm in no way saying that the M21 is a slow phone. In fact, the Geekbench scores on the M21 are comparable to both the Redmi Note 9 Pro and the Realme 6. However, it seems to me that there happens to be a much better integration of software and hardware on the Redmi and Realme devices as compared to the M21. For those who wish to play PUBG on a budget, the M21 will not disappoint you for the initial hour or so. You can keep the graphics at Smooth and also set the frame rate to Extreme for a much more enjoyable experience, but the device will start lagging after nearing the 60-minute mark. However, all casual games ran smoothly and without a hitch. For authentication purposes, there is a capacitive fingerprint sensor on the back which works well and is quite responsive.BatteryIt wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to say that the Galaxy M21 possibly offers the best battery life you could get on an affordable smartphone. The gigantic 6,000mAh powerhouse pushes through one day of usage easily and nears on completing two days before the battery gives up. Our standard battery test which involves running a video on loop with half brightness and volume saw the phone last nearly 30 hours. About an hour of PUBG Mobile drained the phone off just 12 percent battery which is quite phenomenal in my opinion. The only gripe is the 15W charging which takes more than 2 full hours to completely juice the phone up.

  I bought this phone at around Rs 12K. For this a big thanks to Amazon. After 2 weeks of usage, I am glad to share here my experiences about this phone. I would focus on pros rather than cons.‚òÜ Exynos 9611 processor provided is fast and well capable of handling basic apps. And switch between multiple apps is also smooth and seamless.‚òÜFingerprint scanner and face recognition are quick to unlock.‚òÜ16.21 cm (6.4'') sAMOLED display enhances your mood when you watch videos.‚òÜ6000 mAh battery is excellent. With normal usage, it serves you close to 2 days.‚òÜIn day light, 48 MP Triple Camera is good and manages to capture in details.At this price, i would say that i made the right choice and am very much satisfied. There are many reasons to rely on Samsung than any other brands. I would recommend this phone to all new buyers.

  Previously i bought m31 but returned due to slow charging and get m31s. Giving 1 day impression which i observed.1. Fast charging is amazing i.e. 60% per hour.2. Camera quality same as m31 with little added feature  includes single take shot.3. Knox Security - As i switched on phone at bottom it showed Secured by knox security but didnt got any secure folder may get in future update.4. Performance is same as m31.5. Battery backup is same as m31 and m30s.6. Physical overview is amazing feels premium and backpanel material is different and improved than m31 and only future will say the test of scratches.7. Side mounted Fingerprint runs fine, as i am left handed person didnt find any difficulty to deal with it.8. Speaker volume is much louder than previous M3 Series.

  After 10 days use,I think that It is the best phone under this budget. Just one problem,camera should have to improve by updating the system. Front camera sharpening is very bad.

"

  :::::::: UPDATED REVIEW::::::::The phone is just okay for the price. The camera is good-ish, the fingerprint sensor is a lot better (faster and more accurate) than my old Galaxy S8 and the display is really good!Things which I feel are a big let-down:1. BIGGEST CON: Frequent network issues (Samsung hasn‚Äôt fixed it and I‚Äôve installed the latest update released in late September)2. M21 does NOT support carrier aggregation (LTE+ or 4G+). Funny thing is that none of the M-series devices except M40 supports this feature, not even the pricey M51!3. Auto-brightness sensor is not well calibrated4. Battery capacity is good but the system is not well optimised which leads to higher battery drainIf you are looking for a good smartphone with good network connectivity and other great features buy Samsung A-series mid-range and above phones. Do NOT waste money on M-series phones.

  Now I am going to tell you a detailed review .I bought the 4+64 GB variant and the delivery was too fast. The delivery boy obviously did not follow social distancing  and we had to tell him to leave the product at the door. The packaging was decent and there was not even a scratch anywhere. The screen can be bright for indoors but it a bit difficult to read the screen outdoors.The camera quality is decent.48 MP camera comes with great detail.The battery is outstanding.It takes 1.50 sec for the phone to charge the phone 1% so it takes about 2.50 hours to reach 100%.The on screen time for 1% of battery is nearly 5 to 8 mins while watching videos .So you can expect a huge battery backup.Yes the processor is a bit slow but to those who want to know if you can play pubg on the phone smoothly  or  not then the answer is yes. Run the game at smooth +extreme graphics and your game experience will be very good.But if you are a heavy gamer I reccomend realme 6 since its helio g90t is best for gaming.But if you are a casual gamer like me then m21 is best for you.The amoled screen is so good that your movie viewing experience will be great.But yes there's a little heating problem.Overall the phone is very good and I recommend it.

  I am writing this review after using this phone for more than a month.1. Camera - It has a really cool camera and I loved using this camera2. Battery - Ok type. It is 6000. It lasts like 1.5 day after regular usage like youtube, surfing etc3. Body - Cool looks, doesn't feel heavy4. Fingerprint- Good5. Screen - It's really cool. I feel good while even binge watching showsOverallI like this phone very much, it has a sense of belonging to the user, and it really gets almost everything done. You will be happy after buying it. I want to give it 8/10Nore: I am regular user without heavy gaming like pubg or free fire.

  Am a new one for samsung mobile.I used more than 1 month.Pros1. Handy and good to hold not slippery2. The monster battery, for me nearly 2 days to use the entire battery as a moderate usage3. Cameras are awesome, especially the slow motion and super slow motion. 48MP give a clear view of each and every minute things in pic4. Refresh rate is also good, I used more than five app I switch over simultaneously, there is no lag.5. This sAMOLED screen give u a better picture for you6. Screenlock with finger print on backside and face recognition is simply awesome,it required less than a second to unlock7. Sound quality is also goodCons1. 15 w Charger is a big problem for this monster battery may be it will be 25W charger is perfect for it2. Back case is plastic if it is a glass it will be more premium.

  This is the best value for money smartphone under 15k. I got the delivery one day before the estimated date. The packaging by Amazon is really good. I am trying to figure out my experience after 1 week of use.1] It's display :- The word 'Super Amoled' speaks every thing. The best display I have ever experienced. It has 6.4"" Super Amoled display which gives me a flagship experience.2] Camera :- I am totally impressed with camera it has the best portrait mode. The wide range is the widest in this segment. Selfie shot is excellent with good details.This Smartphone shoots best quality video with fabulous details and has very effective EIS stabilization (I have shakey hands but I can capture it very much shake free).3] Battery :- Again the number ""6000 mAh"" speaks every thing. I can easily able to use it for 2 days with normal usage.4] UI :- I am in love with the Samsung's One UI 2.0 because of smooth experience.It is far better than MiUI, Realme UI and any other UI.I have not done gaming but will update later after two months.Overall I will recommend you go for it the best phone.

  This is a great budget smartphone, everything that it claims - good camera, performance, sensors, fingerprint reader.Triple cameras work best to the description. One star less because, fast charging could have been improved (though it is still amazing) and the battery optimization could've been better as it does not seem to be a 6000mah. Still battery is good enough for more than a day though. Overall a satisfied purchase.

  Samsung M21 is a fantastic phone which gives best value for money and almost all features that one can find in high end phones.Phone features:Built in call recording and Auto recording.Read aloud callers name, hide apps,Biometric security feature findmymobile given by Samsung.Gesture  recognition for finger print and screenshot.Dual messenger for 2 social media accounts, Open as popup window, side key setting for Power button, default enabled Video calling, wifi calling, change ouch sensitivity, customizable clock style display, one handed mode.Allows to slow and super motion videos.It gives Mcafee Antivirus too.Good finishing.Camera: Very good camera and wide angle lense. 48MP main camera, Bokeh effect using live focus,  20MP selfie, Camera has image stabilization, allowed you to shoot 4K videos in both front and rear cameras, full fledged AR support doodle and emojis. Camera has good saturation. It's an upgrade to M30s. Night camera photos could have been better... M31 gives better night photos.Sound: Dolby atmos option and sound equalizer. Sound profile is not best, compared to HTC or Apple.It's a steal for having high speed octane core processor with 6 GB +128 GB memory. Good contrast in the Super Amoled full HD display.Fast charging, huge battery 6000.Light weight even though it has a large battery.Much better user experience than RedMi or Realme. Very ergonomic. In sunlight it may not give best contrast, but great for indoor use. For very heavy graphics usage like playing PUBG or like games.. it can show occasional lag. It comes loaded with some bloatware, but far far less than other phones.A lot of Samsung software is preloaded is provided like My Galaxy, Samsung notes, Samsung Max etc along with other preloaded softwares.Verdict: Its the best mid range phone loaded with features and great camera and large battery and best value for money.

  This phone is a great product and I really suggest it because it holds budget and provide  all common features.the most important thing is the battery...6000mah battery is the highest leading battery in these kinds of phones..the samoled display makes it more great.48 mp camera holds more features like super slowmotion,etc.20mp front camera is also excellant...the one ui2.0 is superb and the only thing that I am sad is it doesn't have an inbuilt screenrecorder...

Sumsung galaxy also best app for use media no need to install MX player like extra media playeronly tha negative thing is blotware. It's also have space eating useless unremovable apps like Chinese Phones

  It's one of the best phones out there in this price range. The best thing that Samsung offers here is a 6000Mah battery with fast charging option (though it supports 15W) with a clean UI, loaded with Android 10 out of the box. It has a triple camera setup where the main camera is a 48MP sensor. You can run almost any game without any lag issues. The Exynos 9611 chipset performance is quite impressive. You'll hardly find any lag issues while using multiple apps as well, thanks to the UFS 2.1 storage. Sound quality on the speakers and on headphones is amazing. On headphones, you get the option to use Dolby Atmos for enriched sound experience. It also supports Dual VoLTE and the call clarity is amazing. Besides, one amazing calling feature that I found on this phone is the Wi-Fi Calling. I don't know if there's any other phone that offers it but at least this phone does and it's amazing. The notch is a bit old looking but the display is the best out there is in this smartphone category. In my knowledge, no other phone offers an OLED display in this range, other than Samsung. If you're worried about spywares and third party apps that other phones have pre-installed and keep showing pop-ups or notifications all the time, then don't be because despite not having the Stock Android on the phone, the Samsung One UI offers Stock Android like experience. In fact, I actually find it better than the stock version. If you can afford this phone, I'd suggest go for it. It's worth the price.

  Overall a good phone, however the product compared to Chinese phones such as redmi, realme, etc.  is way off the mark, comparing the price range. Samsung needs to do a lot  to gain the lost market. I would have Samsung Redmi had it not been the recent brawl with China. Even the sticker on the back of the phone is not properly aligned

"
"

  Poor after sales service. One blue batches is noticed after 3months of only in home use. But when I produced it to service center they take the mobile and after 1and 1/2 hour they told me this has been made for water damage. But truly I say to all of you water issue is impossible as this phone was used only in my room. And same issue I have noticed with near about 5 other person who came to repair their mobile within warranty. And they ask me 6500/- to repair it. Think visit any service center then you may proceed for buy at your own risk.

  I have been using M21 from the last one month. Apart from minor cons, overall I am satisfied with the product.Pros:Nice and beautiful display of super-amoled, Good camera with HDR, AR features, wide angle is also good, battery back up is ok (with 6000 mAh, some may expect more !!), a better thing to say is that charge doesn't drain much on standby condition, Processor is fast for a medium type of user, within m-series this is one of the best product with less price tag.Cons:feels like camera has some minor spherical distortion in normal mode also, selfie wide angle is very distorting, battery needs a charging time of 2.5 hrs which is just ok for the large battery, battery back up is around 1 day and 12 hr for limited usage, with extreme usage a back up of around 1 day is experienced, sometimes processor seems a bit laggy with more apps on background (even though not noticeable much), in-built apps from Samsung  are little messy but some extra supporting features makes it good.Overall the phone is good contender at this price segment.

  I really amazed why Samsung's phone sells via Amazon, a cart made to sell garbage as goodies  Amazon ,nor Samsung company none of them don't care about the status of the customer  they make us foolishly happyI have no idea why ? this phone sold for ‚Çπ16,000 /_ in shops ,for  ‚Çπ14000 as per OFFER  on line , this phone is a frying pan gets heated if it used ,I brought in EMI if I  return  I face 3000rs loss as processing +canceling charges etc , so I require go to service centre  with loss of pay 2 days ‚Çπ2000 , +home to service centre  transportation  etc, please don't buy it in this Amazon store, my kind request for people is buy only in store  ,if u face any issue the store keeper will help in all the way to get  a new phone  within 2_3 days of purchase  shops open till 9PM  ,but the service centre  didn't. Even the authorities of service centre will help in all the way to get new one .,but if the product is on line purchase  they guide u to make it on our own  by the way I am the loser ,still burns my fingers  when ever I touch the phone  better. Understand  my way.

  Amidst all these pandemic situations amazon managed to bring the package before expected date.The service from the seller was good.Actually the phone looked quite premium.I wasn't expecting that.The performance seemed good after ramming around for sometime with some apps.multitasking seemed flowless.Eventhough the wide mode and standard camera are actually good,I expected a better camera.On the pro mode,It could have been better.The back of the phone gathers a lot of fingerprints.Pros:1.Awesome looks.2.Good performance.3.Easy to handleCons:1.Average camera

"
"

  the performance is adequate for the price, should've gone with a snapdragon processor at least to take advantage of the 6000mah battery, Exynos is not power efficient, camera is good in good lighting conditions on dark days it might be a lot noisy, ultrawide is okay, nothing to boast about. I would suggest this phone to people looking to get two days' worth of battery out of a single charge. If you are looking for performance better look elsewhere.

  Excellent mobile with huge battery, nice camera quality and awsome look..Prose-1. Battery: I choose this mobile mainly because of its battery.6000mah is huge for all your works. Once I fully charged this and used frequently the whole day and after 24 hours 50% battery still remaining.2.Camera: I heard about samsung camera quality but experienced in my own..48 mp camera really amazing for photography and front camera is also very good.3. Look and design: I choose midnight blue which look really great. 6.4 inch huge screen is sufficient for watching video or browsing.Cons-1. Charging: took longer time for charging thogh fast charging shown. I think this because of battery capacity. Took 2 hour for charging 40 to 100% charging and phone becomes little hot while charging2.Heavier: I think because of battery the phone is heavier..if u lying bed and holding it in ur hand for a while..there will be pain in hand3. Front camera position captures some spaces of screen so a little bit disturbing while  watching videoOverall nice mobile in this price and i am very much satisfied.

  I got the 6GB, 128 GB version and have been very happy with my purchase. The face reader takes time but the finger print reader is spot on. The screen clarity is spot on and can read in bright sunlight without issues. The digital wellness is also well taken care with various options built into the software. Another good feature on the UI is the ability to turn down notifications to absolutely necessary apps, which is a big welcome. I am able to use one hand for  for navigation which is exceptional for a screen this size. Overall a good purchase very satisfied.

"
"

  First of all  I would like to thank Amazon to deliver this product  earlier than delivery date.About  pro:- (1) camera in day lite condition was great (below 15k range,better than redmi note 9 pro) but in low light it needs to be improved.(2) Battery is awesome .It provides approximately 1.5days in normal use.(3) Display  is awesome because it comes with super amoled panel , hence no other phone can beat in terms of quality below 15 I.Cons(1) Charging is not great because it has 6000 monster battery  however it comes with only 15 watt Charger.Atleast it should have  provided 25 w Charging support.(2) Processer is ok but not compare with snapdragon720 g or mediatek g 90 t but for everyday use it can handle all day activities except playing heavy games like pubg , asphalt 8 etc.(3) Build quality  needs to be improved  .Its back panel  get scratches easily if you do not use back cover.

"
"

  The combination of the components are the best.The 6.4"" super amoled display with a 1080 x 2340 resolution is so good and best that anyone can ask for.The refresh rate is 60Hz and that's what we get in this budget.The processor is Exynos 9611 which performs well than its equivalent Snapdragon rival.So,worth buying.The RAM and processor combo gives us the best we can get.The 48 MP, 8MP,5MP rear and 20 MP front Cameras give us the power to capture perfect quality pictures even if we are not an pro in photography.The additional pro's are that it have 15W inbox fast charger and can support 24W fast charging and Type -C charger cable.The 6000maH battery is  long lasting and very much good for gamers who can play an whole day with just single charge.The fingerprint and face detection sensor are pretty good and it additionally have a 3.5mm jack which is not present in most of the modern phone's.It is a best choice in this budget and can be considered if you are looking for a best phone to stick on to for year's.

  I have received Samsung M21 phone. But the touch is not working. I did reboot 4 times. Same issue still persisting.I have spent Rs. 14000/- looking at Samsung brand. It is not worthy phone. When I press 1 it is typing 0 t for zEven I could not type my email id in the Playstore. I could not press wifi option also. I tried for 4 hours and very much disappointed with phone. I called your service person through Amazon webapp.Service person (over phone) gave few tips and still phone is not working. Amazon is having verygood expertise .I have requested to replace the item as basically touch itself is not working, sowhere does the remaining functionalities.Atlast, with somuch kind and mercy at me, Amazon sending Oexpert for the Samsung M21 phone . I have to wait and watch only .

  Really happy when I am reviewing about my new Samsung Galaxy M21 as it became a boon for me since I bought this through Amazon online shopping.I am not using laptop for watching movies,reading and accessing social media etc as I got this phone. The reason is that the color reproductions and vivid mode is fabulous than any other display at the same price range. Thanks to Amoled display.Almost got 12 hours of nonstop video streaming with this device, 6000 mah really helps. It also has a feature for online video streaming which enables HDR videos in youtube,amazon prime and Netflix. Also enabled HDR in gamingWith respect to camera,wide angle lens is just amazing. 48 mp mode takes little bit more time to capture but it's not too laggy. Final result of the photos are comparatively superb as compared to the other brands. Selfies are pretty good as 20 mp front camera is really fantastic.Overall, Samsung Galaxy M21 is really a good product from Samsung which I can blindly suggest you to buy without any hesitation.

  Brought it at Rs 13999/- with a amazon discount Rs500/- only. Ordered on 9th August'20, but received on 22nd August'20. Amazon is not OK with its delivery system till now after lockdown I suppose.But the packaging was too good with safety and security.The product is good as per brand Samsung. But not up to the mark. It is because camera is not good in low light photography. Sound is good. Display and touch found good in my few days uses. But the same quality is available with other brand like MI with less price. Samsung can't able to give any thing better quality with such additional cost. Not a headphones included in the box.Moreover Amazon not also giving extra facility to its customers. Not in form of discount or as benefit. Its better to buy from shops instead of amazon. Very delaied delivery and no benefit.

  I am writing this review after using for 4 days. Here is my thoughts and opinions.1. Looks and Feel: 4/5. The phone looks like a premium phone when unpacked and feels comfortable in hand for a standard adult. The back panel however is plastic and is a fingerprint magnet. Not satisfied with the back panel.2. Fingerprint Sensor: 5/5. Its fast. Really fast and accurate. You can configure it to open apps using 3rd party apps.3. Screen: 5/5. AMOLED screen is awesome. And color reproduction details of 1080p YouTube are lovely to an average user. Samsung says that its Gorilla Glass 3. However the current industry standard is Gorilla Glass 5. At this price range, Samsung should have gone with ver 5.0 intead of using the old ver 3.0.4. Battery: 4/5. Although Samsung says that its 6000mAh, you wont sense that its 6000. It looks and feels like somewhat around 5000mAh. Battery drains from 100% to 20% at the end of the day with data off when not in use. If you are a gamer then you will have to recharge the phone once every 4-5 hours of gaming. But for an average user, this phone has sufficient power to last through the whole day without needing to go to the charger. The charger supplied is a 15 Watt adapter with a USB Type C data cable. And it charges the phone slow. Charging 6000 mAh should take time, but this charger takes around 3.5-4 hours for a 100% charge.5. Processor: 4/5. Samsung uses Exynos 96112.3Ghz Octa-core processor for this model. Its comparable to Snapdragon 660. Processor performs well while running games and editing photos.  Heavy gamers should however prefer to go to MediaTek's G series or Snapdragon 700 and 800 series processor phones to play at max game setting and configurations. Multitasking is smooth and fast. However, there is a noticeable delay and slowness when installing new apps and also after taking a 1 minute video in highest resolution. It feels as if an extra 5 seconds are needed while installing a new app and saving the video. Overall in the end, combined with 6 GB Ram, the processor a potent performance combination for all types of users.6. Camera: 1.5/5. Very poor quality photos captured by a phone of 48 MP camera. It feels like 13 MP camera. The front camera also captures poor quality photos. Zoom is not supported. Close-up macro shots are horrible. If you are a photographer and love taking photos and camera is the top priority, then this phone is not for you. Camera software is also very poor. Since I rarely take photos and am interested only in gaming, so I am satisfied.7. Connectivity: 5/5. No issues with connectivity. I am having 50 ms ping while playing and excellent call quality.No issues here whatsoever.8. Software: 3/5. Samsung is known for installing tons of bloatware in all their phones and this model is no exception. Had to spend close to 45 minutes to uninstall/disable all the unnecessary bloatware. OneUI 2.0 is actually good. Its smooth and offers smooth usage.Final thoughts: If performance and battery is your priority, this phone will satisfy you and your requirements. Better buy this phone instead of Chinese phones.However is photography and photos are a priority, then this phone should be at the bottom of your list.Headphone is not included. You need to purchase it separately. Also buy a screen guard and a back cover. Phone heats up while playing online games. However the main reason is that the current room temperature is close to 40-42 degree Celsius. Heating should not be a problem for most users.

  Excellent mobile with full fledged features.huge battety.a good quality mobile from Samsung.only thing is little bit costlier than its peers.camera is good,not excellent.biometric facility is so good.colourful mobile with plenty of features like smart through which we can see our mobile screen contents directly on smart tv/laptop

"
"

  Very bad product. This was my 4th Samsung device purchased but did not find worth the money. Within a month of purchase the adapter stopped working. Camera has a bug and picture at times goes black after clicking. Battery does not last long as it says in features and charging time is too long considering the ""fast charging"" option. Fingerprint sensor is just OK...

"
"

  Well I'd say it's not that much extreme level mobile at this price point. But on the other hand it's far better than other devices.If I talk about individualCamera: Picture quality is good but there's scope of improvement. We can expect little better at this price range. Like night shots need improvement, color combination(Exposure and Saturation) can be better.Live focus(portrait) is the plus point and it provides good quality.Battery: Battery life is good but if you expecting a 2 days battery life then you won't get it at all as it provides sAmoled display (honestly no one provides that with this resolution). So 6000 mah is enough for 1 to 1.5 day run with work.Not even 1 day if you using mobile internet and sharing it via hotspot.Performance: Don't expect snapdragon level performance at all. But it is good for daily usage. Sometimes you will notice lags or freezes but that's 1 in 500 or 1000 times. Doesn't matters really.Sound: Sound is ok. Not too loud not too low. Dolby system is good enough to give you the feel like multiplex.I'll recommend you this phone if you're not a hardcore gamer.

"

  Everything is awesome. The phone hasn't lagged yet and I'm extremely pleased with it. The camera is awesome but can be further improved. The autofocus option is not available and you can't zoom in and out while taking selfies, even though the picture quality is excellent. The OS is very smooth, no ads at all, but I would recommend Samsung to delete some bloatwares such as helo app and snapchat. Because not everyone is likely to use them.  The phone is easy to handle, fingerprint unlock is fast as well as face unlock. But Samsung needs to work on the back panel. Dear Samsung, even if you guys print the Samsung logo in bright prisma white colour the phone will look attractive. It is just a mere suggestion. But you all are experts and you know perfection has no limits. M21 is better than realme, redmi, oppo phones because there are no unnecessary ads! I'm not a gamer, and this phone suits me. And I guess free fire will work smoothly on this mobile, but for heavy games like pubg you can opt for realme. Rating from my side 4.5 out of 5. Thank you!

"

  Great phone for the price. I don't game or do heavy multi tasking, so this is great for everyday use. Owned a Redmi Note 4 before, and I went for this because I was bored of Xiaomi phones. The software is really good, although just feels a bit less smooth than MIUI. I wished, though, that at least Samsung didn't do the shady advertising stuff on its budget/midrange offerings but this seems to be the staple in this price range for all manufacturers. It can if course be disabled, if you know the settings. Other than that, the battery life is great, cameras are okay. They don't matter much to me though. The best part however, is the AMOLED screen. It's seriously awesome and just gives you a great experience of using the phone.

"
"

  This  review is after 15 days  of use.Pros:Best phone in this  price range.Camera is goodLong battery life. More than 12 hrs with continuous gaming and internet usage.Graphics is ok for regular games.Display is nice and crispCons:GPU lags while loading high graphic intensive games.While running few apps and games the front camera drop and curved edges obstruct full display.Phone is a bit heavy may be due to 6000mah battery.Opinion:If you are not a heavy gamer, Use phone throughout the without charging, you can go for this phone.The price may be a bit higher compared to similar budget phones but acceptable due to the reliability of Samsung brand.

"
"

  I won't recommend this Samsung phone. I've used this for almost 2 weeks and found alot of problems.It hangs almost everytime. Opening a application or opening camara. Camara is good but not a quality of 48mp I think. The battery life is good I think. 6000mhz should be enough for all day Video watching...but It takes almost 3 hours for full charging. Display is Good. The media sound volume is very low, there is only one speak below right side...so you might block sound while holding phone in your hand. Earphone or Headphones is preferred for media Sound. Finger printreader is a little bit slow...it takes atleast 1.5-2 seconds for unlock in my case.I bought this for Rs.14000, just because I don't want to buy a Chinese phone. I go for Samsung this time... but a little bit of disappointment from Samsung.

"
"

  Mobile over all is tremendous.  Even in 14000,Battery life-Less than expected but if you are a mid-user, then it will give you a running time of about 30 hours, but the charging time takes 4 hours or more.Camera guilty-Struggling little in low light.  But the camera works very well in daylight,Performance & UI -5* It is much better than mi and relme in this range if you are not a gamer.Overall this is the best phone in this price range at the moment.

  I am writing this review after extensive use of the gadget.First of all i am very satisfied with the delivery done by Amazon.I want to start it from the price of phone. At this price it is the best budget phone available in the market for the moderate users.Weight is bit higher than expected as it is plastic body but weight is secondary matter so i am shifting from it.Camrea quality is at the peak as far as budget phones are concerned (except Oppo, VIVO).Triple camera gives depth and width in the picture and the color quality is also good.Fingerprint reader is as quick as other high budget phones.Bettery life is long lasting but the charging process takes bit higher time as company claiming the 15W fast charging. It is bit low from the mentioned value which is 6000 mAh.The brand Samsung suggest the quality of Screen and it is once again proven that samsung provides good screens.Also gadget have Update of Android 10.

  Got this product on 26th may 2020. After 16 days of use i was facing problem in charging. It is in samsung service center from 13th june. Now i came to know there is a problem in motherboard. Motherbord need to replace and it will take another 4 days to replace. Samsung is making veru cheap quality phone in india. I dont know how long this phone will run further after motherboard replacement. There is no minus rating option then i will give minus rating. Control with your emotion for indian make phone otherwise you will suffer. I am a samsung phone user. I am using a6+. After 6 month of use there was a issue with date cable, purchased from samsung care. My wife was using galaxy m10 whose display is not working just after 1 year.

  I've been using this phone for over a month now.Here are the pros and cons:-Pros:-1. Great battery life2. Super display3. Camera is very good ( would be better if the promode had options to control shutter speed and all)4. Selfies are also very good5. Build quality is good, feels sturdy6. Fingerprint scanner is good( it didn't register my finger print a couple of times apart from that it worked every time)7. Face unlock is also super fast8. Speakers are loud enough and sound quality is also goodCons:-1. There were some bloatwares (most of them can be uninstalled or deactivated)2. There is some problem with instagram and samsung keyboard, it crashed a couple of times (maybe this is a problem with my device, I asked about this to my other friends who have samsung devices but none of them had this problem)3. The chip with this device is not as powerful as other devices in this segment like realme or redmi(if you are looking for hardcore gaming I would recommend realme 6)4. Would be better if it had a macro lens5. Other devices in segment like redmi note 9 and all has full glass finish, so this device wont feel as premium as those6. Charging speed is low ( yes I know that this has 6000mah battery but a 30W charger would've been better, atleast support for 30W )

  First thumbs up to Amazon for quick delivery. Samsung M21 is best mobile for daily users like me. I don't play heavy games on mobile. As far build quality is concerned it's not perfect as all back panel is plastic, but looks premium. Battery last one and half days even watching movies for 4-5 hours.  Doldy Sounds is great like watching in mmultiplex. Display is superior You will enjoy the displays. Camera in rear click great photos specifically Landscape photo you will enjoy. Portrait photo come cute with f1.7 can have nice bokeh effect. You can more creative with 3rear camera . Front camera is good for Video calls n selfie.  Great mobile for budget friendly people.  You must have to purchase good back cover urgently.  One advice for Samsung...You should bring 6GB Ram and 128 GB  storage and nice camera mobile in budget of 15k but DISPLAY SHOULD BE BETWEEN 5.5 INCHES to 5.8 INCHES. Specifically Men required small mobile with great specs.  Overall 4 stars . I m deducting ONE star for big display.

  After buying this smartphone,you would be not that satisfied with the product.Dont replace the product on the very first day.You would not be that satisfied.The heating issue gets automatically solved after 24hrs.....but but trust me you would love the phone after two days or so.Also,processor gets heated up on booting the phone.But it's not an issue.Only for few hours the heating issue lasts.It takes almost 2 and a half hours for full battery charge.Camera quality is way too good.Recommended phone.Buy it Now!! Kudos to Samsung India.

  At this price range, the best features are-* Display - no question can arise here* Battery - may drain quickly for some depending on the sensor and background apps usage. Can be optimized* Camera- good photos can be clicked in bright day light. Selfie camera is better than most other phones at this range. Performance not up to the mark in low light.* Finger print sensor - fast and accurate.* UI - clean with no ads.To talk about the downsides* Overall built- could have been better. Usage of back cover is recommended.* Gorilla glass 3 - Providing Gorilla glass 5 for the screen would have left no complaints.* Signal Reception- found it to be low compared to some other brands using same SIM at same location. This can be improved.Verdict- Overall a brilliant phone at this price range. Can be chosen over Chinese brands at this price point. One can utilize the features of the phone if used diligently.

  Very Good phone from Samsun.Now a day we r not purchasing the Chinies product this is the best phone in Between Rs 15K.Requesting to Samsung please release some products in Between Rs 10K.

"
"

  overall its a nice phone,1.with 6 gb of ram and pop up window option you can to multitasking very easily.2. intially when i bought it the front camera was making my face appear like a cartoon, picture didn't had clarity but after updating the phone the problem got solved, hope in the future updates camera features might improve.3. battery back is good, it last easily for 2 days on moderate usage and 1 day if used continuously.4. some of the one ui features are quiet good like the dark mode option, one hand usage, pop up view and some other minor features which are very useful.5. preinstalled  apps can be disabled and their is hardly any notifications from samsung if you didnt allow them in the setup.6. super amoled display is awesome, its like the best display you will get on a phone.i liked my phone, will suggest this to others.

"
"

  I bought two of these for my parents.Pros:1. Finger print reader and face unlock good features.2. Screen is huge. Good for media consumption.3. Audio is loud. Not the greatest but what can you expect from a mobile.4. Fast enough.5. USB C6. Battery life - pretty good.Cons:1. The camera sucks. If you want to buy a phone and the camera is a main feature then skip this. One of the worst cameras I have ever seen in my life. Since my parents don't use the camera much, they're ok with the phone.2. Unnecessary apps which cant be removed like FB, Netflix etc. Samsung store also cannot be uninstalled. Had many apps installed which I didn't want like Snapchat, Dailyhunt (what is it even), etc.

"
"

  Battery: The battery is great and can last almost 2 days on moderate usage.Display: Display is fantastic. Vivid colours, big screen are definitely a big part of the phone's appeal.Camera: The camera performs decently under well lit conditions. But really struggled in low lighting.Fingerprint scanner: The fingerprint scanner is fast but every once in a while it fails to register my fingerprint. Probably due to the dust but definitely something I noticed in the long run.Processor: Mediocre. For normal usage, it is probably fine. But not made for gaming.Bottom line: Good for people that need a tough, long lasting phone with a trustable manufacturer. Not for those looking for cutting edge phones with great gaming, or have a keen interest in clicking photographs.

"
"

  Let me tell you the cons alone1, low light camera looks funnier.2, full charging takes around 165mins.3, some bug issues which will get cleared in the updateOther than this display, pixel, sound, battery, multi tasking, performance looks great with the oneUIOver all a good mobile at this price with this specs,  value for our money - 9/10*Review after 5 days*

"
"

  ¬†I am giving this review on the basis of my 5 days of in hand experience, first of all it's an very good comeback of Samsung with M series for that big thumbs up from me.By the way the overall phone is good for usage as it is coming with 6000mAh battery which lasts for more than a day, The cameras are very much good it's having much better pixel quality there are some issues like focus is not good but this kind of issues can be resolved in updates, one of the bestest thing is Samsung's one UI which gives an boost to its performance which is having too much features and there are so many options for customisation which gives a better look to its UI, it is very much Handly, it looks premium in hands, but personally I felt that the fingerprint sensor was not at right place because it's felt quite difficult to me for use but I am totally satisfied from this phone and I am recommending this phone for you guys.

"
"

  The screen is the highlight. Battery life is great but little underwhelming, it can do one and a half days easily, but never make it to the end of the second day, and slow charging.Performance is barely adequate. Lags if you mulltitask .Pubg plays fine, but occasional framedrops, especially when another squad is nearby ,or doing deaddrops. Not good at gaming.Camera is average, main sensor takes good photos, but focus hunting issue is there. Every other cam is just average.Weight is less and manageable. One ui works very well. But some  ads,bloat,spamy recommendations are there, but can be disabled for clean experience.This is a great phone to buy for your parents, for the millenials i recommend look into something with a bit more performance.

"
"

  The touch screen has stopped working completely on the 8th day of use. This is such a sad trick as Amazon gives 7 days replacement which is over. Upon calling samsung helpline number they are saying that the window is 13 days to replace if bought from samsung but Amazon keeps lesser window on purpose. No way to replace touch now as corona times and high risk. No door to door service. Touch is gone and phone hangs even when used only inside the house and with utmost care.

"
"

  Cons:Touchscreen doesn't often respond fast, or worse, not at all.Too many unwanted and mostly useless pre-installed apps clutter the phone.No way to block unwanted commercial text messages that have LETTERS as senders and NOT a phone number.Pros:The rest of the features that I have used in about 50 days since I bought it has been more or less satisfactory.The phone is new; so battery is in good shape.Colour capture of the main camera is really good.

"

  I have been writing review after using this Phone 15 days . This Phone is truly a Monster in the range of 15k. I love this Phone battery so much, it doesn't drain very fast whether you play games or Watch movies. Now talk about its amoled display it's Very Cool but in day light its brightness little low. Fingerprint reader works very fast . I'm not facing any heat problem or hang problem till now . I'm little dissatisfied with camera of this phone but they already provided lot of things in 15k.If you are looking phone for in the range of 14 to 15k. You could try this.

  Reviewing it after 1 month. I have tried and tested all the features in different conditions and considering the budget my review is as followsIn hand feel: Samsung has done a great job in packing 6000 mah big battery and still the phone is not bulkyDisplay: Samsung Super AMOLED üî• no need to say anything else best display Samsung displays are world renowned and you will get a flagship experience in watching movies and Widevine L1 certified tooCamera: Good job as its photos are more natural as compared to Chinese brands and A.I scene detector really improves the photoProcessor : Trust me if you play 1 or 1.5 hrs pubg you will get about 40 fps which is too good and day to day tasks run smoothBattery: Best üíØFingerprint reader is fastVerdict: don't buy Chinese phones it is really a good one and if you don't do heavy gaming then just purchase it.. Great display, great battery,camera too

"
"

  Okay. So I have 4+64 GB variant and I have been using it from almost one nd half months. So I think now it is perfect time to review it.Okay so I'll start with the pros.PS- I think most of you would've know them so I'll not say much...1. 6000mah (OMG!) battery. For battery I will give (10/10).2. Super amoled display! Which is my fav reason to buy this phn. (10/10)3. 20 MP front camera! (9/10)4. Nd it gives widevine L1 certification which some other phns of this price segment still struggles to give.Now comes to the Cons:-1. Processor - yes! one of the big considerable feature need these days. I mean it's runs on exynos 9611. You can't play pubg for so long in this phn as it starts heating (not so serious heating). It starts heating within 30-40 minutes of gaming. And heating may affect the long term performance of the phn.2. Built quality - good but not so good! It's been only one month and I have started seeing scratches on the back. And ofcourse the the finger prints.*These are the only two CONS which I consider in case of this phone*And speaking about the back Triple camera, it's neither a PRO nor a CON. although the cameras are good, captures good pictures but the thing that many of you would not like is that it doesn't have a Quad camera. Well but actually it still click good pictures I mean there is no need of an extra 2 MP camera of no use. Lol.:- And at last I want to conclude that -1. if you want a phone to stream content like movies Netflix and even YouTube then believe me! The feel of streaming on SAMOLED DISPLAY is amazing!2. a monster battery to use for long hours. Just go for this phone!:-And if you want a phone with better built quality nd to play high graphic games. Then you can consider others.* Nd one of the PRO I forgot to mention is that ""it's not Chinese!"" Lol.*And that is the reason I like this phone.And if this review is helpful then thank me later.üòÇ

  I have being using Samsung M21 since 45 days and I must say it is surely next generation phone at very competitive price, I really loved the camera filters of this gem, battery life is awesome catering to my need perfectly since I see lot of content on OTT platforms using my phone, also sound quality of speaker is just right for the video calls so that I can speak to  my friends without even headphones, last but not least the made in India tag on my phone makes me so proud about it everytime when I hold it in my hand, on the down side I feel it would have been better if it would have been a bit lighter, but it is surely not a big issue.

  Never give a chance to regret.. Go ahead...üëçThe Icons looks was not so great .. And then I set'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning üôÇ ).. So I turned off fast charging option..You can do that.. Its will not affect batteryMONSTER :1. Battery :- 5/5Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:- 4.99/5Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:3/5It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers

"

  Value for moneyDon't buy premium mobiles Don't waste money.This is like premium with big battery .Worthy.In this Corona crisis help poor instead buying premium mobiles.

"

  If I have been given the chance to numerically rate it i would have given 4.8/5 . Everything about this phone is good literally everything and i am reviewing this phone after 3 months of hardcore use and gaming . Its gaming performance is very good no lag no fps drop . Camera quality is just unbelievable . Phone is very speedy and never freezes or hangs.The only thing for which i am cutting fown 0.2 stars is that this phone get heated up by gaming within 45-30 mins which is the only issue( idk if everyone faces this and this happens more if there is a back cover) . Got delivery very fast within 5 days ie 2 days before expected date and at 12,699 . My variant is 4gb 64gb and if anyone is wondering about any game I once ran pubg and played without any lag on hdr and I play cod mobile everyday without any issue at high most settings possible . It comes with lifetime preloaded Microsoft office mobile pack and it is really a MONSTER

"
"

  Nice buy at this price. But the mobile I got has a lot of software issues. It's showing network signal without sim card ü§£. With a memory of 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM it still gets stuck and the touch goes unresponsive while setting up the device. App cloud always interferes with Google Play Store and it too gets stuck on the screen. I thought it to be a defective peace and got a refund. Later I bought the same mobile hoping that these issues won't be there in new one. But these are common issues in this model. Need to accept all Samsung terms and conditions then the mobile is working OK. Amazon's customer service is very good.

"
"

  No doubt the smartphone works like a charm, been using it for almost three weeks now and here are some pros and cons.The screen clarity and resolution is exceptional, it's nowhere less than apple phones because Samsung manufactures displays for apple. So no compromise there, then the selling point of the phone is that massive 6000 mAh battery. In my daily use it gave me a full day plus some extra hours, I am a casual user playing pubg for 2-3 hrs, browsing a lot, media consumer and a photo enthusiast. And this phone really gives a very good battery life. The cameras are good, in broad day light and room lighting the picture quality is quite good. When it comes to low lights, it's a mess but manageable at this price point.Talking about the cons I saw a few lags sometimes while closing apps, it's not a huge problem but shouldn't have happened. Another thing is the small charger that Samsung provided, it literally takes almost 3 hrs to charge.Considering a normal user, Samsung has done its job. We have a beautiful smartphone with all the right features without any compromises.

  This is my first Samsung phone as I was die hard fan of Xiomi... so in starting I was having a difficulty using all the features...but now....this review is being written after 10 days of its use....Battery: once you have charged  100%, then you forget about recharging throughout the entire day even you have actively used it by watching movies and listening musicDisplay is fantastic... gives a smooth lookCamera quality is awesome and very easy to use..wide angle will serve the purpose as its name sugeest...I love a feature called focus mode..which let you to focus on your work and feature deactivate all the active app for time being...Nevertheless..as Iam still in position of exploring more n more feature... I will keep updatingHappy UsingüòÉüòä

  First of all no other company gives super amoled screen at this price range. Its 6000mah battery will never let you down. Phone comes with 48mp primary camera which is really good at this price range. It's look brilliant at dark mode with some dark wallpaper. Only one thing which was complained by many users about its charging time, which I think really don't matter. ""slow and steady win the race"". Tell me who else give 6000mah battery which last upto 2 days. Just go for it guys. üëç

  I purchased Sansung M21  (6GB | 128 GB) about a month ago and must say it is truely amazing !!The screen brightness is fabulous and phones camera is awesome .... other phones in the same segment are a compromise in my personal opinion when it comes to camera qualityTouch is responsive, FHD screen making viewing amaingAnd performance wise I am very completely satisfied. I can run multiple apps in the backround and there is no lagI played some high graphics games (Incluing Pug G) which ran smoothCall reception is not an issueOver all Samsung UI is quite appealingIt has App drawer so get all apps  in alphabetical order unlike peers where finding app icon is the biggest challengeMost importantly  the phone has no cheap adtvs so it give s a very premium look and feelOver all I will say this phone is a must buy for everyone who has budget of 16k

  When I am charging this phone it gets heated , on this phone of sim tray my sim cards not clearly fitsüëé, camera and screen quality is awesome üòáüëç, within 8 days of use its fingerprint sensor speed decrease,network strength is also week.And then I replace this phone becoz I have 10 days replacement warranty for this same phone,and this new not give any issue. I must say this phone very good for average users also for average gamersüëç, also one advice to samsung that this phone signal strength is very weak becoz previous phone give me good signal strength on same area but this phone is very at it üòîüò†. This phone is very user friendly becoz of samsung UI also dark mode creates a premium impact on this phoneüòáüòá. Camera quality also very good and wide angle shots are a very very good. Camera clarity is average but you like it because of color saturationüëçüòç.Though it has massive battery but it gives me average performance becoz it also drains in night and it gives me complete two days performanceüôÇ.

  I was thinking of buying a new non-Chinese mobile phone basically for home use during corona lockdown period and my first option was ‚ÄòSamsung Galaxy M21‚Äô  from South Korean brand. I have also used Samsung mobile earlier and I was very satisfied with that. So I ordered ‚ÄôSamsung Galaxy M21‚Äô  Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage.  From world class service of Amazon I also received exchange offer and attractive pricing. I paid just Rs.  11,171/-.I am using this phone from last 20 days and I am totally satisfied with this product. During lockdown period we are using it continuously for online learning, social media and lots of other things. Special thanks to  unmatched 6000mAh battery and 15 W fast charging.  Display quality is also very best with  6.4"" sAMOLED FHD+ Infinity U Display. I have noticed this display is giving less stress to my eyes even after long use. Exynos 9611 octa core  processor with GPU is diving excellent performance in multitasking and gaming. Another main feature of this mobile with a decent price tag is its 48MP+8MP+5MP main Camera and 20MP Selfie Camera .  Camera quality and number of features provided in camera section are extraordinary.  My whole family is fully satisfied with camera performance.Apart from man features its finger print scanner and Fast face unlock feature saves lot of time while using the phone and also provides very good security to the device. UI 2.0 user interface is very good and user friendly.  Also it is one of the safest smartphones with 0.468W/Kg SAR Value. I will also give full marks to its design and sound quality. The call quality and 4G connectivity is great.Pros and Cons : Only Pros No Cons!I recommend Samsung Galaxy M21 to all as it is a  perfect combination of what we need at very affordable price. Thank you Samsung ! Thank you Amazon. !

  One of the perfect phone with ultimate combination of 4gb ram and 64gb rom...1st of the best is its battery life after I charged for the first day I did not charge it for 2 days continously in spite of my whole day online classes the battery was just downed to 19 percent..Next is the camera quality which also spells awesome perfect recordings snaps and slow motion cum hyperlapse visuals greatU can play any of the game with best graphics quality coz it has super amoled display..If I can say genuinely u can buy this phone just for its display quality...awesome performance..This is my review after 1 week of usage...Really admired and admirableDon't missout

  This is the worst product I have ever seen,I complained about the product to your customer care to replace it as it was not working properly but she said that it would be ok in 2-3 days rather than replacing the product. The screen is going off and it hangs really badly and I am not able to use it once it goes off for the next half an hour.It is really difficult to bring back the screen since no button or touch seems to fix it. If you are not going to refund my money or change the product, I am going to put it on Facebook and media about your services and products. The screen does not respond even when I am receiving calls.

  Never give a chance to regret.. Go ahead...üëçThe Icons looks was not so great .. And then I set'Spherlue Icons' from theam and now its looks better with dark mode ...Even though its 6000 Mah I always leaves phone on charging before go to bed ( I like to see my phone 100% every morning üôÇ )..

  I am writing this review 2nd time after 2 month of extensive use.till now the phone is working perfectly except one mistake or error,  whatever, which was I earlier also mentioned that while making or receiving call sometime voice not come of other person. However that problem can be fixed after rebooting the phone. But it feels not good. Second problem that I faced on this handset is data network breaks continuously and to resolve this problem I need to turn off and on flight mode in every 5 to 10 minutes.However apart from these cons. Phone works perfectly. Gameing is also good. Camera is also ok in this budget segment. Battery is USP of this phone so definitely 5 star for that. Best budget phone and average performance.

  Non gaming reviewEdit : After about 1 month of purchase :Basically I am a person of multitasking and smartphone is kind an important thing for me in my profession.Even I would like to light some out of the box and jaw dropping features . I got this phone @ 12,699 and hence I would be talking with features keeping in mind this price . So let's get straight into it:1) A monster with tank of 6000 mAh . (If u don't actually how much big is 6000 mAh .Just think of 10000 mAh power bank !!!! Man u can understand)2) Even today as per any tech expert he/she would prefer a 60 Hz AMOLED panel over 90/120 Hz IPS LCD panel. So display lovers are gonna love this . As the colours are vivid and blacks look like blacks . If you are switching from IPS LCD to AMOLED u will note the difference.3) Dude the camera is insane !!!. U get a 48 MP primary sensor which shoots clear , sharp and quite colour accurate pics . Even u get 8 MP Ultra wide sensor which even other companies compromise with 5/2 MP . And also a 2 MP depth sensor which most of us would prefer than a macro sensor. The dynamic range of camera is good and auto-focus works well.It's not yet over... U even get support to shoot super-steady , slo-mo and hyperlapse videos and even u can shoot videos at UHD 4k with rear camera. Dude it's insane @ 12,699. U even get 20 MP single front selfie camera . And Samsung selfies are even quite smooth and 20 MP shoots quite detailed selfies .So camera lovers gonna love these specs.4)U even get support of extras like Dolby Atmos , Widevine L1 so u get an immersive and awesome experience while streaming HD content on Netflix, Amazon Prime.5) The last but not the least the ones who have already used Samsung before know about the bloatware free Samsung One UI in which u get cool looking icons and the design of the phone is good for one handed usage .But not everything is perfect in this world :-Cons:1) The built quality is kinda average as the back is polycarbonate so u need to buy back cover as well as its not included the box. There is no radiant look on back . So display lovers can feel disappointed.2) U only get support of 15 W fast charging and it takes 2 hours for the phone to fully charge . But once it gets charged it is a tank and can easily work over for about more than 1.5 days.Buy summing upDisplay : 5/5Built quality : 4.5/5Processor : 4.8/5Camera : 5/5Battery: 10/5Performance : 5/5Value for money : 10/5That's all.

  I am Am writing this review after the usage of 5 days.I am Very Much satisfied with my product.I am a casual user like browsing social media and clicking photos.Build and Protection:  m21 mainly lagging on this department we can feel the cheapless quality from holding the device.Display: Super amoled is Great.Absoulte best under 15k.Deep blacks are great also i use batman wallpaper so you knowüòãProcessor: It is a Okay One.Also my device get warm when loading more than 5 apps in background.But in good side the optimization is very good.After along time thumbs up for SamsungCamera : You can See the Photos i mentioned up.In many Samsung (GM 1 or 2)sensor  the pop colours  arent accurate but in case of m21 its opposite the colours are balanced and blurring also good and The sharpens and details are great.Indoor and Night time the camera did struggle little bit like out of focus and cropping the picture etc.Also the video recordings aren't very much impressing.but the ulta wide angle camera is best.front cam the Samsung doing the same beautify  real face like 5 years ago. the details are washed out also the colours aren't accurateIn additional you know that amoled screen pop the colour little bit but in m21 i see very much difference when i saw a same picture that i send to my friend(Redmi Note 5) the picure was very much beautiful than in my phone.So i think the optimisation of sAMOLED isn't  accurate ithink that will be fixed in next updateSoftware: One UI is Pure,Optimised And security will give youBattery: 6000 mah is greatPressent time the lockdown period is best to calculate it. It nailed you can easily go 1 and half day in a hard use but charging  will take 2 and half hour to fully charge.So Final Verdict is that if your a social media addict,watch movies and click random picks you can go for it.Also i didn't get much difference in m31 and m21 other than front cam is 32mp.

  Ordered on 3/8/2020, and got it on 6/8/2020.Good mobile that money can buy. Used for about a week.Why I like this one, is...1. It comes with better battery. Charges to 100% in 3 hrs2. Good mobile with best specs at best rate.But it's not made to give you feel like using a premium mobile. Which it's actually not (in the end of the day, we get reminded of it's cheap price).I don't actually hate the mobile, because I basically loves Samsung phone and don't use many apps that we can use in mobile phones. (I.e., photoshops, social media, games, etc.,).Given that, I guess it may not suit you, if you're a type who....1. demands or can't tolerate bad user experience on software side2. drains the mobile with those kind of intense apps. Even battery don't feel like its 6000mh, lasts only 1 day for normal use (I.e.,using mobile hotspot for 10 hours, surfing in mobile internet browser, and nothing else). The mobile is not packed well with software, it doesn't even have built in music player.Camera quality is better. For me it's more than satisfying. I bought M21, because I was only looking for trustworthy chipset, better display tech, big battery. The bad user experience side is just unexpected but eventhough, for me it could become handy over time.......apparentlyPros:Best budget phone that don't compromise on specs.Cons:Yet, gives bad user experience.In short: Samsung m21 is nothing more than best budget phone, with huge battery. Only buy this if you only want Samsung mobile at low price and nothing else If you're ok with its Chinese rival companies like Redmi, chances are you can still buy better mobile in cheaper rates(sorry , I have aversion to those brands for some unknown reasons) If you can't afford bad software packages, wipe away the idea  of buying samsung M series mobiles. Or at least  M21. After all it all costs the same money

  Pros:1. Display clarity2. Camera3. Battery life4. Fast charging within 1 hr from Zero to 100 percentCons-1. SMS Menu is very poor - lot of emty space provided before scrolling the text messages2. Wi fi hotspot from smartphone does not connect to other devices immediately. It takes minimun 2 minutes for other devices like laptop or other smartphone to catch the hotspot.Overall happy and satisfied with product.

  Just after few hours of use, the touch screen stopped responding. The phone was working completely fine, but i couldn't do anything as the screen wasn't responding to the touch. The physical buttons are working  fine though I tried to restart it, even tried to start in on safe mode but no luck.

  Disclaimer: Before reading further kindly know that I updated my phone before using it, so if you are facing any issue with poor camera quality, etc. just update your phone before calling it completely useless. If the glitch is still there after the update, maybe yours is actually a faulty one. Call Samsung at once!Review:What do you want from your phone?Good looks,Stunning display,Strikingly good camera andLast but most important, humungous battery life?If thats what are looking for in around 15K range, just stop searching and go for Samsung Galaxy M21.1. Good looks - It has a minimilistic uni-body design with Gorilla glass protection.2. Stunning display - You get a huge super AMOLED display with great resolution and superb pixel density of 403 ppi.3. Strikingly good camera - You get 3 + 1 camera set-up which knows how to click great portraits and selfies. Has electronic image stabilization as well.4. Humungous battery life - 6000 mAh. Need I say more? Yes, the charger is a bit slow and takes around 2.3 hours to fully charge it but that's not a deal breaker for me when you don't have to charge daily. Is it for you?5. Bonus fact: Processor - It has a Samsung's Exynos 9611 which is not exactly equivalent but comparable to a mix of Snapdragon 665 and 710 in different aspects.All in all, I did my homework before buying this one. In comparison to other Samsung devices in this range, this one has best of both worlds. Also, if you compare it to other non-Samsung android phones in the same price range - they may offer a thing or two extra but they dont have a solid after sales service like Samsung, plus they are mostly Chinese which is a no-go for many these days. Now, YOU choose! ;)I hope this review would have brought some clarity to your phone selection dilemma.

  Product  is over all good. I purchased this mobile for recording my classes. Cam quality is very good. If you charge once 100% you can use 2 ,3 days with out charging only for phone calls and msgs. Videos editing  or watching  youtube videos these actions  may consume  battery  power you need to charge the phone  same day. I don't know about  pubg. I'm not a pubg player. Phone heating  is too less. I did not checked  fingerprint  sensor.  I using  just keeping swipe lock.It is worth product  than mi and appo and vivo.Its better to uninstall  unnecessary apps. I observed my phone  is not connecting to wifi. Always  it is disconnecting. I don't know what's the problem either it is in android 10 version or in my home wifi . Now I'm using mobile  data. I got this product  mobile + temperedglass  one day before the delivery  date. Thanks to Amazon. But back case will arrive this saturday. I'm waiting  for that.

  So, I had completed more than 2 months with Samsung M 21 and honestly I am quite satisfied features offered by the Samsung this time on this price, because when we look few years back Samsung was playing a rigidly poor  player in low medium price segment game. But, when I look to my current device ( M21 ) I can assure you that No smartphone in same price segment can beat it when it comes to display ( yeah, as we know amoled technology pioneer in display technology which is owned by Samsung ), customer convenience ( IT MADE ME FAN, ALMOST ""NO"" ANNOYING ADVERTISEMENTS ), SOFTWARE ( MAN, IT'S THE BEST OUT THEIR, it not sophisticated or over customized just simple & cool & DEFINITELY, WHEN IT COMES TO HARDWARE YOU MIGHT SEE IT BIT INFERIOR, BUT HOLD ON GUYS SAMSUNG HAS DONE A DAMN GREAT WORK IN OPTIMIZING THEIR SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE, IT'S NEVER LET YOU DOWN. NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO ""GAMING"". ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T FACED ANY LAG TILL NOW WHILE PLAYING PUBG MOBILE  BUT, DEFINITELY SAMSUNG NEED TO WORK ON HEAT REDUCING SYSTEM, CAMERA IS ALL AWSOME AND A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF SOFTWARE & HARDWARE FUSSION ( I HAD PROVIDED FEW IMAGES CLICKED FROM DEVICE & NO 2ND OR 3RD PARTY EDITING SOFTWARE USED ). & I DON'T FEEL THIER IS NEED TO COMMENT ON IT'S BATTERY CONSUMPTION BECAUSE IT'S A MONSTER, SOME TECH REVIEWERS WERE NOT SATISFIED FROM ITS CHARGER BUT IT ENOUGH FOR ME AS IT TAKES ABOUT 2 HOURS TO REACH 0 -100. IT CAN EASILY STANDS 2 DAYS ( IF U ARE NOT RUNNING HEAVY APPS ) ELSE WITH ULTA POWER SAVING IT GOES UPTO 4 DAYS. ATLAST, ITS A QUITE SATISFACTORY PRODUCT FROM A BRAND LIKE SAMSUNG AT SUCH PRICE.

  At this price range this phone has best display and battery life if you are not prone to games or some heavy task than this is the best choice in this price segment, Thanks to Samsung also able to manage the quality and functionality of this phone without increasing the price while others brands increased the price to 500 to 1000 on this price segment due to increase in GST, In one word go for it, you will not regret it that's for sure.

  A great phone from samsung. I have been using it for a month and the performance is really good. the battery last for a full day if you're a heavy user and can go for one and a half day for normal uses. Finger print sensor is very fast. only drawbacks are face unlock and gaming performance. The face unlock is somewhat slow and you can play all the games but not with highest graphics. The camera performance is also good in good lighting conditions. I am attaching some picture.Overall its a really good phone If you are not a heavy gamer.

  This review is written after 1 week of heavy usagePros:-1) The massive 6000 mAh battery which gives at least 1 day battery backup.2)The camera:-It's  48 mp sensor beats many devices at this range.The ultra wide angle camera boosts the colours which looks attractive.You can also take excellent close ups with its ultra wide angle camera.So what's the use of a macro camera.3) The amazing sAmoled display.4) It supports Dolby Atmos and also wide vine L1.5)Its Sar value is very less. So it radiates less.Cons:-1) It heats a lot while I take my online classes and hangs after 1¬Ωhours of takings classes on Google meet.2)It supports only 15 watts charging which takes 2 hours and 45 minutes approx.3)Frequent lag issues and frame drops while multitasking.4)Face unlock doesn't  recognize my face in low light, which is not a big issue as I use the fingerprint sensor more.5) The depth sensor works or not, it is still a mystery for me as when I tried to put my finger on the depth sensor, it was still able to take pics but when I put my finger on the 48mp sensor it became dark. So, the 3 cameras are just a show off. Basically the 2 other cameras  take the pics.Overall it's a ""Dad's"" phone as he just uses the phone for multimedia and not for gaming and he needs a veeeeerrrryyy big battery life.Thank You Amazon for a faster delivery  than Flipkart.

  I will tell you all guys that this mobile is really a monster as mentioned by the company. As it offers all the best possible features by Samsung this time. I didn't expected these much from  Samsung guys. I am a student guys and this monster 6000 mah battery is serving its best battery backup for all the classes. Since I am not heavy user then also I am getting about 12 hrs of screen on time with charging at some times. But also the battery will get you along the whole day surely. And the processor is also very good at my using point of view. Buy unfortunately this mobile doesn't fit for gamers. You can play pubg mobile in hdr graphics but lag is the problem there. And all the other features are the best offered by Samsung. The camera quality is superb guys. And since today's most of brands are giving 48MP and 64MP cameras in this price range but  this camera almosts beats the realme6 and redmi note9 pro in most of aspects. And charging is slow in the phone but we can manage since most of us were using very slow chargers than this for our older phones even I was been using Samsung's J2 for the past 4 years which used to charge fully in about 3 hrs. And the display is awsome guys. None other than Samsung is providing you with sAMOLED displays at this price range. And the main thing that I mainly liked here was the security. Yes the fingerprint sensor and face ID recognition is working as faster as I thought. The mobile will unlock with just a single tap even when the fingerprint sensor has a little of smudges and dirt. Then no that much cons I have mentioned but I will surely say that those who are interested to get a good battery, camera, user interface, display and brand can surely go for it.

  Camera software is quite slow.On clicking photos in 48 mp settings, it takes about 4-5 seconds to process the image and save the image. Hence clicking continuous instant photos one after the other in 48 mp setting is near to impossible. Samsung really need to work on this camera software and provide with a fast performing camera software update as soon as possible. Otherwise other than this , picture quality is upto the mark .

  Please do not buy this phone it is worth less. its not even splash proof. some water splashed on phone that's it dead forever. it was not even a glass of water. they do not mention about anything water resistant or flash proof. fake advertisement to make money once water splashes need to pay for repair. FRAUD BUSINESS. its like a kids toy no proper assembling just fixed few plastic pieces so that it can look like a phone.

  Hello,  I m writing this review to save your money to avoid wasting on this product. I would suggest to the buyers not to buy Samsung Galaxy M series mobile, specially M21 and M31. Now days we are getting very bad quality Samsung mobiles. Camera quality and Battery life is not good.I have purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 in 5th June. after 2 months I m getting Monile is Automatically Restarts problem, it was restarting again and again, if you want to switch on the  phone, then need to connect with the charger then also not getting started, you have to do it same thing again and again, my mobile was warranty hence I reached out to the nearest Samsung Service Center to check and fix the problem. At service center mechanical checked my mobile and told me that its an software issue. Need to update the software so bugs will get removed and it will get fixed. For that they kept the mobile with them for 2 days. After 2 days I called up and confirm for the same and went to the service center. Mobile mechanical checked everything if it is working fine or not then given the mobile to me. Once I came back to home and connected to the charger to battery get charged then again same problem started happening ( Mobile getting Automatically Restarted ). When I m trying to charge the battery mobile gets Automatically Restart, thats the reason I m getting frustrated. Again I called to service center for the same problem. Service center incharge ask to submit the mobile in service center to recheck again.  Its very hectic and time consuming home.I personally experienced and observed that there were 50 to 100 customer came with the same kind of problems. relatedto Samsung M series mobile.Some of you have positive feedback too. I m just sharing my personal experience and findings.

  Best mobile phoneSize name: 6GB RAM, 128GB StorageColour: BlueHere is my review on the new samsung m21.I'm using this smartphone from 2 months so I can give my comment to help you guys make up your decision.I categorise my review based on the following points:(a) Built Quality (b) Display (c) Camera (d) Performance (e) Software (f) Battery(A) Build quality: It's a nice looking phone with a standard build quality nothing fancy on the back. Plain standardised back side with glossy finish but very well built keeping in mind it has 6000 mah battery. It's feels quite light in hands. It's a sturdy phone and it can handle if it accidentally it drops sometime. If you want to get fully packed phone in this price range it's a good phone to buy with this build quality.(B) Display: We all know samsung make great displays so here also it's a 6.4 inch water drop notch mailed display which is amazing in this price range. I bought this phone only for its great display and cameras. I mostly watch videos on my phone and it's a great experience. Even the touch response is also very good in samsung phones. Amoled display and 6000 mah battery is a great combination.(C) Camera: Camera is it's highlight in this price range. Samsung captures very good photos with a good balance of colors and natural sharp photos. The colors in photos are not over saturated. It takes very good photos. M21 has 20 mp front cam and 48 mp back camera which takes amazing photos. Samsung live focus provide some amazing features. Samsung UI is brilliant providing u some amazing features in camera.(D) Performance: Samsung's performance is quite balanced with exynos 9611 series processor. I don't do much gaming but for occasional gaming it will not disappoint you but specifically for gaming you can check out some other products with better processors in this price range. But for day to day usage it performs good and samsung hi provides great performance with this processor. So you are getting a good camera bigger battery and sufficient powerful processor.(E) Software: Samsung UI is great no ads altogether and has great features which are really useful. You can check some videos on features for samsung UI. I like the Samsung standardised UI which is great easy to use and smooth.(F) Battery: For battery it's a 6000 mah battery so you can expect a 2 days battery life for normal user and 1 day full use for heavy users who do a lot of gaming movie and videos watching. But for battery you can give 7 star and samsung did a great work by keeping the phone light weigh also with this massive battery inbuilt. So it's a great phone in this price range. Fully packed samsung phone.

Good job Samsung ,it can beat 30000 rs price segment in display areaCall quality is all ok , speaker very loudBest feature I liked is that you can turn off fast charging !!!! The best feature ever. Go for this product ,best quality in budget ,

  Fast delivery by amazon within two days. But not that satisfied with the phone. Battery life is not upto the mark. Phone gets heated quickly. Camera is good though. Expected much better specifications at this price range. Some apps are automatically installed. Couldn't uninstall them.

  It is great experience with samsung M21..I think it is the best option presently in the market..One thing lacks ...1. The wire for battery charging is too much short..2. There is no OTG port in the mobile..3. Like their other Nagpur railway related tell no-0712-2536442, if company provides the Ear Phone, it will be appreciated...But I don't know why it is not so..However, better than Other products..

  First of all it has very good Processor. The speed of Processor is 2.3ghz. It has a huge battery of 6000mah. Its battery lasts for at least one day for me at 1 full charge. It has a 48 mp rear camera and a triple camera setup. You can record videos in 4k and it also has slo- motion feature. Its fingerprint reader is pretty accurate and as always the build quality of every Samsung phone is up to the mark. If we talk about screen it comes with gorilla glass three which provides you the protection from dropping damage of 5 feet. Moreover it has a too much beautiful Samoled display which has been a plus point in samsumg phones the video quality is too good in this phone. I have been using it for 6 months now and I had no issues with the phone and performance till now.

  Samsung M21 is a classy product with 6GB Ram and 128GB storage space at this affordable price range. Mobile can run without any lag or buffering. The special feature to be mentioned is it's long working battery. Once fully charged  ,it lasts for 2 days for me. Its 48 MB camera gives high clarity pictures almost similar to a DSLR. Selfie camera is simply superb and it offers new features like emojicons and super slowmos. Touchscreen is super responding. It can even get through rough uses by children. PUBG and Call of Duty can be run in ultra settings. It is accompanied by 18W fastcharger which can charge within 1 hour. The fingerprint sensor unlocks the mobile in no time. This is a best option available in this price.

"

  Battery only lasts for a 20 Hrs with normal usage, with 6000 mAh I expected more. Mobile overall is very good. Cameras are good. Even you can take macro images with main camera hence no need for M31. Screen is super awesome. In daily usage there is no stutter no frame drop. Nothing. Overall experience is very good. And software experience is much better than Oxygen OS. And yes it is made in India and some parts are imported from Vietnam South Korea and India but not from China. That's awesome.

  After using the phone for little more than 2 months here is my review.If you are a heavy gamer and looking for phone to play hugh end graphic games, kindly look away. This phone is not meant for you.Now, if you are mediocre user, who wants their phone just to do the right amount of job, then it is the phone.You get 6gb/ 128gb ram and memory respectively which ensures that your phone never lags. In most of the games i played, i had really good experience. I'm not a really heavy gamer.The screen looks premium and the display is fantastic. Reading experienceon the phone is second to none. Be it a PDF file or an ebook, this phone doesn't disappoint.Coming to the battery backup, I usually charge it after every 2 days. 6000 mah is too much. It takes 2-3 hours to get fully charged. I usually charge the phone using a powerbank and it supports fast charging through powerbank as well.Camera definitely is an above average camera. It gets you really good pictures. But here I'd like to add that there are better camera phones around at the same price bucket.Overall it is a really good phone. If you are a regular phone user and not a gamer/ photographer who doesn't want to spend a whole lot of money into phones, this phone is for you.

  I got my mobile yesterday in 3 days after order that is pretty good delivery service by Amazon India.After seeing my mobile at first my expression was Wow...I got it in 13999rs which is a little bit expensive for me bcos before one month It was sold in 12699rs. Also company is not giving any Headphone, Temper+Backcover.At least U deserve these accessories bcos U r paying extra after gst hike+ company also increase mobile price.But I don't feel regret bcos it is valuable in 13999rs also.Now come to the mobile performance.Touch is awesome.Display is pretty good it has Blue light filter setting which can reduce Blue light and will safe Ur eyes from Blue Ray's.Fingerprint sensor is quick.Camera is Ok quality not so good not so bad.Sound quality is good and there is Dolby atmos setting in Headphone which I have not tested yet.Face unlock is not so goodsome times it do not recognizes me.Also camera take 2-3 secs to save pic( those pic with large mbs).I can't tell about battery performance+fast charging. I will write it letter.I got 55% charge mobile yesterday 1 PM and charged it for 10 mins and it charged 10%.And normally used it for 9 hours and it reduce my battery 30% which is still be tested more.I hope this will help U before purchasing.Thank you...

  I hate m21 back. easily get scratches and company also not provided cover in box even screen guard.Back cover highly recommend. charging speed sucks. More than two and half hour to full charge.Other things like camera quality and  screen quality ,fingerprint reader everything is superb. Battery backup more than one day if you  heavy user.one ui best ui I've ever use. I love one ui 2.0 than realme ui1, colour os 7 and miui9.I love to use smartphones without cover & screen guard.but with m21 I have to put back cover on.___not screen guard bcs I watch guptas drop test videoü§£.One more thing... Little bit network issues.Example..where I have 3bars of jio signal in realme 5 pro, there in Samsung m21 got 2 or even 1 bar jio signal..I guess because of sar value.realme 5pro have mor than 1.2 sar value . where as Samsung m21 have nearly 0.4 sar value.Conclusion -to get something you have to loose something....You get ..killer battery backupLess weight than redmi note 9 pro..even have 6000mah massive battery.Camera quality..and mainly no camera bump like other phones.Super emoled screen.One ui..You have to sacrifice ...Charging time.Back side.Speaker output while gaming.Annoying position of headphone jack.Laggi camera appNot for extreme gaming.All together best non- Chinese phone ...Even charger also made in India ..üòÇüî•üî•

  Bought this mobile around 2 weeks back with 1 day Prime delivery from Amazon. Amazing mobile, no issues after 2 weeks of use. Very good battery life; has enough juice for 2 days of normal use on a single full charge. Good camera quality. The back camera clicks pics with rich colors, front camera isnt too great but does the job considering the price range of the mobile. The super amoled display also provides a good viewing experience and sets it apart from other phones in this price range. Full marks to Samsung UI for ease of use and relatively no bloatware compared to Chinese brands.

  Best quality smartphone ever from Samsung.  I'm really impressed with the battery capacity. 6000mah battery backup is more than enough for 30Hrs  continuous  usage having full time WhatsApp updations, heavyduty calls in one of 2SIMs, full time internet and activities in Google maps.It is now 3 weeks over. Till today, I do not have any issues. Best notable part is the handset is not heating up even if the wifi hotspot is enable for 3hrs. Handset takes approx 1:50hr for full charge.Photo and Video clarities are ok and normal. video stabilization is very average.

"
"

  It is a good phone considering everything it offers, only dissapointment was not knowing about missing software features such as dex, edge lighting, and windows screen mirroring support from samsung for m series. Still an excellent product for daily use. Not recommended for gamers. People who are looking for a good built phone with excellent UI and and an awesome screen go for it.All the hardware works as expected no complaints there.

  Samsung's Galaxy M series has added a lot of options for the Indian consumers in last one year. Continuing the trend, the online-focused Galaxy M series now has one more refresh called the Samsung Galaxy M21. Samsung launched the device in March, but unfortunately due to lockdown we couldn't get our hands on the device back then. It comes in two configuration models of 4GB RAM+ 64GB internal storage and 6GB RAM + 128GB internal storage. I've been using the 4GB RAM variant from quite sometime now, and here's my Samsung Galaxy M21 review. Also Read - Realme Smart TV full-HD 43-inch Review: Falls short on expectationsDESIGN, DISPLAY AND PERFORMANCEThe design of Galaxy M21 is much reminiscent of the Galaxy M30s. I got the blue color variant, which boasts of glossy polycarbonate back. What I really liked about the device is that it feels pretty lightweight despite carrying a massive 6,000mAh battery. Samsung has kept the weight down to 188 grams and the thickness at 8.9mm. I didn't feel the need to having a back case on this, neither Samsung has provided one in the box, which means you'll have to buy it separately. All you get in the box is a 15W charger, USB Type-C cable and some documentation with SIM ejector pin (see box contents below). Also Read - Realme Narzo 10 Review: Expanding options in the budget segmentSamsung Galaxy M21 ReviewAlso Read - Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro Review: Best smartphone under Rs 15,000?Coming to the front, it features an Infinity-U (waterdrop-notch) display. It is an AMOLED panel of 6.4-inch size and offers full-HD+ (1080x2340 pixels) resolution. This quality of this panel is amazing and I found this thing to be consistent in almost all Samsung phones. The viewing angles, contrast and brightness levels are at par with any premium phone. The only drawback is that it has an old generation glass protection , which is Corning Gorilla Glass 3. But other than that, I found everything else about the display to be great.Under the hood, the M21 packs Samsung's own octa-core Exynos 9611 SoC which I feel is a little old for the year 2020. Having said that, it is still a capable processor for daily users and PUBG Mobile lovers. You will not have problems with the average multitasking, but might see occasional hiccups during heavy usage. I would have personally liked the new generation chipset, but it seems the company's decision based on the price range, since they had to include a 6,000mAh battery with the device. Also, you get an option of getting the same device with 6GB of LPDDR4x RAM.Samsung Galaxy M21 ReviewMy review unit had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The other variant offers 6GB RAM + 128GB storage option. Users will have the option of microSD card expansion up to 512GB. The SIM tray located on the left side of the device carries triple slot. It means you can put in two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card at the same time.CAMERA PERFORMANCEThe Samsung Galaxy M21 features a triple rear camera setup for capturing photos and recording videos. It includes the same set of sensors that you'd see on Galaxy M30s. It carries a primary 48-megapixel lens with an 8-megapixel sensor carrying an 123-degree ultra-wide-angle lens and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. A little change is in the front selfie camera, it's been bumped to 20-megapixel, instead of the 16-megapixel seen on the M30s.I had reviewed the M30s last year in October, and found the camera performance to be ""average for its price and competition."" Now almost six months after, the M21 also feels the same. In the daylight condition, this setup excels with oversaturated colors, good sharpness and a great amount of detailing. The low-light and night photography is still a weak point, but overall the nigh mode has improved a bit. That said, this camera setup is for users who are not much into photography. It is mostly an average camera just because the competition is so fierce in this price segment. There is no way I can compare it to the likes of Realme 6 Pro or Redmi Note 9 Pro smartphones. You can check out the camera samples below (slideshow).samsung-galaxy-m21-camera-review-1samsung-galaxy-m21-camera-review-10samsung-galaxy-m21-camera-review-5samsung-galaxy-m21-camera-review-2samsung-galaxy-m21-camera-review-6KILLER 6,000MAH BATTERY, A MUST HAVEJust like the Galaxy M30s and Galaxy M31, this new Samsung Galaxy M21 also packs a massive 6,000mAh battery. It is the biggest highlight of this smartphone and probably the best thing as well. I feel this should be a new standard for all the smartphone companies. The battery back up is so amazing that It made me forget my charger for almost two days. I am not actively going out these days, so the battery output is comparatively better than my office going days. Otherwise, it would have lasted me about 1.5 days. Since I am also working from home just like everyone else, I am not using my smartphone for Google Maps, but there is a lot of social media apps and video watching. Hence, considering that, it is one of the best you can get for the price.Samsung Galaxy M21 ReviewSamsung has slightly improved on the charging speed, and the phone's 6,000mAh battery could now fully charge in about 2 hours 40 minutes. However, do not expect insane fast charging, as this would probably go from 0 to 24 percent in about 15 minutes.VERDICT: SHOULD YOU BUY?In my opinion, the Samsung Galaxy M21 is for those who are looking for a smartphone with big battery and do not care about the Chinese competition smartphones from the popular brands like Realme and Xiaomi. Those competitive device perform much better than the M21 and there is no doubt about it. But that said, my 4GB review unit of the M21 did a pretty decent job for an average user. The overall software experience was great, but the only thing was that the camera was a bit underwhelming. I feel Samsung may improve this a bit more with future software updates, but we are not sure of it.Overall, this Galaxy M21 smartphone is a decent package like the Galaxy M30s. The good part is that you can buy it at a lower price than the M30s. It is meant for an average user with budget constraints. So you can definitely buy it if you are looking to purchase a device for the daily usage and have big battery as a priority.

  Samsung galaxy m21 is a worthy purchase. It has an efficient process and runs on a premium software one ui 2.0. It does feel like a phone below 13k. The amoled display is immersive and has only blacks and punchy colors. Ofcourse Samsung makes the best quality display. It would have been good if Samsung could offer a glass back and an in display finger print reader.The optics are decent enough for this price range and nothing much to complain. The supersteady option available while shooting videos Is  a boon for steady videography.Enjoying using the value for money phone.

"

  Let me start with the display, this is the best display in the budget.Pros,1. Best oled display with stunning colors2. Impressive battery life( almost 2 days even  on regular use)3. Camera quality is good.4. Call quality is good5. In handfeel is so good without caseCons,1. Touch sensitivity is quite less after applying  tempered glass( maybe temperedglass is  not good)2. Cannot play heavy games as it supports  heavy games but cannot be played at good  fps.As a result this is a good phone for who is not very much into gaming. I feel this is good phone for elder people like dad and mom who doesn't play much games rather they consume some media and entertainment.This is a honest review writing after one month use.Ps. Pictures on this review was shot on another phone not on m21.

  I am writing this review using this smartphone almost for 2 months. Hope this will help the buyers. Here is what i have experienced://Huge Display with awesome colour quality.//Camera quality is just awesome. specially ,the wide angle mode is superb! Captures photo with in a blink. Pictures are real as hell! The front camera also has good quality with beautification available.//The processor, EXYNOS9611 is exactly as expected. In fact, at this range of price exynos is giving superb performance with almost no lag.//Battery is well good. It takes around 6 to 10 mins to drain 1 percent of the battery(depending on whether you are using it online or offline). You get a 15 watt travel adapter which is quite good. But as the capacity is 6000mah, which quite massive, it takes a bit more time to charge fully than usually how it should be. But once you are charged, it can take you online 2 days straight without recharging!Some more info::*When i bought this phone, i read online that samsung phones have issue with catching network. i would love to share that m21 has no such issue. network connection is very well with this phone.*All the applications are working with intelligence!*After 5days of delivery, i had this issue of auto restarting. Nothing to worry about though, its just for optimisation probably. i turned of the auto-optimisation and downloaded the updates, then it's normal again.*And plus are, you get BIXBY VISION and DOLBY inbuilt!I'd like to rate this phone 4.5/5.0So here it goes. Hope this will help y'all:)

  It is not even 2 months since I purchased Samsung M21 from Amazon and now I see screens are showing purple spots. I called Samsung service centre and they were stating that screen / display issues are not covered under warranty. It is very strange that when Samsung claims that they will be 1 yr warrant, what for that? I cleared mentioned there was no physical damage on mobile, still they responded it is not covered.My intention of buying a ""Made in India"" product is giving a negative impression and I will be happy if someone from Samsung mobile support helps in addressing this issue.

  I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for myself. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. I am writing this review after using it for a month, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone.-The display of the phone is brilliant and is amazing with the Amoled display.-The battery life is just so awesome and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is good. Its loud enough but the sound produced is lil less impressive since it lacks bass but the clarity in the sound output is good.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.- After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading.

  1st impression was wow, on Day 1 unfortunately my phone fell badly at the height of 5ft while checking camera for selfie in my mind I did accepted it that the screen must have shattered as there was no protection, but to my surprise nothing happened.Note: before to this I was using S10 Plus.""Battery Life"" trust me this will make your life very easy, you don't need to carry a power bank with you. Battery can last for two days with normal usage of call and whatsapp.""Camera quality"" After using S10 Plus definitely I will fine this camera poor but yeah for me at this budget this camera works fine. Enough for occasional use. Didn't explored much on this aspects.""Fingerprint reader"" Does the work very well and place in very good location.Processing speed is enough for handling half dozen of apps working simultaneously. Totally worth it at this price.Talking about the total package the 6GB and 128GB version is totally worth it at this price. I would insist people to go for this product at this price.The other thing I would like to mention it's the RUF & TUF  phone. The durability will surprise you and talking about the  performance it won't disappoint you.P.S. If you are a business person and have requirement of phone which full your daily electronic essentials including making calls WhatsApp Bank transfers and other apps. Go For this product. I am enjoying it without any fail.

  I was using oneplus 7 before purchasing m21. So my review will be completely based on the comparison with oneplus 7. Samsung as usual didn't compromise in the display quality as this is sAMOLED. Camera is cool, but the noise is a litle bit more compared with flagship phones, for this price range its well and good. Fingerprint is fast, i feels like samsung should add in display fingerprint in M series top end phones. Perfomance wise Exynos is simply awesome. No lags in gaming and video editing apps. Pubg, COD, Freefire all these games can be played lag free. Sound is good but can be more loud. No words to explain battery backup as it feels like carrying a weightless powerbank inside phone, minimum oneday back-up is assured only for gaming and for normal users battery may last upto three days. I had plan to purchase Oneplus Nord but the purchase of m21 made me change my mind to purchase m31 instead of nord.

  This phone comes with a overall impressive package. I'm stunned by its camera performance. The pictures taken are so vibrant. Talking about the mega 6000 mah battery. It lasts almost 2 days or with minimal usage and more than a day in full usage. Like if you play games n all. The AMOLED display adds to this excellent list of features samsung provides. Streaming full HD content in this device is a thing in its own. So before buying this phone I watched a ton of reviews on youtube. This phone is not for pubg lovers but cuz it doesn't  has such a capable process to process pubg in maximum settings. Since I don't play pubg it was fine by me. But other games such as asphalt street, n games upto one gb run smooth. I think its its enough for me to relish.

  So I bought this phone for Rs.12,099 after getting an Rs.1900 discount on amazon prime day sale ( 1400 card discount + 500 cashback ) which I think is a great deal for this phone. ordered on 6 delivered on 9.* display (10/10) comparable with the Rs. 25000 phone (no doubt).* battery (10/10) many were complaining about the battery but actually it needs 7-8 charging cycles to calibrate properly and afterwards it's really like 6000 mAh battery.* camera (9/10) great selfies and awesome pictures captured with the back camera.* fingerprint scanner (9/10) no issue in finding the position if you use back cover.* build quality (8/10) back is not that good but no problem with the back cover as it will protect the back from scratches.* Security patch as of July 2020 after the latest update and the phone does not heat much after the latest update which was seen previously.overall it has hardware, software, operating system, processor, camera sensors, RAM all made of Samsung which integrates together brilliantly giving a smooth user experience. But but but it's a mild-gaming phone you can play subway surfer, temple run 2 and more without any lag (as I have experienced).

  Thinking of buying this @12699 is partially good but not at all. If you want to buy a Samsung phone for this price it is better.Camera quality isn't so good as a 48MP camera should be, when you zoom your captured photos it'll not so clear as shown in ads. Front and rear camera has brightness but not very clear images are captured. Blur option is given which is also of no use.Battery is as same as a 4500mah battery. Fast charging is partially helpful

  Pros:-1:- Amazing software experience2:- Battery life is average, not like 6000mAh3:- Display quality is superb4:- touch response is mind blowing5:- Cameras have high dynamic range but details are not that great (not complaining due to price)6:- This is a proper phone, not like phablets7:- Network connectivity and call quality is good enough8:- USC type-C9:- Samsung Brand value10:- Android 10 with OneUI out of the box (super smooth)11:- wide angle camera is better than Redmi note 8 proCons:-1:- Cameras are not that great, dont purchase it for camera purpose2:- even with 15watt charger, it takes around 150 minutes to juice up from zero3:- Sometimes the phone feels fragile due to plastic body4:- Samsung, why u r not bringing back cover with the phone5:- Processor is not good for gaming

  I liked the AMOLED screen and the sensors, they are very accurate and fast. The camera is also good, but it's not power-efficient, the phone gets hot while using the camera even for a short duration and drains the battery. It has a 48MP camera, but 3rd-party camera Softwares can use only up to 12MP, I am a software developer, so this is a great concern for me.The loudspeaker volume is also not up to the mark, it should have been louder. A disgusting thing I have noticed is that the phone's back panel vibrates while playing audio through the loudspeaker.I thought that the 6000mAh battery should be able to provide power backup for a long time, but it behaves like a 4000mAh battery. The phone also gets heated up quickly even during slight usage and short duration (1 or 2 min) phone calls.It does not even fully support the Camera2 API which means that you can't capture photos in raw with the camera. So, if you are a photographer, don't buy this phone.

  This phone is worth for every penny you spend and the best  non-Chinese brand in this segment.  Talking about the specs this is phone with 6000 mah battery  with massive backup( a full day battery backup for heavy usage). The display is SUPERüòé AMOLED with the best  viewing angle, also the camera is of nice quality, the chipset used is exynos 9611 with the best optimisation.  The best affordable phone of the year . I've never regretted buying this and this is my go to phone for this budget.Build quality-5/5Display-5/5Battery -5/5Camera-4/5Experience-5/5Sound-5/5Weight distribution-5/5( very light to lift, no hand pain noticed)Fingerprint-4.5/5(fast fingerprint recognition but it would've been better if it was given some deep ridge but it doesn't matter if case is used)This is the only phone in this budget which provides  DOLBY ATMOS audio support.

  I received box without ejection pin which I ignored initially. Then I noticed that some of the photos were becoming completely  black which again I ignored then finally I noticed that mobile had some scratches as well so I had to raise return request. Hope this should be replaced with right product. Don't know who is responsible for it, Seller, Amazon or Samsung. But it's not at all good experience.

"
"

  P.S - I bought this for ‚Çπ12700  - After 2 month usageDisplay - Best in this segment.Battery - 2 days if you use phone for calling and to take photo, 1 day If you make call, use social media and gaming.Camera- Good but need some improvement. Night Mode is good when compared with M30s. Selfie camera should be improved.Build quality - I recommend you to use some protection. Just plastic(not happy with the build)Design- colors are not so vibrant. When you see the backside of the phone It looks like some 5k worth mobile.Processor and RAM management works fine than expected.Fingerprint, Face unlock works fine.Got one major update so far.To Samsung- Please include earphone with the package.Can easy attract any normal smart phone user but not the rough users.M21- 85 out of 100.

  I bought this phone almost a month ago and have had ample time to test this phone out. Here's what I found:1) The phone screen is BIG. Colours look very vibrant on screen and games look epic when I'm playing them on this phone.2) Camera quality is top-class. It takes a bit of time to focus on small objects but otherwise the photos look great.3) Battery life mentioned is quite misleading. Doesn't seem like 6000 mAh. I have to charge my phone almost everyday. I use it for minor gaming and listening to music. Maybe using Bluetooth headphones has that effect?4) You may want to wash your hands if you want to use the fingerprint sensor. If there is some dust on your fingertips then the sensor can't read them. Also try to keep the fingerprint sensor clean and dry at all times to use it properly.All-in-all, I would give this phone a solid 8/10.

  This mobile is almost perfect . On normal use , its battery will last one and a half  days on a single charge . Charging takes some time though , it takes almost 3 hours to charge completely . Build quality is not bad but not very good though. Its screen quality is best,  colours and brightness of this super amoled display is amazingly beautiful. This exynos 9611 is good enough for day to day usage , but its not made for heavy gaming , you can play any heavy games (like pubgm or codm) with low settings though (but there might be minor frame drops even in low settings). Camera quality is good , pictures are detailed ,not as much as 64mp cameras ,but its still good. And samsung's dynamic range is amazing , the colours from both the main sensor and ultrawide is so good. Ultrawide pictures don't have much details though . But its pro mode in camera app is almost useless for me , it dosn't have any option to increse or decrease shutter speed and focus. I like to take long exposure shots of night sky (astrophotography), but most of samsung's mobiles don't have any option to change shutter speed and focus , so I can't shoot night sky images now. And this exynos processor don't support any gcam.

  Design & durability - 3.8, design and durability would be more better Redmi and Realme offers more at this priceDisplay - 5.0, one of the best display in the segment and even we can compare this display with Samsung 'A' series smartphonesFeatures - 4.0, I think Redmi note 9 pro is the feature loaded phone compared to thisFingerprint reader - 4.0, fingerprint is not that fast but unlockes the phone in expected timeCamera - 4.4 (back camera - 4.8 & front camera- 4.0), camera is better than redmi and realme in the segmentProcessor - 3.8, I noticed some minor lags while normal use only, snapdragon processor would be betterFinal conclusion is that if you are looking for non Chinese smartphone under 15000 it would be best choiceI have used both m31 & m21 and I reccomend you to buy m21 because all things are same in both phones only difference is camera (macro lens is not available in m21 which is available in m31, primary camera is 64mp in m31 and is 48mp in m21 which would not make huge difference & selfie camera is 32mp in m21 and it is 20 mp in m21.You get more details in m31 but I think this would not make any difference at all)

  After 40 days of use I am writing this review for Samsung M21Cons :I have seen 3 times the phone got hanged for 2 minutes and then resumed working.I am not a PUBG fan but still tested the phone by playing PUBG game but unfortunately lot of lagging.Installed only 20 apps (regular apps like Paytm, google pay etc ) started seeing significant dip in the performance. The process seems not upto the mark.Finger sensor is slow in respond.The 100% battery comes 2 days if I use less ( WhatsApp, YouTube or Amazon  shopping ) however if I use it heavily then max 16-18 hours.Poor Graphic icons.Pros :Super Amoled display is really awesome.Back Camera is good.Over allIt's 3.7 out of 5Display 4.9Process speed 3Camera 4.2Touch response  3.8Finger sensor response 3Battery 3.7

  In the budget price it actually affordable.In today's competitive era samsung really make no hanging issue phone as I am a samsung lover.Samsung is not in previous samsung.Its time to burning in the market.As I study all phone in Covid-19 pandemic situation , samsung is best in the long term basis if you a game lover then go for high Ram and High processor.Otherwise  it is best truely monster.All are working fine and smooth.Thank you all readers....I have purchased in 21 May 2020.

  I have used both M21 and M31 and there is no major difference only few as M31 has one macro lens extra (not necessary for everyone) and majorly that's it.M31 and M21 both have the same processor Exynos 9611 which is slightly less powerful than snapdragon 710 but in this price segment you are getting a samoled panel which no other competitors MI, realme, redmi or anyone provides, and samoled is much better than the LCD panels.I had compared cameras of both the smartphones and didn't find any difference at all if you look without zooming, while when you zoom M31 gives a slightly sharper image as compared to M21.But I found M21 more value for money smartphone as it is nearly Rs 3,500 less.According to me the person who is considering this price range needs smartphone for normal day to day usage and a few hours of gaming and trust me it can run pubg good enough it provides smooth+extreme settings you won't find the frames dropping unless you had played pubg in higher snapdragon processor phones.You can play PUBG with smooth+extreme settings for nearly 7+ hours with earphones on a single charge.I admit that the back plastic panel feels cheap compared to the glass panels but you know nearly no one uses smartphone without a cover and after applying cover the thing you will look the most is screen and that's just beyond comparison.** if you guys want more photos then tell me I will upload.

  Like a dinosaur, there is a very large 6000mah battery which lasts for a long time. I play PUBG for at least 8 hours throughout the day and the battery still remains 40 percent, so this phone is tremendous in terms of battery. Many phones have been used, but the best battery life among them is that of this phone. Fingerprint sensor is also very good, work well. Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis also very good, but there is a slight problem in face recognition and face unlock. Problem cannot be said, it is a bit slow though in low light.Face recognition works even in medium light, but yes there is a slight slowness and fingerprint is fine, very good, we cannot say amazing but very good. Camera quality is very strong, Samsung is mostly seen in its phones, it pays more attention to the display and operating system, but the camera quality in this phone is very good in the right and it gives good light even in low light and no doubt. The way to capture it is also very good. Selfie camera is different.The selfie camera is a great photo, and it seems that yes, we are using a very good quality camera, there is only 20 megapixel camera to see, but it is notless than the 32 megapixel camera of any other phone. Overall, the phone is very good, for ‚Çπ 14000, I just ordered one who had a little problem in the battery, I exchanged it and the battery gives a comfortable 2 days backup.

  I am writing this review after 24hrs of heavy useage ...As per battery performane is concern i will give it a 5 star ,it comes with a huge battery life ...If a tell abt the finger print sensor and face detection i will give it a 3 star as the detection is pretty much slow ...Resolution is quite good in this price range ...No lag till nw , i am a not ha heavy gamer so can't tell abt heavy game uses ..but samsung shld use a better processor, otherwise in this range this phone serves good ...The camera quality in day light id pretty good ,but the night resolution lags a bit ...If we see the pros and cons overall it a good one in this price range ...but if ur going on a high price range lk 17k to buy M31s i would refer u to buy other brands lk poco or motorola ...In this price range its a verry good phone ,no doubt.

  I'm posting my review after 1 week usage of my new Samsung M21 mobile. I took Mignight blue and it was awesome in design.Positives1. Display is simply good.2. The touch is very smooth and I liked the smoothness a lot.3. Battery is amazing even with 15% charging you can watch a movie for more than 1 hr easily.4. Sound quality is very good for people who love to listen songs without headsetsNegatives1. I'm not sure of high end games but the phone is having a slight lag. While using whatsapp the keypad got struck 2 times. I need to click on power button to turn screen of and turn on again2. The camera part is getting heated if you charge mobile and use it for any songs by placing display towards up and camera towards down.3. The finger print sensor isn't that great because sometimes it is unable to recognize.4. Charging takes time even though it is fast charging. But yeah it is 6000mAh I'm fine. But want to mention that charging takes some time.Overall above all negatives I mentioned. The mobile in this cost with the best spec is worth buying it. More over I enjoyed the touch performace of the screen and battery life. So I can say 3.5/5

  I received mobile on 24 August 2020.  New mobile touchpad, 1/2 cm from right hand side was not working. So screen keyboard was fully working only in one hand mode.Settings of apps, from star or three dot symbol, were not opened.In lockdown situation for network, purpose of buying not fulfilled.Now I rush to service center.This is my first Samsung for rashtrabhakti.If possible, kindly, always send fully checked and working product.Not sell, depending upon service centre.Now on 22.09.2020 (after 12 days on repeated calling), service center handed me a coupon (coupon dt 17.09.2020 to redeem within 90 days)  for searching another model phone from one shop to another,  at the mercy of shops. A pathetic situation.??!!..

  I HAVE BEEN USING THIS DEVICE FOR MORE THAN A WEEK NOW AND HERE IS WHAT I FEEL.HARDWARE/BUILT QUALITY: The body is made of plastic and is highly slippery. You better order a case with it than be sorry. The buttons function very well and the speakers are really good. Microphone is perfect. You get a triple slot which is nice as you can expand storage at any time. There are no major complaints about the hardware except for the fact that the earpiece could have been better(still not bad).  The best part is that there is no camera bump!üåüüåüüåüüåüSOFTWARE/UI:  M21 runs on One Ui 2.0 which is  really good and simple to use. The interface is user friendly and I especially liked it even though I was using stock android before buying this. There are a good number of features available which are ofcourse very handy.Talking about the processor(Exynos 9611), it does my job as I am not a gamer. It smoothly runs multiple applications and there are no heating issues whatsoever.Finger print sensor is well positioned and fast. Face unlock is too fast which is not good but you can change this in the settings. üåü üåü üåüüåü¬ΩCAMERA: The rear camera is quite good at this price point as it delivers high quality images at good lighting conditions. The quality of images in night conditions are not that good but you can't complaint much at this price, especially when you get a good number of modes in the app.  The selfie camera however is PATHETIC! The 20 MP sensor seems more like an old Nokia phone's sensor with zero detailing and bad colours. If you are selfie freak you better go for some other device as it severely underperforms. üåüüåüüåü ¬º( 3 for rear and ¬º for front).DISPLAY/SCREEN: The screen is a 6.4 inch super amoled display with 60hz refresh rate. Well I don't have to say anymore as you know that Samsung is at the top when it comes to display quality.üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüBATTERY: The battery is claimed to be a 6000mAh one by Samsung but it doesn't actually feel like a battery monster as it only gives you 15 hours of screen time in very normal usage. It feels more like a 4000mAh battery. The phone supports 15W fast charging which is slow. It takes more than one and half hours to change from zero to hundred.üåüüåüüåüOVERALL: I am satisfied with the product as per it's price and I am sure it is in the top 3 phones at this price range. Go for it if you are not a hardcore gamer or a selfie freak. You will be more than happy üòä.Hope this helps üôè.#boycottchineseproducts

  Although after using this device half month I m writing this review....I wll talk these in following points.1. About SECURITYit has got fingerprint .which is working accurately fast.also has  Face rcgntn.. which  is  great  doing its job well2.About DISPLAYas diplay is the in the main highlights of this. perfoming it's functions well .colours are too good to see.3.About looks and appearancelooks are great camera cutting is well finished .in appearance .like a soft (i.a.chiknaa) gadget. no hand pain while holding it even for long time.4.about CAMERA as camera is also in the highlight of this .its back cameras are doing its job well  good performance when shot on UHD mode.  selfies are also good but not well satisfied. Also it doesn't contains night mode .5 about BATTERY.also it is in highlight 6000mah battery going on and on for a day or even two days when used normally.I.e. viewing videos .phone calling.messaging another..but  when u turns for playing games like pubg it's going to be heated upwhich is bad .6 and last I don't know why this is a up while plugged In for charging ... adaptor and mobile set is heated up .In all these above I have concluded all informations .at last I want to say that if u are in need of a budget smartphone , which looks smarter performs well in camera .battery and display.No doubt it will be your good choice.You can gift this mobile to your parents...or loved ones...

  The phone is excellent. Perfectly worth for money.I have been using it since a week now, and believe me battery life is just amazing. You can easily use this phone for almost 2 days while using social media, attending meetings, some gaming. The phone charges also at a pretty fast rate.The display is ü§©, adaptive brightness of this device is the best by far. Full screen display is responsive to every 4 corners, you really get a full screen TOUCH.Fingerprint sensor also works perfectly, there is no lag.Camera quality is excellent, you get real images no unnecessary filters. The slow-mo videos are great. Front camera is also amazing.Samsung's One UI is great, you get to open links of meetings or anything else right from the notification bar. I had been using stock android and MIUI until now, but this shift just feels vary easy and much more comfortable.There's digital well-being included as well.There are no connectivity issues with WiFi/ Bluetooth either.I am using 4/64 variant and it is amazing.Just one drawback, that's the build quality. A back cover is must, rest everything as Samsung claims WattaMonster.

  I am putting my honest review. Samsung M21 has a very bad built quality. The soft plastic which acts like a cushion between the phones plastoc back and the screen has a very poor fit(See attached image). I ordered a replacement within few minutes after unboxing. The replacement unit has proper fittin but it still doesn't look good enough.Whoever bought this phone already check your phone. and the ones who are going to buy make sure you check each and every corner this phone.Most of the phones in the market provide a pre-applied scratch guard on the screen and a silicone case. This phone literally provides none of them. The phone does provide a good chipset, memory, screen, battery, camera etc.  Thumbs up to Samsung for this. But all these wont matter if the back plastic and the screen has visible gaps.CHECK YOUR M21 AFTER YOU PURCHASE IT.

  Dont buy this product from amazon, worst service, as mentioned in condition as 7 days replacement, but everytime amazon ask for try with diagnostic app, lots of battery issue and laging. In this range go with Mi or Realme. Never buy samsung product, dont go with brand, go with performance.

  Positive points :1. Display is awesome.2. smooth touch and simple UI which makes easy for navigation when it comes to usability in terms of 30+ apps.3. Camera is best with natural captures without artificial skin.4. Both biometric authentications are pretty fast.5. Ergonomic design so flexible for both and one hand handling.6. lightweight thought battery is 6k.7. Good performance on multiple applications.Offset points :1. No inbuilt security login feature for applications , though one can download samsung secure app. does the work.2. No feature available to hide the message preview for whatsapp and other social media apps on home screen notifications.3. Screenshot techniques are not use friendly. ( palm feature)Overall best mobile in budget ,off-set points can be worked on SOTA updates i believe.

  some items missed charge wire very small, u delivery with out head phone, not worth this price (Rs.15999) this mobile ,I tell u good but 20 days purchase after screen touch not working properly, hanging screen touch, did not return policyam not recommend this mobile,Price only high but not worth bad

  Worst experience for life time.. Phone got damage not working after 10 days no parts available in samsung.. They are now looking for some another solution... Don't ever think to buy this product. Also Amazon not provided the satisfactory support when a phone stop after 10 days without any physical damage.. Just disgusting these online shopping for electronic product.. Only better to buy some dustbin bags I prefer..

"
"

  Fingerprint Reader is OK,Battery Life is SUPER AWESOME,camera quality is decent,not too good not too bad,it's average,sometimes it struggles to focus, overall if you are a Media Consumer then it is for you but if you play games then pick other phones as this phone is not a well-performer in gaming,in day to day life is performs well as other phones.I would be more happy if SAMSUNG would provide a case and a tempered glass inside the box!Also SAMSUNG must improve the quality and length of the TYPE-C cable.Overall the phone is OK

"
"

  Performance Heaven!!M21 has the perfect camera, perfect AMOLED display(full brightness is best I've seen in phone under 15K).Near perfect fingerprint sensor(a bit slow sometimes)Just one cons for me, i.e, a battery of 6000 mah feels like 4000 mah after a day of heavy use.Also, I can do without unnecessary clutter of SAMSUNG apps. But, it's an easy fix as one can disable those apps.Just a nitpick but it matters.Otherwise, a very solid phone which Gives every other phone a run for its money!!And, I'm very happy with my purchase.

  I got the product yesterday. I am writing this after using for two days . The product is quite decent but the cost is little bigger .PROS-1. At first I will give 5 star to the immersive display , which is super amoled , it's changed my video experience . I watched a movie on 1080P resolution and it was so good,the quality of  Color , contrast, and brightness  made me  impressed.2. 2nd big thumbs up to its battery , as I am a heavy user , after charging it fully I used for 12 hours then it came to 18 , I watched two full hd movies, streamed YouTube for several hours and many more , really the battery made me stunt.üíó3. Camera is good , not so much , I was expecting a immersive camera but it is not  , in it's place it is quite good , I will give it 3/5. üôÉüôÉCONS -1. Now a days every company provides a tpu case which is missing here , Samsung should provide a tpu case for safety2. It has a heating issue , after using half an hour it became hot by normal usage , which is  not a good symptom at all .3. The processor is not so good , I observe frame drop issues  even on pubg mobile lite , temple run in this kind of game . When I was watching movie after 1 hour the video was getting paused,. I restarted it then it became alright .I got these points till now after using two days , if I got any issue I will update it very soon .Thank you

  Perfect for heavy ( in terms of time) mobile users. Battery lasts too long compared to other similar battery capacity phones. Finger print senser and fave detector have 80% efficiency, not 100% satisfactory in terms of processing speed. Great advance settings and extra features. Touch display is excellent. Screen brightness is perfect even in heavy sunlight conditions. Lot of additional features.Overall it's nice product in below 15k range.

  I bought this phone for my father... Due to COVID situation it took some days for me to reach home and give the phone to him. The phone is working fine except for connectivity issues... As users of Jio network I found it easy to connect to network with my Realme phone , while this M21 keeps on searching network and even if it gets connected it gives only a slow internet speed.. When I found this connectivity issue, I tried to return the phone to get refund and get some other brand, but I had this bad experience from Amazon of not giving refund saying I did not request for return within 7 days, though I tried to do that through the app unaware of Amazon's policy of not accepting refund request through the app . So I have no other option than to keep this phone.. Now I think had i bought this phone from a local store I could return it and take some other brand like Realme..

  please be careful while buying samsung M series phones , they are not testing their softwares properly before giving us an update. these phones get bricked after update and when we visit the service centre they will ask you to wait for one month saying that the motherboard needs to be replaced/repaired. these phones run on ONE UI Lite and the software has lot of bugs. dont just go on the camera and ui design, think about after sales service and think can you stay without the phone for 1 month if the phone bricks. The service centre guy has confirmed that he received more than 30 phones with such faults from m series, M30s,M31,M21.

  Best budget phone with best battery backup.1.Good Budget phone under 15k.2.Battery life is super,as it is only like 5500 mAh not 6000 mAh. power management is ok but not super. For normal usage like calls, Fb, Insta, YouTube and whatsapp it stands almost 2.5 days from 100 % to 5%. For gaming like PUBG it took 40 % after 3 classic match for me.3.Camera is just ok,need to improve pic quality not as expected.4.Display is the best thing in this phone,awesome  6.4 inch display and smooth handling.5.Performance is super for normal usage, i bought 6gb RAM device and it good for normal gaming not for heavy gaming. For pubg there are little lags,if you need better performance in PUBG you need to change graphics settings.6.So far i haven't felt any heat problem,i almost played pubg for 1 hr and also had call for 1 hr duration,no heating happened.7.Charging is not fast charging,they display as fast charge but not as like they mentioned. Type-C cable for charging and It took 3 hours for full charge from 4%. They provided only 10W charger not 15W.8. While coming to structure,it is made of plastic body. No backcase provided so you have to buy one immediately after buying the phone else scratches will happen. Overall rating will be 4.3,also good phone with affordable cost.

  My RatingsCamera: 4.8/5Performance: 4.4/5Battery: 4.3/5Display: 4.7/5My OpinionIt's been a week since I purchased the Samsung Galaxy m21 6GB 128GB.So far the phone has been really great.I do not experience any kind of lag in the phone however some can be noticed while playing High-End games like COD and PUBG.The Camera of the phone is amazing and captures stunning photos and its wide angle shots are like a premium phone.The Battery Life of the phone being 6000Mah is little effective as per me.I Charge the phone to 100 in early morning and use it all day without having charging breaks, then the cycle repeats.OF COURSE,the display being AMOLED shows vivid pictures that adds a little warmth to the picture which is soothing to the eye.My review for the phone is solid,and this phone for 16000inr is a great deal.

  Samsung M21 is best smartphone in this range and it's performance and quality is significantly different from other samsung smartphones. Before this, I was using Samsung's A30s which was more expensive than this one but if I compare both of these on a broader basis and can surely say that this one is way much better than that.It's battery life is very impressive, I am a very heavy user of this and it gives me around 1.5 days of phone not needing the charger. the best about this is that it charges very fast with it's 15W fast charger.Picture quality from it's 48 MP main camera is best in class. I will be attaching some of the pictures clicked by this you can a look at them.Over all phone using experience is also very nice as it comes with the Samsung's ONE UI. I am not a gamer so can't say about the performance of this phone while gaming and stuff. But I can guess that it will not be having any issue while doing heavy gaming, e.g., PUBG and all.But this device has some heating issues which is very common for M series smartphones, but I think by some updates and stuff Samsung will be working to resolve it.

  The display is awesome..Battery..life is good.fingerprint fast not very fast.Camera is decent....clicks good pictures in daylight...but in low light it would disappoint u a little.U will find boosted colours.Gcam doesn't  support...bcoz i had tested mabmny versions...it always  crashes..that's what  made me so disappointing....Games like pubg runs well...but it's not a phone for a gamer...slight gaming is bearable...Processor is decent..Network fetching capacity is a bit poor...but u will not feel any difference if u r connected  with stable high speed network...Triple card slot available..Buy case...or cover because u may get scratches due to plastic panel on the backside...Battery charging...speed is 2-2.5 hrs...(100% truth)No lag or hang issues...till nowHeats sometimes....but it happens with every smartphones...U can stream Amazon prime videos  and Netflix  very interestingly...Dual apps feature is available..but Gallery volt feature is missing...I am a user of m21...since 1 month...n feel satisfied to have it.

  After one month usage..I feel like a clear winner for choosing this phone over other brands. At first battery did not look like a monster as it was advertised. But after one month I can clearly see it lasts as it promised. I tried PUBG for more than a week..seems like the device handles it nicely.Display is the main part that needs special mention..Call quality is also good. Speaker volume at maximum is loud enough for a typical user.Camera did not disappoint..It performed at its best for my usage i.e.,mostly daylight clicks.Had to mention Fingerprint sensor..it does the job I think. But with the amount of hand sanitizing going on with today's trend..it failed me on a numerous occasions. But I am OK with it. By the way, not a fan of fingerprint sensor or any other such item if it's not perfect.I had a doubt whether Exynos 9611 would be enough or not before purchase. But I am more than happy with the overall performance it gave me.Do not let your phone get filled with junk files. Clean junk on regular intervals, keep monitoring background apps and unwanted permissions. Then this phone will start giving the best result.

  I am writing this review after using for about 9 days. At first,  i ordered the product and it got delivered within the promised time. But there was a woth the phone so i raised to replace the shipment and the product was replaced within 3 days. Now the phone which i got after replacement seems to have everything fine.Battery is really a moster.Display is also awsome.Fingerprint is okCamera very lovingSound quality also very good.I had already used redmi note 9 pro max but it was too bulky and heavy to carry also its display was not like m21.Samsung's display is also loving.I suggest to go for it if you want a quality display, monster battey, good camera from a reputed brand(SAMSUNG).

  Honest review ...1. The battery life is excellent here as promised . You get a two days battery backup which is jst awesome .2. Camera clicks brilliant photos . There's only one problem though , saturation is very high means if you click a yellow rose pick it may look like orange.3. The screen quality is exceptional ecxept sometimes due to the amoled display , however you may see pixels and fuzzy screen in night seen jst watch game of thrones season eight episode 2 and compare it with pocco X2 or moto fusion.4. User interface is very nice but if u r not a samsung user u might find the setup a bit odd and the android interface is not so much clean as seen in moto fusion.5. Touch response is very nice and the screen is a lot brighter, but ur finger will stick to the display in case u r not using temper glass.6. The phone is not a gaming phone but it will work very smooth in day to day use .In my opinion it's the best smartphone in this price range .... With brilliant features and amoled display

  I bought this phone for my wife exchanging of Redmi Note 4 (superb product worked for almost 4 1/2 years)... till the exchange period window it was ok but after that the real face of the product could be seen. From 12th day onwards - What‚Äôs app was reinstated after 4 attempts, phone did not receive proper signal for couple of days after that did software update then it was OK for few days and from yesterday touch screen stopped working... I lost my 13k for this cheap phone. I realised why Apple phones are too good (even though it is slightly above priced) it is worth investing coz they maintain such high standards... Finally do not buy this cheap phone guys..üò£

  Phone is good but the major issue I am facing from very first day the network issue during phone calls. The caller voice is not coming properly due to disturbance, means unable to understand what the opposite caller is speaking, and obviously your voice is not reaching to your caller properly. I went to Samsung customer service, they also face the problem and said to me software will be going to update. After updating it, voice problem solved but after two days usage of mobile phone, I was facing same problem, I recorded the calls. Again I went to customer service, now they are saying we haven't  face any kind of as problem. So before purchasing think a phone without calling option of no use. 1 star of calling or network problem.

  Over my expectations and Samsung did the job of camera quality its extremely Satisfied in this price range and display is 10/10.A little dissatisfaction is always that Samsung does not provide the silicon cover which is not good because first of all you need to order cover in order to save the phone and display.

  I got this product in my hands on 13th July and here's my review after more than 15 days of usage.1) Weight distribution: The first thing I noticed was the weight distribution. After holding the phone, it doesn't feel like the phone has got a massive 6000 mah battery.2) Battery optimization: The battery optimization on this phone is awesome as well. I don't have any complaints in that regard. I use this phone extensively for 8-10 hours a day on 4G and the phone lasted for about 30 hours on a single charge.3) Camera: The camera quality is also better than comparable smartphones in the same price bracket.4) Call and signal quality: The audio during the call was good and both the parties did not have anything to complain about the call quality. And the signal reception is good as well. (PS: I use jio)5) Performance: The precessor handles day to day tasks pretty well without any lag. I'm not a gamer so I don't have much idea about gaming. But for someone who wants to play some moderately heave games, I think the phone should be fine.Hope this review is helpful to any potential buyers. :)

  Received the phone just today, I might change my review depending on my experience in the coming days!On the first day, everything looks great! Battery charged to 100% in 2 hours and 45 minutes. Camera, Display, Performance all seem to be good so far!Samsung tried to deliver the best value in this price range. For sure, you cannot compare this with a Rs.50000 or a 25000 Rs. phone; you get what you pay for.Kudos to Samsung and Amazon! (Buyers, I have no stakes with either company, but this is truly a good product targetted on an average Indian user. Buy with confidence)!

  The selling point of Samsung Galaxy M21 for me was its 6000 mAh battery. I purchased this phone hoping to get a lot out of the monster battery of this phone. Today (17/08/2020) I was vindicated. I usually charge my phone in office and take the charger with me every day to office.Today when I reached office, I noticed that I had forgotten the charger at home. My phone was at 20% charge at that time. No one else in my office had type C charger. I was angry at myself for forgetting the charger. I was sure my phone's battery would die before midday. I couldn't just switch off my phone to conserve battery as I had to attend calls and use internet during the day.I used the phone moderately today (making and attending a lot of phone calls, browsing internet etc.) and the battery didn't die. When I reached home in the evening, 3% charge was still left. Only 17% charge was used by the phone in 9 hours. This phone has got a really monster battery. If you are solely looking for a phone with good battery life, don't look any further.

  This is First time while I am using Samsung mobile  and I am so glad I decided to buy that mobile... I am really very much satisfied with this product & now I decided in future I will buy only Samsung mobile Now I am giving  my feedbackOn that mobile in points :-1.) Its camera quality is really too good in this price range2.) Battery life is also soo awesome .... I am taking some online  classes  so because  of that I need that mobile which work all day long I am watching videos upto 16hr & even I never feel any such type of heating even after using that much there having 30 to 40 % battery left3.) I love focus mode in this mobile which help me to focus on my work4.) Fingerprint reader work really good & it respond frequently5.) I am not getting  any lag or hang problem in this phone upto that time6.) I don't know why people not like its back side but I loved it its show simple & shower look which I loved alot

  The phone has everything to make u like it.1.Talking about camera  not it clicks good pictures, but also has options like slomo , superslomo which I love the most. Camera quality for this price rage is also decent.2. Battery life is also great, during this quarantine time,  all we do is use phone for online studies and video calls and conferencing. Still it last throughout the day. Nd if u r a medium or less user of phone it will last for 2 3 days with active use.  6000mah battery does it's work.3. Fingerprint reader and face unlock also works great. As more time, with active usuage and updates it got more fluent.4. Talking of features so it provides, so it does provides good amt of features. If you were a chinese phone user like mi oppo vivo and all, you won't all its features in this phone. Gestures, data savers,  permission handling, very versatile gallery and file handlers does a great job.5. Doesn't hang while playing games like pubg and all...Over, it's a great phone. Must buy. Value for money

  I was searching for non-Chinese phone. Samsung is a  trustworthy brand we can say best to fit now. Galaxy M 21 has a fantastic crstal clear super AMOLED screen. This crystal clear Big 6.4 screen is enough to get a cinematic view . Giant Battery can use 1.5 days for a normal user. Unlike Chinese brands, Samsung phones have very little SAR value that many people won't care about, but is a very important factor that everybody should concern if they wish to care for their health. Chinese brands have very high SAR values and that radiation can harm ur health. So if you want a branded phone with the best specifications, the best screen, good camera, but with a budget less than 14-16 thousand, then go for Samsung M21 ....it is the best in this price range!.

  Received the product in 14 days as the pandemic was on peak tht time. Initially the battery was performing worse i must say. I was almost going to contact Amazon for a replacement but I thought let's just give it few days, it begins to work properly and now easily i can get a whole day battery life and still some juice remaining for next day. Camera quality is good, not excellent or equivalent to those beauty plus cameras of Chinese brands but if you know how to click a picture it will not disappoint you. Charging speed is slow as massive battery is being charged on such a small brick. Overall build quality is good could have been better. Would update as i am using it.

  I liked the camera quality , I could catch each and every detail in closeup and the zoom is good too..But after a week of purchase , the phone started to lag little bit and because of it ,I didn't download many games hoping it would become worse...The battery life is also good ...The phone has pretty good user interface..It feels really comfortable to hold and also use with single hand...The performance would be much better if I wouldn't experience any lag while using and while switching windows. I don't think this phone has good screen protection, so better buy a good quality tempered glass.Overall the phone for such less and good price, is worth buying.üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ

  Great mobile phone for best price.I recommend this. Samsung always best. Dolby Atmos awesome experience and camera quality is good..... battery life is better than all other products.......so I suggest Samsung m21...Design - Subjective(I liked it).Build - Sturdy (but using back case and tempered glass suggested)Battery - 6000Mah around 2 days of battery life and charge time is around 2hrs 30mins if 10% battery left.Camera - Shots are well captured and image processing is good. End result is appreciable.Screen Quality - It's Samsung, need not worry about display. Good colour reproduction in SAMOLED. Nice touch response.Processor - Exynos 9611, this is pretty capable of handling almost every task u throw at it. But don't expect heavy gaming like Snapdragon 800 series. Exynos 9611 is similar to Snapdragon 730.OS - Snappy and didn't face any lags.Network reception - Didn't face any issue with BSNL, Wifi..etc.Audio output - Loud enough in the budget range(around 17k).

  This a great phone in a low budget range. I was searching for a non Chinese company and m21 is perfect.  The camera is good.  I am posting two images taken with the phone camera one in bright sun light another in low light, both the images are carrying same quality. I used to attend video Conferences call using Google meets, MS teams, zoom etc using the phone all of them works smoothly. I am not a video game player but a heavy user of many complex apps. Almost 50 apps are installed on my phone and it works smoothly.The touchscreen,  sensor and battery are good.

"
"

  After using 1 month of M21, I am satisfied with all aspect of this mobile that includes battery life, speed of functioning, sensor working etc.One more thing is that I had ordered VIVO but due to lockdown it was delayed and then I decide to cancel it due to boycott made in China product, and I think that was my great decision because this mobile is too better than Vivo at this price range.#boycottmadeinchina

  Best budget killer mobile from the premium brandDisplay is awesome. Thanks for bringing the sAMOLED screen to the budget category.Power packed battery (6000 mAh) with ideal weight management. Device is not feeling heavy while handling.2 days battery life for the moderate usage.RAM Management is too good and the app switching is smooth.Rear Camera is stunning and Front camera is too good for selfies.5 Star performance for the price.Only improvement I can recommend is the build quality and appearance.

  Like1. Display2. Sounds with equalizer3. Regular app performance very well.4. Camera performance very well.5. Battery backup is also very well.Dislike1. Heating issue on 5 to 10min usage with YouTube watching. Heat is getting arise around fingerprint area.2. Network reception is not good, which is vital part of a smartphone.

  I checked the available option in market and found this Samsung M21 6GB+128GB the best as per my uses. Although it took 20 days to get the delivery from Amazon even after being the Prime member. At the time I open the box, It is as good product as was my search.Quality, In hand feel & Display is the USP. Its a Value for money product. One who like good display, Long battery life with brand name, would easily choose this. Even the camera quality is amazed me. I was not expecting that crisp images from its camera, specially selfies are amazing.

  I bought the midnight blue, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my friend. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my friend is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my friend are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my friend  was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI.-The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro.-The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short.- The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are ahardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well.-The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours.- The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output.- The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos.- The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face.Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer.  Thanks for reading

  If you want a mobile which value for money and performs well in your day to day life then go for it.At this price your are getting  super Amoled display with 6000 mAh battery.Camera is very Good no doubt And very important thing is its UI.UI -->Samsung UI is far better it does not gives you unwanted advertisement & notifications. It is very smooth. And easily customizable.I was having doubt about its processor but now i am using it and i didn't faced any issue till now.Processor is good at this price. Even Samsung gives same processor for the phones which is priced much higher than this phone.Only one problem is Slow Charging --„Äãthat can be solved by charging at night while you are sleeping. It has a huge capacity cell 6000 mAh it takes time to charge if you are charging from 0 to 100% but it gives you very long battery backup. I am using it normally and its battery lasts for two days.Slow charging is not a big issue. Because in single day only 50% (aprox) battery is used that is easily charged don't forget it is 6000 mAh.

  Samsung galaxy M21 is really a monster . At this price segment,  I must say Samsung you nailed it.There is nothing as such in this phone which I dont like .Display quality (Samoled ) just loved it üòç, finger print scanner and face unlock is quite fast , Camera quality is just great . The brightness of the phone due to its samoled display is just fantastic .Battery life is superb . Though there is a 15W adaptive fast charger inside the box , it still takes easily around 2:30-2:40 hrs to get fully charged from 0 -100%.Though we shouldn't forget that the battery of Samsung galaxy M21 is 6000 mah.I have attached few samples of the shots which I took from this phone .Regarding Pubg well I dont play Pubg but yes this phone can play Pubg very well.Overall a very nice phone from Samsung and that too under 13k which actually really surprised me.

  It has an AMAZING 6.4 inch FHD+ AMOLED Display, which is best in this price segment of 14k.Morovere, it is a SAMSUNG phone which many would like.It has one of the best UI ONE UI 2.0, which is amazing wih a minimal Bloatware and ads. But there are some app recommendations.The CAMERA is ABOVE AVERAGE. Don't expect too much on Camera. And it is not meant for a camera eccentric person.The EXYNOS 9611 which is a 12 nm fabricated processor is a good one compared to other samsung phones like A21s and many others comparing the price. But it cannot compete Snapdragon 720/730 G processors. It can easily handle day to day tasks without any isssue.You can play Casual games without any issues.This phone is not meant for heavy gamers, but it can run games like PUBG Moblie smoothly on low settings.I didn't notice any overheating issues.And, cthe 6000 mAh BATTERY is AMAZING! You will get anywhere between 10- 12 hours of SOT.The weight balance done is good.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR:Your PARENTSAnd for Moderate users.Buy this phone if your main priority is not HEAVY GAMING.NOTE :This phone(M21) is more value for money than M31.

  M21 is best phone for normal user because of its battery and performance, it's lack in gaming dosen't give smooth performance in long game play ,you can do normal gaming but it will be not the best choice for gaming in this price ,Some prose aredisplay is superb you will get very premium experience2 it's camera is best in this price segment3. Battery is outside, you can easily get 18 hours of screen on in moderate use and in heavy 13-14 hours of screen on time and it's also dependent on your usage pattern.4.one ui is extremely smooth and clean5.weight distribution is very good ,you will not feel pain in your hand .Cons are1.signel strength is very poor ,you will face network issue in area where the network is low .2.built quality is poor scratch easily come in back panel if you don't use back cover3.there is no in built network speed meter4.while reading book pdf screen sensitivity become very less and you can also find problem in scrolling pages .5.fingur print sensor dosen't work properly many time .

  The pros:1. Incredible display. Very vibrant and very clear. Touch is very responsive and it's perfect for multimedia.2. Long lasting battery life. Goes a day and half without charge even when practically using the phone all the time.3. Camera is very nice. Videos are great. The extra features like Slow-mo, hyperlapse, wide angle are all present and they work decently well.4. Processor is good enough to run multiple apps in the background and not have your app crashing when you need it most.Cons:1. The build quality isn't too great. But once you put on a cover, it doesn't even matter.2. I'm not a gamer, but I feel like it's not really meant for heavy apps. They will work but just not seamlessly like most would want.But for this price, I'd highly recommend it. I feel like for my day to day life, it comes in handy. I don't like putting my phone down to charge frequently. I now do only once in two days (for more than an hour of course).

  Awesome product, value for money. At 16K, you are getting 6GB RAM and 128 GB primary memory. After a full charge, my phone took 2 days to drain the battery to 20% after heavy usage (4G on continuously). Work flawlessly, multiple apps are running simultaneously smoothly, no hang at all. Playing 1080P movies beautifully. Camera is OK for me. Fingerprint reader is excellent. Hotspot speed is amazing. Fast charging. It takes 40 min for a charge from 10% to 90%. Above all, it is manufactured in India. In my review, it's  a beast. Go for it without any further doubt.

  Samsung M21 #whatta monster...Simply superb, its my 3rd Samsung phone. It is rivalry for its own brands such as M31, M30s, M30 for the aggressive pricing and same features.Well my honest review after the use,1. Battery is outstanding with 6000mah comes around 3 days life with normal use and charging takes around 2 hr 20 min to full charge.2. 48MP camera is good but default camera settings 16:9 resolution pictures are better than 48mp pics, wide angle and bokeh affects are ok. Selfie camera is good as it feels like A71.3. Phone have super slow motion, slow motion, night mode and hyperlapse options well thats good addition for the price range.4. With good exynos processor no lag with using applications, its very smooth, games runs smoothly no lags at all.5. It has video stabilization option by default and it has additional super study video option for better video recording.6. Loudspeaker is ok ok may be after updates it can improve.7. Automatic brightness control or virtual light sensor is not ok....some times under normal light it will be overbright and in dark somes times it works well but all the time u should manually fix the brightness, may be this area should be fixed.8. No secure folder and kids home option.Overall Android 10 with One UI 2, simply superb for the price range....simply go for it.

  Bought this for my father. Has been using it for past 4 days and i want to share my review:1. Body: Full Polycarbonate body. which is harder than Ordinary plastic and glass.2. Screen: Absolutely good.3. F.P: It is really fast.4. Camera: Selfie camera quality is too good and 48MP main camera is also good in quality. But, when you tried Wide angle camera, I found bit noise and less quality in pic.5. Battery: 6000mah is deffinetly heavy for parents. It is giving a day backup with less than 40% battery use. Battery backup is really good. But, Charging time is between 2 hr 30 mins to 3 hrs. Battery is huge, but nearly 3 hrs for charging is tough while travelling.6. Speaker: Output is good. But, Sound quality at full sound is bit less.7. Sim Tray: Yes, no one will speak about this. But, yes I found the sim tray is very delicate. I can compare it with other brands and other mobiles of samsung, yet i can say sim tray is very delicate. I worried it might break in my hands. So, frequently removing it is not a good Idea.8. UI: I am always a fan of Samsung UI. Yes, Samsung didn't disappointed us now even.9. Face Unlock: It is ok. Just like all the budget Android mobiles.10: Yes, I felt heat sometimes while charging or while using.Hope, it is helpful for you.

  Iam a midle salaried person and i always buy phone under 15000 and i look always better option for this rate.i used Lumia and HTC and redmi and after i using redmi feel that its the better phone under 15000. And when my phone get complint i search for redmi phones to buy.  But one of my friend said that there is a good phone in samsung and i search got this model M21 6000 MH bettery at 13999 there is not any other better option and i baught this.  And when i got this i understand that the phone is too good than redmi. The touch is so smooth and finger print responding than redmi, the main feature is Display colour its super i love it. Camera also not bad worth for this rate frond camera is super.and i can use Two 4G sim card and memmory card. So i give full rating for this phone becouse its samsung and there is no hanging problem and the features are totaly changed. No advertisement  redmi users know there are lot advertisement in redmi software. If you want to by a good phone on this rate you can choose this. And its made in india not in chinaüòç

  This smartphone is one of the best budget phone with a beast all round performanceCamera quality is excellent with a triple camera combination it provides variety of options, well optimized and no flaws at allBattery life is the best in this device with 6000 mAh but the thing is that it will easily take a 2-2.5 hrs to go from 0% to 95-100% while charging.Design of this phone is good, it will give you a solid premium feel in your hand. Fingerprint sensor is also a good one and its face recognition is very much accurate. No issues in security of this phone at all.Performance is the most important thing here, this device performs very well in every field like gaming, multimedia, camera, web browsing and all but it is not the best in this range. Not recommended for pro gamers.Display in samsung devices is not a question at all with a bright colourful and  great screen size sAmoled display you can have a great experience. No heating issues, clean user interface, one ui 2 with no bloatware.

  As it comee as the successor of M20. I was vary eager to buy the smartphones as soon as released. Now i have used for 3 months exactly. Its feels good and the main quality i observe is that, the phones is not getting heated up . Thats an outstanding performances it gives. When comes with camera, daylight photograph are awesome but the scene optimiser isn't as responsive. Overall camera good.  Battery life for the Galaxy M21 was excellent. Thanks to the big 6,000mAh battery the phone lasted us for close to two full days of regular use. The lower price and the better chance of getting updated to Android 11 at some point tip the scales in the Galaxy M21's favour.  Performance was smooth. The fingerprint scanner at the back of the device is quick to unlock the device. Multitasking was smooth and we could switch between multiple apps without needing to wait for them to load all over again.Overall my opinion, Awesome galaxy phone with execellent features at low budget

  I have purchased a samsung m21 mobile from Amazon with no cost emi 4666 p.m. emi with three installment. From my card there is 13698 credit limit decreased. When statement generate there was interested amount added in statement of rs 159. Why this amount added in this no cost emi statement. And after it due to your interest amount credit limit existed. So there is another charge of credid card. Hidden charges are applicable on

  This is the first time I purchased Samsung Galaxy handset. Product is quite awesome with the latest version.Battery is good enough  and took almost two hours for complete charging.I think this is good budget phone.Other tech features are as mentioned in the technical details.

"
"

  Would have given it four stars but despite taking 6GB version, the phone is sometimes sluggish even when trying to simply scroll through a list of apps on playstore, forget about gaming. Would have given it five stars if it would not have been sluggish and price would have been lesser than Rs15999.

"
"

  First thing is after unboxing the phone looks like it is used by someone, while switching on the phone not opened, I charged for 2 hrs and opened its finally opened, then after 15 days iam writing review, the phone especially not for gamers , I bought for my dad for 13999 price this mobile, camera is quite good and battery also ok, not high end performance and screen is excellent, it's samoled display you love with Netflix videos and upto now no problem,will see what happens in future.Decent price with decent feautres......

  I am writing this review after 30 day use.Pros of this mobile are:It's UI is very easy and nice to use.Screen is super amoled which is really very good and give you you a good experience.There are no ads which you might face on other mobiles.Battery life is very good it can easily last you 1 to 2 days of normal use. Memory management is very good and there are some good features in settings which make this mobile more useful.Cons:It usually heat up little bit when put on charge.Camera quality is not good in low light.Network connectivity is not good as compared to other mobile phones.There is no Samsung KNOX and secure folder which was there in earlier Samsung devices.Face unlock is also not as fast when compared to the mobiles.Photo image size when clicked with 48 megapixel is very large.Videos are not compressed nicely so so their size is also very big when we should in ultra HD mode.You can find some lags when clicking photos.Overall this mobile is very good value for money. These are some issues which might not bother you.Thank you...!!

  Phone is great and has many features but its exact copy of M30s with little edge over it. And the two things that give it an advantage over M30s is its selfie camera and default updated OS Android 10. Great phone to buy.  Only drawback,  it doesn't comes with any offer. You will get it at MRP.

  5/5 - Battery Life. As a normal user, the charge last for two days.5/5 - HD Amoled display. Super crisp and sharp with perfect color5/5 - Assiative touch like in iPhone, very handy in navigating5/5 - As I am an average user, Processing speed is good5/5 - Back Camera; 4/5 - Front CameraValue for the money!

  This takes 8 hours to charging......I want to replace this item....Fingerprint ok,camera not good,battery life is very best but charging time is too lateI want to replace this item....but amazon didn't  responding.....Anyone please help me....

  The best device I have ever bought..Highly recommended for everyone..Moster battery life upto 2days..Camera is superb..SAmoled display is marvellous..All over all features makes this device perfect in this price..Dolby Atmos support makes sound quality very good..Now,you grab it or loose it...It's your choice..Thanks Amazon for delivery in time..Thanks Samsung for this device..

  I was really skeptical switching to Samsung M21 as in the budget phone range as my prior experience with its performance and battery life was horrible. But this one had a huge battery and good ram so those problems were least to bother when I opted for it.So far everything looks OK but seriously the fingerprint touch is so bad üëé a big thumb down. Rest speaking about its overall performance, then it is just as expected not bad nor super cool. But if someone asks me if I would opt to buy another Samsung piece in future my answer would be a big no. MI anytime beats the performance overall.

"
"

  As usual samsung never give a chance to regret. I am writing this review after 2 month use. Here are my reasons to like the phone.1. When you unbox it, the look is model is really royal. Its very slim and look professional in hands.2. I got 6 GB ram with allow me install many apps. Currently I have installed 75 app still phone is working without getting any problem3. The 48 MP camera is the very good.4. 6000 mah battery is enough to work for 2 days with all time internet connectivity.5. This model have enhanced the quality of finger print sensor.I got this phone 15999 with is reasonable price for these features.

"
"

  I'm really glad I bought the Samsung Galaxy M21. This phone has the perfect combination of the right price and the best features.The most amazing part about this phone is the battery, I use it for streaming videos, music and other regular things yet the phone survives for two whole days without any charging.The camera is simply outstanding. I've captured some beautiful portrait shots with the 48mp camera. The front camera does a great job too.The fingerprint sensor is very quick to act provided your fingers are clean. I prefer to use the face detection feature which unlocks the phone instantly within milliseconds.The audio output via the bottom-firing speaker is pretty loud and the quality is great.The AMOLED display is honestly brilliant and HD support on streaming services is an added advantage.The OneUI 2.0 software is feature rich, well laid out and user friendly.The only con I have experienced is the charging time which doesn't matter much given the battery life.

  Review after 30 Day.. Battery :- as samsung says monsterTwo day battery standby for normal easyDisplay:- superbSuper amaload with full hd.. Superb DisplayIn sunlight ist not so brightCamera:Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low.. many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.. but in pro mode there are no option for sutter speed and manual focus, as well as in night mode u can not click picture with long Sutter, hope they add function in updateFinger print reader and face lock 3/5Face lock and finger print reader are not so fastCharging :No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 2:30 Hrs to fully reacharge the phoneBt after fully charge you do not needd to worry about battery you can easily spend your dayIf you are not a heavy gamer and you usually play games for one hour continuously at this price Its the best choice

  This is a very fantastic phone ...build quality though is plastic but looks very premium....processor superfast  handles daily tasks efficiently and pubg and other heavy games runs smoothly....Now coming to the best part ...its camera it AWESOME CAMERA  shaandar  jabardast pura monster....SAmoled  screen looks sexy and brilliant viewing angles vivid display ....battery also a marathon and though 6000 it slighlty underperforms  maybe due to some settings or new phone ..it takes time to callibrate ....Fingerprint reader and face lock fast...And also the UI is very clean with very less advts...And overall its Samsung guys and surprisingly doesn't hang...! Best purchase under 15k 4/64

  I have purchased this phone during lockdown when delivery was started in Green zone and received it before expected time. Now I have used it for more than one week. I can assure everyone that you can't get a phone similar to this in this price because from 1st April 2020 gst has been increased on mobile phones even though Samsung has decreased its price.Now how is it working?It has huge 6000 mAh battery which is really huge. I am writing the review at 10 PM today with 40 % battery and I charged it yesterday 2 PM and I'm using it continuously.It has 48 mega pixels camera but you can not get the same photo in other brands having 64 mega pixels camera.No other brands have sAmoled display in this price so no one will have any doubt about its display.Fingerprint sensor, face recognition is really faster than others.These above-mentioned things are exceptional but it doesn't mean all other things are not good. It's over all a very good phone.The only one thing is disappointing me is fast charger is not as fast as it should be, but I have no complaint because is has huge battery so it will take some time.Thanks for reading.

  Yes there is many competition at this price range , m21 gives the best display and I enjoy my entertainment in this phone,battery life is great though it takes up time to charge the phone . I do gaming but the phone is not for especially pubg long time ,but it can handle games Ive  played many games and the battery is great .No issues faced till now .Camera is good.Display is great.Battery is good.If ur looking at the battery and thinking u can play intensive gaming ,no man it's not for u because after a time the game (Ive tested pubg) is not as smooth as uve started playing( after an hour or after 4 to 5 successful matches in pubg at smooth extreme/ultra) the games is not that smooth as I've started to play . The phone gets warm after some gaming and heavy task not that much of an overheating issue.The phone almost fulfils it's purpose at the price range.Suggested for people who needs a decent phone at this price,Except intensive gaming ,the phone have many other pros .

"
"

  Pros - Great battery life. 10h of SOT can be easily achieved,  Great software experience, One UI is smooth, everything is fast due to ufs 2.1 storage ot july patch the day I received the phone from amazon. Both the front and rear cameras are great in daylight. Super amoled display at this price point is unimaginable. Sound quality through the headphone jack is good.Cons - Build quality could be better. Rear plastic feels less premium. Camera in low light needs improvement through software update. Loudspeaker feels a bit tiny. I don't have time to play games so can not say anything about gaming performance, but it should run pubg fine.One thing I like about this phone is that it contains everything I need for my daily usage. No gimmicks are present. Everything here is utilitarian.

  I had used Redmi and Vivo brands before M21 but the battery life, camera, biometric & fingerprint sensor were very good.  M21 lacks it.  Had not used Samsung since many years hence thought of buying this time. I am greatly disappointed!Samsung should work aggressively to bring on par their mobiles with the other South East Asia mobile companies.The inbuilt call recording option doesn‚Äôt work properly. It records only sometimes.  Shockingly it doesn‚Äôt have an inbuilt music player.  One is forced to download the online apps or YT app etc‚Ä¶ This is no good.  I feel cheated‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

  It's one of the best phones in its price segment-Best Battery-9 hrs screen on timeBest Display-sAMOLED FHD+Panel with Always on DisplayOne of the best CameraDecent Processor since I bought it for my Mom who does not do Gaming-So runs very smooth in daily lifeBest UI-ONE UI2.0 is packed with features& it is completely manufactured in India+Samsung has best service in India

  Have been using this phone for 2 months now.Always had a doubt before buying a samsung phone because I thought it's midrange phones hang a lot.But this one just works amazingly.Pros:Battery life is pretty amazing for the prizeHas amazing picture quality, the contrasts are real goodDoesn't hang as formerly thought by meHas a fast processorDoesn't heat up even after hours of gaming or moviesCons:Face recognition is slow and even with the fingerprint lock there's a lagVideo quality is not good, too much disturbanceDoesn't have a screen recorder!Overall given the price and the features available it's definitely worth the money!

  I had purchased Samsung galaxy M21 on 25th June 2020 through Amazon and last night i have start getting problems in screen i have touch somewhere and open something else, in just few days i had used this phone and getting problems what can I expect then? I have listened good reviews in market about this handset but after i have using it i have doubts now. I‚Äôm first time user specially Samsung device but not satisfactory with this handset.

  1) Sound 4/5, Looks 5/5, Camera quality 2/5.2) When i bought it was a No cost EMI. Today i receive an SMS from SBI: Your EMI Booking amount of Rs.11143.69 (due to exchange of old mobile) at Amazon4 is converted to 6 EMI's at 14% reducing rate of interest...which should not have happened.

  After 12 days of usage I am writing my review.I am a heavy user. I play pubg and always remain active on social media sites and never felt any type of problem in this device. I noticed that it took about 2.5 hours to be completely charged but it's battery (OMG). For a normal user it can easily lasts for more than two days. But if you play pubg nonstop then it will give you a backup of upto 7.5 hours.And about its performance, it can play pubg on ""HDR graphics + Ultra frame rate"" without feeling any big lagg. But you may get better gaming experience as compare to this and on same price. If your main priority is gaming only then you should go for any other phone. But keep it in mind that you can get better fps in realme or redmi mobile but can't get as much better viewing experience as much you will get on it.And its sAMOLED display gives a really very better viewing experience that you can't get in any other phone at this price.If you want a perfect allrounder with all other specs too, including gaming then SAMSUNG M21 is the right choice.Just go for it‚úå‚úå

  The phone is good in all aspects except for the cameras.Pros:1. Display is good2. Battery is good3. Faster responseCons:1. Camera is poor.- Photos are good when it is taken without even a slight shake. Image stabilization is poor. Video is worst in mild lighting. The video becomes blurry when you move the camera or the subject moves.

"
"

  Very poor network reception, compared it with one plus 5, iphone, jio lyf ( 5 + years old). If you live in signal poor area , not recommended. I had similar issue with m30 as well. So its not the issue with just my phone I believe.Camera good for this price range, no gitches while using. The best part is screen both on paper and in reality.  Battery life quite good but compromised by network reception issue. Improved UI response.

"
"

  I bought this on June14 2020 and within a one month of period it got hang frequently and then autometically restarted. Out of 64 gb memory only 20 gb is occupied but still there is a issue, dont know why it is happening. Never expected this from Samsung. I am very much worried about this and also it would be a huge disappointent if I need to go to the service center within one month of purchasing.

"

  This product is a excellent in a economical price range with a world class brandname. Though it is cheaper , you will never feel it rather u start using M series phone. It has a wonderful touchscreen display And mind Blowing picture taking capabilities. I have been using iphone X and due to its battery capacity,  I m looking for other phone which has good speed, data storage capacity and healthy battery life which all needs are accommodated in dis Phone. And i hv started using more M21 rather Iphone X.I have been suggesting you go for it without any more research and i am assuring you that you will never regret for it!üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

  I have always thought as if Samsung doesn't have any good mobiles below 20000. My family didn't had that good experience previously buying a budget Samsung handset. So I was always sceptical about buying Samsung phones.So now in this lockdown, as I had freetime and was planning to buy a new smartphone. I thought to read about Samsung's offerings as well. After a thorough research, I shortlisted three phones of three different companies having similar specs and under 15000. Though Samsung was priced a bit higher than its Chinese competitors, I got a gut feeling to go with M21.Its been 2 weeks now and I am really happy with my decision. The phone is amazing, not going in details about the technicalities but I must say this is the best performing phone in this category and budget. I have never been more satisfied using a phone. I'm in just love with every feature that this phone offers.I would like to recommend this phone to all those who are in plans of buying a top class phone under 15000/-

"
"

  It is better to buy samsung than any other device...The battery life is really nice...It comes with 6000 mAh battery.... But the most interesting fact is when you charge your phone it doesn't become hot.... And you can use your phone for 2 days (if fully charged) and yes not only the battery but most I like was the value for money...not costly, under budget , first I was told to buy an iphone but when I the reviews and details about galaxy m21 I was just like why to buy a costly phone when you are getting the best under 15000... One thing I also liked was the device never becomes hot even at the time of charging or when you are using it... My suggestion would be go for it and grab it before it goes...

  ¬†It has a major network issue ...The screen starts flickering on few websites ,Have finally requested for replacement.I think Samsung has no focus on quality of low end mobiles like m series.Refer video for checking the issue ...Thanks amazon for the amazing customer service

  Review after 10days of use:For pros u can go for most of the comments..I m gonna tell u some cons that only few will notice1. Phone gets heatup during gaming(pubg)2. Battry drains fast even after u r not using much apps3. Chrging takes approx 2.5 hrs from 0 to 1004. Speaker is below the mobile(i prefer it at the backside) because when u play games or stream videos..u unknowingly put finger on speaker which disrupts audio5. Audio jack is below( i find it uneasy to plug in wiredheadsets and  play pubg..it must b on the top)6. I dont know why my network speed reduced so much in this phone..4g is like impossible..i am using 3g to stream videos without buffer..i used to ise mi phone which generally gave speed upto 4mbps but in this it rarely reaches 1mbps)7. I used to play fm on mi phone through bluetooth speaker but i cant do the same with this phone..fm is played either on earplugs or phone's speaker( bluetooth speaker doesnt work for fm radio)Hope these reviews helpüòÑ

  Arrived 2 days after order placement. Perfect condition. The camera is awesome - night feature, live focus, and super slow motion features just make it indispensable.The battery life is also up to the mark. I charged it fully on the first day's evening. Attended video calls, normal calls (for hours), played games along with ongoing WhatsApp call, listened to songs for about an hour, and on the morning of the third day the battery was 50 percent.I'm fully satisfied with the processor speed. Exynos 9611 is slightly better than snapdragon 675.And the most stunning thing is the music quality while listening songs on spotify and wearing Samsung earphones. It's just the BEST!I would highly recommend this phone. What with the boycott of Chinese products, this is the perfect and the best choice for all age groups.

  Blucky (may be due to big battery) and plasticky,need improvement in build quality,the screen contrast is vivid and excellent,am new to sAmold,the colors are unnatural,especially looking at red objects like YouTube logo.watching Netflix was fantastic,wishing a metal back as in my old honor 7x or mi a1.Update:Fast charging not working,taking about 5 hrs to get fully charged,same complaint from many customers in samsung form.

  First of all, Thanks to Amazon for quick and timely delivery.. I have been using this phone samsung galaxy M21 for past 10 days.. features and specs you can check out on description page.. I will talk about how I felt about those features..1) 6 gb ram nd 128 gb storage - phone is pretty fast and does not get slow even after opening so many apps.. memory management is nice.. 128 gb memory seems sufficient.. no problem in this area..2) Display - display is very clear and crisp.. brightness is nice and screen can be visualised clearly in bright sunlight too..3) call quality - HD calling support gives very clear voice but it also depends on the network signal..4) Camera quality - nice camera for casual use.. I will give this camera 7 out of 10..5) Fingerprint sensor and face unlock - this is an area where complaints can be found.. phone keeps on asking to cover the full sensor which some times gets annoying.. face unlock is slow.. and useless.. disappointed there..6) Audio quality is good.Overall an average phone for less than 15k budget

  Good phone (4star) but pathetic delivery service from Amaz0n. It took nearly a month for delivery and that too - after 4 follow ups with customer care. None of the delivery dates promised by customer care was fulfilled by Amaz0n. I am currently facing similar issue with few other orders as well. Makes me loose confidence in placing orders with Amaz0n , especially if its something we need before an occasion ( say a birthday gift).

  Product looks good but mobile works wierd some times.... Looks like bugs are there. Look, can, touch, battery....awesome. OS or SW proble. Is there. Screen auto blinks till we restart, wifi disables for every two minutes. Restart fixes temporarily n not permanent fix. Whatsapp messages goes as just message n not voice... Tried every thing as Google Play expert but not fix. Better, you could have fixed these bugs before M31ot M31S, A21S others... I'm a big fan of Samsung since Grand 2 release. I lost my trust after this purchase... Sorry!!!! My grade is absolutely based on device performance, bugs n issues facing...

  Within 10 days there is a dot on the screen it slowly spread across all the phone screen with dark blue color, I took to the service centre he says you have kept your phone in the pocket so it happened l, he says you have to pay 6000 for screen replacement it's hardly 20 days of purchase of phone, I don't understand one thing if I don't put my phone in the pocket where should I keep it, on my head?????? Most worst phone this is not as strong as samsung used to be go for a good one...not this one

"
"

  I used this phone for two months and all of a sudden it started developing a pink screen. I didn't drop the phone, didn't damage it, didn't poke the screen with any object. The screen just developed a pink screen and it started spreading across the entire screen from one point. The glass was in pristine condition and there was absolutely no damage to the phone but it had developed this issue on its own. I took it to Samsung's official service center and they denied warranty over a manufacturing defect. I had to pay 5 and a half grand out of my own pocket for the repair.Would definitely **not** recommended anyone to buy this.

"
"

  Good performance. Some r saying bad processor but its a cheapest 9611 chip. Previously I was using Galaxy on5 pro so for me its a perfect smartphone. Planned to buy realme 6 pro but they increased price by 1000 rupees whereas M21 decreased price by 300 rupees. So for me its a value for money coz i saved 5000 rupees by avoiding chinese phone

  This is Genuine review after 14 days of usage...""ONE OF THE EASIEST PHONE TO RECOMMEND,PERIOD"""".........Firstly this is an excellent phone which packs up all the features of a mid range phone ..I choos this phone because I prefer samoled and big battery.perphaps they are the key highlights of this phone. Many reviewers praised this phone For it's excellence in this price segment.1 thing that I would like u to note is that the cam quality is not that great to look at because this is a kind of entry level phone.And processor is ok and graphic games like PUBG runs well with that Exynos 9611.but not that great like other midrange phones.But the RAM is not that great because it's management is poor as it can hold the data only for couple of minutes........Overall this is the best smartphone phone present in the market offering such good features in that low price!!IN MY OPINION THEY MADE THE BEST PHONE!

  The front Camera are not that good in low light but the back Cameras are awesomeüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª. The battery life  Is amazing it can last for a day in normal use but I don‚Äôt recommend it for gaming because Ark mobile doesn‚Äôt run that smooth ya it has 6gm ram and 128gm storage but if it had a snapdragon chip instead of their chip set it could be the best phone üëçüèªüëçüèª Under ‚Çπ20,000.The fingerprint scanner works fine as every phone.i am using it for about one week i think. If you need a budget phone I will recommend. if my review helped you then click the helpful button üëçüèª I will write a update after one month Bye the way PUBG runs smooth tho it can run even in HD Graphics and Ultra But not in HDR

  The phone has a good camera and great display as you'd expect from a Samsung phone. The battery will last a over a day even with heavy use. The processor may not be the fastest but it can handle most of the tasks pretty easily though intensive gaming may suffer a bit. The speaker is loud and yes, speaker as there's only one, it doesnot come with stereo speakers.The phone's screen is pretty tough and has survived a few drops easily without a scratch.Coming back to the camera, this has triple camera on the back and the main and wide angle cameras are decent and give flexibility while taking photos. The front camera may at times produce a bit softer images but at the price point it doesn't get much better.The phone also has android 10, the latest one and system updates are quite regular.Overall if you're looking for phone with great battery life, amazing display and good camera you cannot go wrong with this phone

  My review after 1 month of use.Things I like:1.awesome super amoled display2.slim and weightless3. No camera bump.4. Audio via headphone is awesome.5. User friendly one UI.Thing I ok with:1.good camera, both front and rear. I'm ok with camera performance2.finger print sensor little bit slow but ok.3.decent performance and gaming. For gaming is your priority you can buy 730g or 720g powered mobile.4. Good battery backup. M21 comes with 6000mah battery but battery backup feels like 5000mah.Thing I don't like:1.battery takes almost 3 hours to complete fullcharge even with inbox 15w charge.2.plastic build, backside easily get scratched. Big bottom bezels.3. Missing some oneUI features like Knox security,edge lighting,goodluck app for UI customization. No inbuilt applock, photo video lock,You have to use third party apps.

  Pros :- Display is amazing 10/10- UI is great and not much bloatware unlike other brands- The processing power of camera is really goodCons:- The back is a fingerprint magnet and prone to scratches- Haven't noticed any heating issues yet or anything else. Will update when I find any other issues.

  I had bought more than 10 mobiles in my career but not totally satisfied with any one of those.I decided to go with samsung and I bought Samsung galaxy m21.When I used this mobile I firstly liked very much it's Amoled display which is ultimate.The mobile is beast in its performance.No heating,no lagging just like a smooth baby.When it comes to camera it is not lesser than any professional cameras.Night shoot is something which is very very cool.Fingerprint is faster when compared to other mobiles I used before.It comes with 6000mAh battery which is more than enough.It also get charged very quickly.This mobile get updated in time with new unique features.All over this is a mobile which gives you a luxury feeling.Sound quality is very clear no disturbances.It runs heavy games like a flowing water. I have played pubg and free fire and I have found no negatives.Till now I have not found any drawbacks in this mobile.These are true words of mine.No one of these is fake.Hope this review is helpful to you.I prefer to buy this mobile without any confusion.

  Utterly disappointment from seller's sideüò§I wanted a phone immediately so I bought this product 4 days back. I have never seen this kind of worst packing ever for a phone. The package was damaged. There was some minor scratches on the body and camera frame. I didn't mind it bcz if I return this product it might take two or three weeks to get a new one because of this lockdown.Okay whatever it is, lets forget itüòîIn my 4 days experience,I feel this is the best value for money phone in this price segment.Battery is amazing it will last for 1.5 days after full charged. We get about 9.5 hrs aprox for normal usage.Display quality is mind blowingCamera is okay (its excellent when comparing with the other phones in this segment )Fingerprint reader is faster enough.Only i found a small problem with the display screen refresh rate. It could be improved, because the display might feel little laggy sometimes after changing it to dark mode.Although it's an amazing affordable gadget.üòâ

  Value for money. I am not a gamer So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great.Brilliant camera, huge battery life and excellent amoled display in addition with the premium feeling of samsung.

  I can say that in the 14000 range samsung m21 is the beastI loved samsung os üòçüòçüòçüòçü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©everything has good optimisationCamera optimisation is very very goodSamsung is the top brand where we can find good camera and good os I never founded any lags in the normal usageOne thing I say that in the 14000 range samsung m21 is the only one brand which is providing perfect and good os and super amoled display and 6000 mah battery good camera so I can say it is the toppest phoneSamsung is improvingIf we come to the gaming there is no lags in normal gaming but don't do hard gamingSome people say that this phone becoming hot and there is a battery drain issueBut I didn't find any issueSo I surely recommend this phone please don't buy mi,oppo phones Samsung is non Chinese phone and Samsung has no adds and security is very good with powerful optimisationIf you are a normal user then the phone will run smoothly like a butter so you can go for Samsung m21

  I got fantasised by seeing the reviews, response for M21 model and ordered on for my mother.My only reason to order it is the battery life.. but my expectations fails miserably.Pros:DisplayCons:Battery drains so fast with usage of 7 to 8 hours which includes video play for approx 3 hours and rest is normal screen. and does not involve any gaming or high performance apps.. Hardly last for over a day.Phone got hanged while receiving call had to restart the phoneWhatsApp video kept playing had to restart the phone.Camera is average.

"
"

  Well if you're scared of buying Chinese products and also you have budget constraints. Then this is the best deal ‚ò∫Ô∏èIt's been a month now and it surpassed my expectations.1- long-lasting Battery Life2- Display is awesome3- Speaker/Mic is quite good4 - PUBG gameplay is smooth5- Camera could have been better6- No heating issues

"
"

  In 2020, a brand like Samsung is making worst than Mi or Realme. In the same price You can get much better smart phone than this one or A SERIES or M SERIES.Good-  Screen- super amoled display is really good. Battery- really performs great. 50% charge took for 8 hours of gaming. Oprimiser work really well to perform lagless use.Processor- works fine.Bad- (IMPORTANT) NERWORK RECEPTION- this phone is only made for indian sim card. Here except metro cities the mobile network mostly has issues. Internet peception is bad than MI and realme. Whatsapp videocall are slower than other phones in the same network, same location. Download speed is slower even.CAMERA- REALLY WORST EXPERIENCE WITH CAMERA. Closer image doesnt take focus. 48 megapixcel is just fake.Just do not waste your valuable money.

  I bought Samsung M21 on 10 July, After 20 days use I write it's performance1.Camera is very good,it takes clear hd pics with both front and rear cameras ,In 48 mp it's makes pics of 8000√ó6000 big best quality pic and in 20 mp it's 5148√ó3888 best quality selfie.  In this cost camera is value for money.2. Battery performance is also very good ,15 watt fast charger full the battery very fastly ,i watched 2 hours movie(using headphones) ,battery  down 100% to only 98%  so battery is awesome3. Screen and sound quality is also very good.4.It's android functions is very good like pop up window,always on display,dark mode,widgets etc.5. Most important it's network adapting feature is also very good,it's catches signal more than other phones in my home.6.Net speed also provide very fast but it also depend on network provider also.7.Wifi catches in office is also provide very fast speed and best signal quality

"
"

  The 15watt charging is very bad it's like charging a phone has 5 watt charger very slow charging.. samsung is a non Chinese product that's why I bought this product but it is not upto the expectations and price is also high as compared to other phones, if it is a redmi, oppo vivo phone that is good in everything. And unnecessary app installed in this phone why I have to disable them if I dont want that in my phone the uninstall function has to be there but not given, If I want I'll download it from play store. display and mobile is good. But has some disappointed why the do all those things which we don't want in our mobile of we need that app we can also download then why they installed already and the uninstall function is not given for that app but we can disable only..

"

  The build of the device feels premium both in hand and from looks, the performance is upto the expectations with performance on demand when needed the most. The camera quality is vivid and colour immersion is brilliant, the wide range of lenses allows it to be a all rounder in any condition whether in low light condition or wide angle shots the quality and colour contrast is just amazing. Coming to screen and the battery the Amoled display with FHD support brings out each details to the maximum, the colour contrast and depth is just amazing and the battery and the processor of the device makes sure that the the device gives out its maximum each time the user demands.In a short the devices is just brilliant, each aspect from its processor, battery to screen display quality and ratio is of premium benchmark quality and yet in the normal budget, the device surely provides a feel of its successor in the flagship range from Samsung.

  So far nice mobile at this price a good combination of RAM and ROM the camera quality is unbelievable the pic quality is extraordinary and taking vids in this m21 is an awesome experience for even those who were not aware about professional photography  like me and when coming to battery the 6000mah does its work perfectly for more than 30 hrs even in continuous use of the internet overall performances of the phone is outstanding and the fingerprint reader is way good and it stays in the back of the phone no zigzags of the thumb in the screen overall a thumbs up for made in India phone

  I've been using this phone since 26 June 2020 and I've found it good enough. It's fast, has a vibrant screen and awesome battery life. The camera is fine by me because I'm not interested in its camera. The sound quality too is great and the vibrant colours give me a nice movie experience. Overall, happy with the specs at this price range.Only one hiccup: once in a blue moon, the phone restarts!!!! This has happened to me about four times. I'm in the middle of something and it just goes off. üôÑ This is the only issue I'm facing. Hope a software update will help.

  Likes:Call clarityUI (one UI is great)Camera quality is awesome even in artificial lightingScreen color is vibrant and excellentEasy to grip in handDislikesUI (Really don't like having 2 galleries, 2 calendars, 2 clocks etc. One from Samsung and one from Google.Lacks a protective cover out of the boxThe screen has some color shift that's visible on white background when tilting, but that's not much of an issueFinally the biggest dislike is the sudden price increase by 1-1.5k after I purchased it and recommended to others. Taking advantage of preference to non-chinese phones instead of making more they increased the price and lost a lot of potential customers.

  Top notch phone in mid range.Likes: UI, Camera (Rear and Front). There are certain bery good features for selfie.. just show yoir oalm for taking selfie.. loved it Samsing..There are numerous small small features which make u feel amazed daily..Things which could have been better: Charger could have been 18 or 30 watt. However, currently rpovided 15w type C charger also does the job completely.Best of Best phone in this range. THANK YOU SAMSUNG.

"
"

  I have to buy a phone for my friend, so bought this , 1n half to two days battery life with normal usages, no gaming,  super almond screen better then those Chinese ips panels, also i don't like mi realme etc as they show many ads,  i am personally using a70s, and  suggesting my all relative / friends to avoid PURE Chinese products

"
"

  It is really a nice product. I have used many phones before, but this is a total package which has given features for every thing you think. Truly, a nice product under a relevant price.  The only thing I found after using it(although using it since 4 days only) is that it takes too much time to charge, battery support is 6000maH, which gives good backup, but it would be better with a 18watt charger.Overall, the best product I have used so far.

  My review for Samsung Galaxy M21 after using it for a month . Lets see the pros and cons of the device...Pros:1. sAMOLED 6.4 inch Display2. 6000 mah battery which can give an easy 1.5 day standby for light usage3. Fingerprint and Face recognition work good.4. AR Zone, where we can create AR emoji and AR stickers.5. Dolby atmos6. Triple camera with 48MP+8MP+5MP the 48 MP works decent and 20MP selfie camera does it's part.7. RAM Management is nice.Cons :1. Plastic body2. No notification light, even no carrier speed indication.3. Screenguard is not pre applied and no backcase is provided in the box.4. Full charge takes 2 to 2.5 hrs from 0-100%, as in the box we will be provided a 15W charger.If gaming is not your highest priority, I would highly recommend this mobile phone. As it works very decent for daily activities.

  Had Redmi note 4 for almost 3 and a half years.. Wanted an upgrade.. Samsung m21 does most of the tasks right.. Epic battery lasting over 2.5 days of usage.Camera is good.. Much better than Redmi in this price range.Display is on another level as it  is really beautiful Amoled.Clean UI.. haven't tested on gaming yet...Samsung is back on track....Cons: Fingerprint magnetNo plastic case in box

"
"

  the phone is overall a good buy, the only con which i faced is regarding internet based calling app's full screen call notification.The phone‚Äôs battery performance, charging time, camera n all r pretty good. Its the best choice in all aspects.

"
"

  Value For Money !! Battery performance was very good.We can use it for Two days  standby for normal use.And the Display is all large with full hd.It has a6000Mah battery, still looking not bulky easy to carry it. Noglass body, but who cares after you put a back cover.. In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers.Back camera pretty good with 48 mp but front camera's low light output is very low..it is of 20 mp many features available such as slow and super slow motion can be rcorded.This Android 10 with One UIFinger print reader Face lock and finger print reader are fast. Processor and performance is good my phone didn't hang till now it has been 2 months exactly...Provided with type c cable for fast charging.No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic...

"
"

  Pros:1. I love Samsung UI though it is very clean.2. Screen Quality is awesone because samsung always provide super amoled display.3. Camera Quality is also good and the night mode is quite stable incomparison to other mid range phones.4. Battery Life is awesome offcourse there is 6000 mah battery.5. Call Quality is also nice and speakers have perfect sound.6. Face Recognization is quite fast incomparison to previous versions of M series.7.Fingerprint reader is also fast.8. The one new thing samsung provides Bibxy Vision in M21.Cons:1. Samsung Should provide 18W or 22W charger.

"

  Samsung M21 comes with good specs and offer decent performance. I opted 4GB 64 GB version, and I'm using it for the past two and half months. I'm very happy with my purchase.The 6.4inch HD display is really amazing and the exinos processor provide ample power for multitasking. The set is made-up of plastic and comes with a glossy finish. The rear mounted fingerprint reader is pretty fast and easy to access.We cannot say that the camera quality is superb, but in this price range it offers more  than what we expect.The battery life is outstanding and 6000 MAh li-poly provide enough juice for a day and half with moderate usage.The Samsung UI on android 10 is simple nd easy to use. I am happy to recommend this smartphone to my friends who have a tight budget..

  I didn't want to review this phone beacuse i the thought why should i write something about the product which i am using. But i got a msg the review your phone on Amazon and get a change to win (****) .then i thought to write this review about Samsung galaxy M21 .this phone is amazing ,battery runs more than 2 days and display is like i am watching something live infront of my eyes .And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic very smooth, slim , curved and colour is so beautiful.. just after unboxing of this phone i used camera ...OMG i was like WOW is it a phone or a DSLR camera .superb pictures i clicked and shoot video also .and slomo in this phone's camera is like you can read everything on a moving object. ....Love from a small village for Samsung

  samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimmic to claim it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge etc but reality is far far away from claims.very disappointed in terms of charging it's taking too much of time...earlier I was used realme 3pro,time battery life is good and it it's a 4050mah.but here Samsung India has mentioned 6000mah,too much of time for 100%charging..Don't cheat the people with this type of wrong features mentioned in the site.i was very disappointed....I thought that I am going to return it.  This is cheating.i have received this phone on 15th july..from that day onwards u have to count for return or replacement. Already u had shown me the date 25th july for return/replacement.but now you have mentioned return policy is closed on 22nd july..

  Reviewing Samsung M21 after 2 months of usage..I'll divide this review between pros and cons..Pros1. Battery life : battery life in this phone is just phenomenal.. It'll easily last for 1.5 days with a heavy usage..2. Display : Super amoled display is just awesome and if you were using ips display you'll definitely feel the difference when it comes to super amoled..3. Weight: despite having a 6000 mah battery, the phone doesn't weigh much..4. Camera: The triple cam rear shooter works fine and it's good enough considering the price and the 20 mp front cam also does a decent job..5. User Interface: The one ui of this phone is lag free,feels better and has no ads6.Dolby atmos: This phone supports dolby atmos when earphones are plugged in and it's good..Cons1.Looks of the phone : This phone has a polycarbonate body and it has a glossy finish which is prone to scratches2. Gaming Performance: I did noticed some frame drops while playing Call of Duty and the processor could have been better..3.No 18W charger: An 18 W charger could have been included so that the 6000mah battery could be charged in less thaan 2 hrs4. Lacks macro lens in rear cam setup5.Should have included gorilla glass 5 instead of gorilla glass 3Final verdict..If you are not a heavy gamer and you prefer to watch more movies and stuff in netflix or amazon prime you can go for this phone..The 6000 mah battery is a big plus and for normal use this phone will be the best choice and the brand value of samsung is always a plus..

  Highly disappointed with the camera quality of this phone. Video focusing is very slow and can't capture a clear video. Front camera is just disgusting. I have asus max pro m2 of price 10,000 which has 13 mp camera and it has a much better quality than this phone's camera. And ausus's front camera is also very good compared to this. All other things are good. Battery life is just incredible. UI is attractive.  Heats up quickly on game playing

"
"

  Things I like :*superAmoled Display*powerful Battery*No network issues like in previous M series.*Awesome camera :- couldn't ask for better in this range.*features like Samsung note ,long screenshot , Always on Display are awesome.*Regular updates.Etc.Things I dislike:-*Even it has 6 gb ram still sometime keyboard stuck , so I am using Google indic keyboard.*Battery drain is more than it was when new.*Little heavy ( due to 6000mAH battery but it's not that much , my previous phone was only 133g this is around 188g )* Besides above three there is nothing for to to be concerning.If it is okay for you then you can go with it. It is just awesome according to it's price.

"
"

  Can someone help out in the time taken to charge the battery and as well the how many hours will it last on 1 charge ? As my phone has took around 4hr to get charged for 55% on the first charge.

  I bought this device for me a few days ago ..When i was reading the reviews I got disappointed reading the negative reviews .. But I am using Galaxy M21 (4GB/64GB) from 5-6 days .. and i have just only one thing to say ..it's the best u can get from a non-chinese company in such a price point .. Seriously I am in love with the device .. It's Triple Camera .. It's Amoled display .. It's 6000mAH battery .. All are superb ! .. The One UI is amazing and totally ad-free .. there are 2-3 bloatware apps but they can be uninstalled .. I have shifted from Redmi 7 (which is a crap) to this device and I must say this that the money spent is absolutely worth it !! .. If ur budget is low than must go for Samsung M21 and u will not regret .. I also forgot to mention that i was a Samsung hater but now things have changed .. A lot,I must say !!*Cons* -1) The Battery takes around 2.5 hrs for refill but I think it's ok because the battery is massive ! However, The battery lasts around 2 days if u have minimal usage .. but if u have heavy usage than it will last around a day which is superb i guess !2) There a few framedrops in pubg after continously for 2hrs but that's OK for me (but there is no heat issue)3) No More : ) .. Will update if i Found later

  I ordered the phone for my grandfather who hasn't used a smartphone prior to this one.UI: Samsung is doing a good job keeping their phones very user friendly and easy to adapt.Battery: The battery will last forever as it is equipped with a 5,000 mAh battery.Screen: The screen has pleasing colours (super-Amoled).Finger print scanner: Physical fingerprint scanner (fast and accurate).Storage: 64GB more than sufficient for my grandfatherCameras: A department that blew me out and got me addicted to the phone. 48MP camera was simply beautiful, the colours, the dynamic range, the clarity/details are on par with much expensive phones from other brands.Easily recommend this one for any one in and around this budget ditch the M11 for this.

"

  The Exynos 9 series soc works smooth for Samsung galaxy M21 considering standard usage as this is not a gaming phone. The camera quality is good. 6000 mAh battery gives you a back up of at least 24 hrs  once under full charge. Samsung offers the new One UI 2.0 interface  with M21 which is not found in other samsung phones in this range.User must not always go by lucrative features like  camera and memory only. The hardware is  the life line of any electronic device. M21 offers  good quality mid range hardware  suitable for standard usage.Fast charging claimed by samsung is not as fast given that it provides 15 Watt charger with box  contrasting to the 18 watt and 22 watt chargers of other phones in this range.Fingerprint sensor works fast and is good but malfunctions when there is smudge on sensor or your fingers are sweating.Overall feature is good and it is the best buying option under 15K given the recent  Go Swadesi trend in India.

  An advice , please buy yourself a back case/cover before you get the phone. I am working from home, i kept the phone in my wooden desk and bed only, and in 3 days the phone has multiple scratches in back. Possibly from just dust or tiny sand like particle. So I highly advice you to get the case before the phone reach you. Also dont buy any black sided tempered glass. I have bought 3 and all of them cover 2-3 mm of screen in all 4 sides, and it feels like phone of 2014 thick bazel. So better buy a full transparent tempered glass and use your phone from edge to edge like it was  intended to be used. But emphasize on the back case. The phone performs great. Hope this help you.

"
"

  Awesome display quality, an option to filter blue light. No bloatware and it allows u to disable or uninstall unwanted applications. Way too fast 4GB/64GB. Sturdy built. Touch experience is like a breeze. Speaker sound is 3.5 out of 5, not too loud like the Chinese phones. Feels very comfortable while holding it and using it with just one hand.Go for it guys!!!

"

  I have been using this phone for the past two days. Actually the phone is really good and worth for the price. One thing is that I am facing an issue is, It gets heated (not too much) while charging and also taking too long to charge. But the battery life is equally good, It did not drop for me less than 40 even though I am using whole day and playing PUBG( not for long, only little bit about 2-3 hrs a day). Also, No heating issues while using and also playing. How much heat generated for normal mobile, just a kind of heating only. Apart from that performance is really good with Exynos 9611, Also Samsung UI 2.0 gives a lot of customization options for everything.Overall phone is really good and buys it for a Samsung brand.If they could have given 5000MAh battery with 15+W charger, then It would have been best.Rating: 4.5/5Hope this will helps you.

"
"

  Phone is good for its price range.It feels a little fragile so a good case is recommended. One ui is ‚ù§‚ù§,great customizations and all the features you need.Screen is the best in price range. Camera quality is above par. Although it does not have all the bells and whistles like the A series like good lock and knox security but for its price i am okay with it. Fingerprint reader and Face unlock work seamlessly. I am not much of a gamer but processor seems to be good for day to day usage. There is no annoying ads and stuff though some bloatware is preloaded.Battery life is good but not as expexted frrom a 6000 mah phone maybe because of the processor and charging takes a little more time.Overall an allround phone for its price ( also its non chinese).

  Hi there, if you are on a budget of 13-14k, do not waste your time thinking of any other phone. Just purchase Samsung Galaxy M21.‚ñ™Ô∏èSoftware - Good Job Samsung üëç clean UI, thankfully the pre-installed unwanted app are removable.‚ñ™Ô∏èFingerprint reader is excellent and very fast. Face unlocking is also available.‚ñ™Ô∏èBattery life is humongous.‚ñ™Ô∏èSamsung's displays are always fluid and produce good quality images.

  I bought it for Rs. 13,499 about a month back.It is not so heavy in weight.It has the best display that you can get for the money spent.I only play light games like Candy Crush, 8 Ball Pool and it works flawlessly.Processor is fine and there are are no major lags or stutters in normal usage.Battery works for an odd 11 + hours with net browsing, youtube, facebook, whatsapp etc.Camera is good in daylight both front and back. But a lot of noise comes in pics captured in darkness.Fingerprint is ok and face unlock is a hit or a miss.Audio output via Headphone jack is awesome.Earpiece Call quality is loud, crisp and clear.I hope that I have covered all the points.

  Battery is 6000 mah. But works like 5000mah. Charging is also slow. Quality of battery is good in Samsung m20. Comparison this phone. Camera is 48 mp but work like 20 mp. Average mobile. Samsung should be include 25 w charger with this. Quality of sound in speaker is loud .But it is not melody. its irritating the nose

"

  received the product today only. loved the phone. a bit heavy and not slim but worth the price. if you're tight on budget and still wish to own a phone with good camera and sound... you should definitely go for it without a doubt. camera is superb. sound quality is good. display is amazing. ovetall a good phone. finger print sensor and face recognition also works fine.

  Best in class phone in its price range...the Samsung galaxy M21 is comparably the best to its competitors like the redmi note 9 series, Moto g8, Huawei, and even it's tough competitor...Realme. Nothing beats it in its 6000 Mah mega üîã battery and even having a 15 w fast charger that is the perfect power for a long term use. The cameraüì∏ is awesome and the best thing is it's super steady video. I'm a rigorous Mobile phone gamer and the Exynos 9611 processer makes its damn smooth which is backed up by a speed of 2.3GHz Octa Core. I must say I'm a graphic fan and my Samsung galaxy M21's 6.4"" sAMOLED display makes my eyes sparkle every time I put my finger in its damn fast finger print sensor. And last but not the least, I'm a very loose handed person and the Corning gorilla glass 3 protection is doing a great job. Thank you SAMSUNG for making this pocket friendly dream phone possible.

  Samsung M21- overall experience ,till now is very good and best part is it is made in india mobile :-).With 6 GB Ram and 128 GB ROM, this phone is definitely value for money.Comes with android 10 and one UI2.0 which is far better then other mobile phones in same range for example Xiaomi.Performance is very good , you can open multiple apps without any issue.Dolby sound option is fairly good and screen is best in class for those who like to watch movies on mobile.No heating issues, durable body and good design.Camera quality and options are very good.Negative points,1.which I feel while playing games, this phone may not be very useful for those who like to play online games for long durations, it is still good if you play for short duration like 30-40 min.2. Charging time - it takes more than 3 hours for full charge.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is fast.üëçüèΩCamera quality is ok.6000mAh Battery runs for a longer time on a single charge.üëçüèΩCompany should supply a pre applied screen guard and a tpu case in the box.üëéüèΩYou have to buy screen guard & a protective case separately.But Samsung Galaxy M31 is a better deal than M21.

  It almost looks like Samsung a70 or a50 but the quality is a little bit low considering build. The phone looks good. The camera is not performing up to the mark. The front camera is not good, Back camera also 48mp but not up to the mark. The camera department needs improvement.If you are looking for the camera don't go for this phone.The rest all are like Samsung, Durable, Reliable, and Steady.

  Writing this review after one month of usage.1.The phone is brilliant.2. Battery life great. For medium users it will easily last for 2 days in single charge. And for heavy users too the phone will easily last for one and half days.3. Great display. Super Amoled display doesnt have any competitor.4. Smooth performance.5. Few junk apps preinstalled. But they can be uninstalles.6. Sound quality good. Which was a complaint in earlier samsung devices.7. Fast charging supported. And the charger supplied is a fast charger.8. Camera quality great. Auto mode detection is accurate. There is a feature of best shot guide. So everytime you click a photo it comes out to be great.9. As of now software upates are available.10. Overall this is a samsung mid range killer. You get a great brand. And great performance.

  Good product for this price range,But manufacturing defects may be an area which may disappoint you and change your buying decision because the unit which I got was defected around the finger print area,While pressing on the fingerprint it is getting inside of the body which is not a good sign for future as this is happening at just the 20 days of brand new phone buying,Also found some scratch on the top of the body which is not much noticeable but also not much negligible so going to complaint against the seller also as this may be used product and already seal opened product,Noticed the same after 20 days till that my return window was closed,Now looking for online complaint registration against Samsung for such a cheap manufacturing quality and charging like a other manufacturer those are offering really a quality product.

  Both front and back camera are very poor and the mobile hangs sometimes.The fb app is preinstalled and you cannot uninstall it, this app steals all your personal data from mobile and this is disgusting, feels like every time these big tech companies are watching me.Big Privacy and security gap. Totally hate it.

  After one day usage I'm writing  this review. I can say that mobile is stylish, S AMOLED Display looks very good, camera is also good, finger print sensor  is fast, but face recognition  is slow. Some features not available  like, clock of 12 hours, with weather.  We have to use 2 different  widgets for that. Works good for now. Not the best of battery  backup.

"
"

  I am very much disappointed with this phone..The is very delicate phone. my mobile screen got damaged within 1 month  with simple fall from hand. i used others phones but i never experienced this delicacy....i felt like very cheap quality screen they have used. it is not able to withstand simple fall......please don't buy it if you have habit of dropping  the phone.. even the warranty won't cover this when we buy phone....think twice before buying it.I don want give credit for any other features.....worst experience with Samsung mobile phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  I received this phone on 12th July 2020. It was supposed to be a birthday gift for my mom. After a week of usage, she noticed that there is a certain lag, and sim cards are not detected frequently. The touchscreen malfunctions and multiple apps start to open up automatically without actually touching the screen. The phone is not able to detect sim cards in the slot majority of the time and hangs frequently. The phone hangs in such a way that I'm not even able to unlock the phone because the fingerprint scanner stops working and the screen does not record the unlock pattern drawn. I have to reboot each time. This happens every time, after just 10-15 mins of usage, leaving the phone completely useless. It seems to be a defected piece and I did not expect such service from this platform after having paid such amount of money online. I need a replacement.

"
"

  I  bought it with exchange offer. Amazon exchange offer is better than Flipkart. I exchanged my Redmi Note 7 & got ‚Çπ6500 discount. Earlier I tried to exchange with Flipkart, they are offering same amount but during delivery, delivery boy said your phone is slightly bent and offered only ‚Çπ3800 discount. So, I cancelled the deal with Flipkart.Review after using 2 days..... Amoled screen is awesome. Camera quality is much  better than I expected. Fingerprint reader is working fast.  Battery life is good.

"

  Camera is very low as compare to other product offering 48mp camera,,its pic ratio is 3:4 and cannot use any other pic enhancement on the same,,even flash is automatic,u ca√±ot use it mannialy.camera hangs n crashes several time while using 48mp feature.pic take too much time to save on gallery and may get blurry if i dnt keep ur camera still for 4 sec or lesss.its too unfare on basis of camera..48 mp is just n i.age size but in real its just 12mp camera.....so dnt buy it if u r seeking for good camera phone

"
"

  This is the best phone I have used so far. Makkhan se bhi zyada smooth.. I'm loving it. The kind of pictures and video this phone takes is simply mindblowing. All HD quality.It matches the quality of one plus, which I used long back. Samsung has definitely upgraded its mobile phone and also kept the price competitive.Happy with this purchase.

"
"

  Better to go with other brands. Mobile quality not much as expected and hearing volume too low. I never expected such a bad product from Samsung. When I return without any questions Amazon get back this product. Seems they already know these problems in the device.

  Have been using the M21 4GB RAM version for a month now and I am totally satisfied with the phone.Points:1. I particularly liked the screen quality and the battery life of the phone very much.2. I did not do any gaming but I guess it should be fine handling normal gaming.3. The camera quality is quite good.4. UI interface is also very fine and smooth.5. Most importantly, MADE IN INDIA.6. Did not find any cons till now, had a great experience using this phone.All in all, worth my money.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is one of those rare phone which fulfill all the needs of a user. This device gets all things correct at its price.It has got the best sAmoled display, best 1.5 day lasting battery of 6,000 mAh with 15 W fast fast charging. It also has one of the best OneUI 2.0 which provides best user experience. The camera quality is also very good considering it has got 48 MP main camera. The processor manages to perform day to day task at ease.I recommend this phone to anyone who has this budget and can blindly go for it. It's simply best.

  I am writing this review after using it for about a month. I've noticed certain pros and cons in this phone. I've 4gb/64gb variant.Pros1. Amoled display is just awesome(good viewing angles).2. Good Battery life(in heavy use too it takes about a day to completely drain your battery).3. Processor is above average. In normal use it works good no lag.4. Good fingerprint scanner.5. Speakers are good.6. Day time camera quality is good.Cons1. Network reception is not good.2. Photos get a bit soft when clicked through front facing camera.3. Processor is not for hardcore gaming.4. There is a little bit of heating issue while charging.5. 15W charger is not up to the mark.

  Bought this phone on 3rd september 2020 and was delivered on 4th september 2020Touch screen stopped working on 17th September. So disappointedReached out to Amazon, they said their policy covers only 7 days.Reached out to samsung. They said replacement is only 14 days and since its 17 days it will go for repairs.For repairs , first they were not sure how much time will it take. Then after pushing they gave me 15 days time.Spoke  to what's app chat support for Samsung they said they are marking it urgent and will be done in 7 days.After they are still saying it's not done yet and contact after 1-2 daysSuch a pathetic experience after spending 15000 rs

  I am giving this review after 70 days of use.If you are not very much passionate about gaming and photography I think this is the best option.Longer Battery LifeI have played Call of Duty Mobile which runs fine on it. and 1 hr of playing consumes only 10% of the charge on Wifi.Good Camera Quality: Meets my requirement for casual photography.The device body is made up of plastic, which gets scratches on the backside, better to use good quality back cover.Performance is not bad.Android 10 and OneUI impressed me.AMOLED Screen and Dolby Atmos makes it fit for entertainment use.

  I bought 6GB - M21 Variant and reviewing after 1 month of use.PROSCamera =4.5/5 - very good features.Display =4.5/5Battery = 4/5 time to reacharge 0 to 100% is slightly higher = 2 hours 15 minutesProcessor = works smooth & fast for short time - but if your gamer and working more than hours on phone - it starts woking slowly.Features = 4.5/5 its cool - u can increase or decrease touch sensitivity, Smart share, call recording,  Dual messenger, etc.Sound quality = 5/5 impressiveWeight = 4.5/5 nicely managed - even after putting backCONScharging cable length is short =500mmNot responding keypad after longer use of phone.Battery doesn't feel like 6000 mhSmart calling feature is not there- e.g if im using sim1 for X person always-it should not ask to choose sim everytime i called.

  Purchased this on 06th August and received the product with a microphone issue. Requested for replacement and not happened even after 2 months. Amazon updated the wrong IMEI number in their system and replacement is not happening. Contacted customer care team multiple times and every time the answer was issue resolved and IMEI updated in their system and each time the delivery executive has the same answer, ""IMEI no not matching, Please contact customer care"". Also the quality of the product is not as expected. Full battery charge will not last more than 1.5 days in moderated usages(I am not a gamer and I don't play games on mobile). The camera is ok, not super compare to same price range mobiles. Sound quality is bad in my mobile.

  It was delivered within 2days from date of order.Now let's talk about it.1. Battery is really great2. Camera is too good in budget with super slow motion feature.3. Processor , whoever said it's not for pubg they are wrong. You can play very smoothly without lag on HD.4. No heat up issue at all.5. No worthless ad on home screen like cheap chinese smartphone6. Fingerprint sensor works like butter.7. Screen size and display is crisp and clear due to Amoled screen.8. Compared and trust me Redmi don't stand infront of Samsung.9. SIM slot is too good you and use two sim with sd card at the same time10.Stop buying cheap chinese smartphone, instead buy Samsung with little amount extra and get yourself a better and durable smartphone.That all i need to say to all

"
"

  I purchases the samsung device after 8 years due to bycott Chinese product. But it is my worst decision.1. Battery: it claims 6000mah battery but performing like 4000mah. Its not at all lasting for 2 days. Its hardly lasting for 1day with slightly higher use than normal. Really worst performance. It require to charge every day. Watta worst battery.2. My screen is getting hot after clicking 8-9 pictures.Screen is getting hot after use of 30 min of use. Very bad experience. Its touching 43¬∞c.3. Camera quality is not that great but acceptable in this price range.4. Network reception is really really bad. My redmi note3 is reception of network is much better than samsung m21.Please help me to replace this product amazon. It is really bad.

"
"

  It's  an amazing phone and works really awesome, an amazing camera quality where you can click crystal clear pictures. Talking about the storage data I don't think anyone has to even worry about that. I think this was the best phone under Rs.15,000 and it's  worth the cost too. And the best thing is that you have facial recognition which is just perfectly  fine and secure. Next comes to the battery life so I don't think there's any need to talk about this cause well the users must have very well known this by now and for the current purchasers  let me tell you that you will have long running phone battery so just don't worry and also you have great samsung apps in the phone already which to be honest helped me a lot. You even have very secure finger print reader feature and you will discover a lot more if you purchase this phone cause I feel my words won't be enough to describe this awesomely amazing phone.

"
"

  I have completed a month of using M21. So wanted give a short review.First things first. If you are short on the budget but want to have a really good quality phone with all the features, high resolution and all round abilities this is the one to go for.!  I stopped using Samsung from 2015 onwards as their Galaxy smartphones were really not upto the mark and were not worth spending on. But this one, so far, has exceeded all my expectations! Of course you have the option to go for M31 if you don't mind spending a little more. But for this price M21 is a nothing short of a rockstar. The only thing, I wish the fingerprint reader was a little better, little more efficient. But as of yet that is only a minor issue.

"
"

  First time I have purchased Samsung phone but it disappointed me because it have 6000 MAH battery but battery drain is like 3000 mah I have another phone that have 4300 mah that performance is better than this phone  that phone is used 8 months so why you claim that for 6000 mah and fast charging is only they claim but it's not like that so if any option of return will be available then I do that but I have option to replace then I do this let's see any problems in that will not occur.  I don't recommend anybody to buy this phone because they have not such products..

"
"

  It's a nice one. Good design and others. But doesn't  have strong signal connectivity, seems like it's antina is a bit less strong. Also it says it have 6000mah battery capacity. But for me it seems like 5000mah,because before it I was using a set which have 5000mah capacity and this SAMSUNG set I have also have same battery life time of my older set. 5000mah is not bad. But they saying it has 6000mah and it seems like not.

"
"

  ¬†Pros-1. It is a good budget phone with lots of amazing things.2. Good response of Fingerprint sensor.3. Awesome battery life.4. Amazing camera performance as you can see in photos of different views. Depth sensor works perfectly. Wide angle works awesome. Hyperlapse mode is also working wonderfully. Selfie is also quite good.5. Game booster mode works wonderfully. For Pubg and other games it works perfectly. You can play PUBG for couple of hours without having any heating issue.6. sAMOLED display also very good.7. It has some advance features also which is very goodCons-1. Just disappointed by Pro mode in camera it's not upto the mark but still it works nice for normal photography.2. And second is it has only 4x optical zoom.

"
"

  Good phone for this price but it was 2K cheaper when launched and that's really a bad step from Samsung to increase the price when anti-China movement started. The finishing of body of phone is not that great, attracts scratches quite easily. Gaming performance is low when compared to similarly priced phones in the market. For general use like calls, social networking, photography and media consumption its a good phone.

"
"

  Please don't buy. I bought by seeing the reviews at Amazon and it's features. But in actual the product is really worst.  It heats just after 5minutes of call.  And gets hanged during call.  And blurr while playing videos on YouTube. Sound quality is also not good. Finger sensor doesn't work 3 times out of 5. And also every time different add during screen Lock.Don't buy this phone. There are many other phones in this range.And even after replacing the product I am facing all the above issues. Worst service by Amazon.  Return policy is delayed. Never buy from Amazon.It's better to buy from outside.  There you can check and buy at least.

"
"

  Awesome is the single description for the phone. When it comes to battery life a normal user can easily get 18 hrs backup,Front 20mp camera gives you minute details,The best thing that it felt from my hand 5 times in a month corner gorilla... rear 48+8+5  mp camera gives you the best quality of picture.  In my android purchase i g√≤t the best phone . With outstanding performance,  &if u want to use it for business purpose  just go for 6/128  , be free from all worries. It does all for you.I still dont know its full function.Every day i start using my phone it gives me something new to learn.I literally got a full package  on 11999.00 best version of its segment.

"
"

  Initially I purchased this as a secondary device due to its large battery capacity; but 1 month into usage I realized how simply wonderful & aesthetic this product is and what all do you actually need for day to day usage.~Screen - AMOLED 60hz over LCD 90hz any day; those punchy colors and absolute blacks. Simply Amazing.~Battery- The Advertisements of this product highlight battery capacity, and trust me they are lot lying.~One UI 2.0- Samsung One UI 2.0 is best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone.~Camera- Decent. Would not disappoint or amaze you. Does the job.*Not for gaming.So, if you are not a gamer and looking for a phone under 15k, this would do the job and deliver superbly on all fronts.

  I am writing this review after net 1 month of usage.If You get it in 13000 to 13500 for 4GB 64GB Variant then only buy it..Pros-6000maH massive BatterySuper Amoled PanelRear Camera qualityOne Ui 2.0Non Chinese BrandCons-The Front Camera's Quality is not up to the markCharging Speed Very slow it takes around 3Hrs 40min to complete chargeYou can't do heavy gamingBulky DesignThe Exynos 9611 is a Decent processorIt is not for gaming but smooth in day to day life usage.It Can really be a nice option if you want to do online classes,meetings etc. Because of the 6000mah battery and SUPER Amoled display. It is also an excellent option for daily usage...

  This phone has all the good things....Its 48 mp camera take crystal clear pics..And its super amoles display provides best experience...Though its speaker are not that loud...but provides clear and bassy sound...Its battery is good...Its not very good but its good...Its screen on time is 6hrs approximately...Also it will go for a day if you use it normally..Overall its a good phone in 13999‚Çπ...But Samsung need to upgrade their processors...they should have to provide their best exynos processors otherwise they have yo provide Snapdragon processors...

  I am using this phone almost 2 month I have seen some problem of this phoneProblem no. 1.While I open camera the phone become slow  for a few moment2. While I put the headphone plug into this phone there are no sign of headphone on screen3. Camera is not up to the mark4. Charging time a little bit more than any other device but 6000 Mah battery charging time considerable5. This phone was hanged one time in 2 months6. No notification light is there but there is always on display But the good thing is it's battery life though I have not played any games but I  watch almost 6 hours of videos and others after 10hours of display on there is 25 percent charge remainingRam management is goodOne UI 2.0 is amazing experienceFingerprint sensor is goodsAMOLED screen is amazing

"
"

  A little dissappointed by the front camera .Indoor pictures of the front camera are not up to the mark even its have 20 MP camara at the front it looses it's quality in front of redmi 13MP front cameras.Also the back pannel is made of plastic which attracts scratches very fast.. within 2 days i got some scratches at the back. Qlso samsung should have given corning gorilla glass 5 in place of 3 as others are offering 5 at much lower costs and a back pannel of glass as well..Rest of the things are excellent the performance the battery the UI the Samsung branding.P.S: if you are a true selfie lover then this phone is not for you.

"
"

  ¬†After using over 2 weeks I can suggest that if anyone who is looking around 15k then he/she must go for this mobile the reasons are as:1) long battery backup almost one and half days after using pubg..2)camera is too good u can compare the quality of image with other same price mobiles..3)Face Sensor and biometric is very fast its works quickly since I had one phone so I can compare this one with that..It's a budget Phone but it gives u a feeling of flagship phone.so I u have a budget of around 15k then u can buy this mobile rather than other u won't regret on your decision...

  jst in 20 days phone stopped charging ...its a very fragile pc....service centre has got same compliants out 100 apppr 40 for same issue .....so its ear 40% avg  ratio of charging compliants . .horrifying quality of phone not a worth for 6k phone ....amazon sld rethink before advertising it on mass level without quality check n brains.....

"
"

  1. Battery - I can give it 6 stars , battery is the best under 15k.2. Display - The best display ( AMOLED is AMOLED , which is thousand time better than ips lcd) under 15k3. Processor - Its good processor exynos 9611 (better than snapdragon 712) not as good as g90t or snapdragon 720 but above average for daily use (exynos is more power efficient than snapdragon and mediatek)You can play pubg easily.4. UI - One UI 2.0 is very very good, power efficient.5. Camera - Its outstanding,  bettery than any phone under 15k.Back pannel is of somewhat low quality.Charging time is also more (90% in 2hrs, 100% in 2.5 hours).Phone is compact. (Compared to redmi note 9, redmi is very very very large)Go for it if you are confused between redmi note 9, realme 6 , galaxy m21.Its better than galaxy m30s.Best phone under 15k.

"
"

  I have been using the phone for more than a week and here is my experience with it till now :- First of all its a benchmark for premium phones if you are buying smartphone around 10k increase budget little bit and go for it you are not going to regret it-amoled display is a different  kind of experience in itself and really better than LCDAnd it comes with option to change ,if you like natural colors of IPS LCD- both cameras are great-not a heavy gamer  and for day to day life it is best choice in mid range phones-i found it's interface far better than its competitors-fingerprint reader is bit slow

"
"

  To be very honest i am looking for moto one fusion plus, but bad experience with flipkart since past year, flash sale is like a joke, i have been waiting for 1 month for moto, not get it, i bought this phone for my wife she is very happy with Samsung because she already has Samsung on nxt since last 4ys and still working fine, she love to have Samsung, this phones comes with long battery, she has been using it almost a weeks time, and she loves it a lot, i must say this Samsung is the best choice for regular usage you will not feel any problem with device...  thank you amazon on time delivery and exchange program...

"
"

  Very good display and headset use through dolby atom sound. Best to choose wifi calling. Mobile weight is less to compare previous Samsung model(5000mah) like m30,m20 series. Because this is 6000mah. Otherwise waste. Sometimes Stuck and restarted. Not much speed to compare other brand 6GB ram. Also battery life mentioned 6000 mah. But same as to compare 4250 mah battery brand like oppo and vivo. Fast charger provided. But it takes more time (1.45 - 2 hrs), due to big battery.

"
"

  Great mobile  at a affordable price. performance is excellent no lags .battery backup is great. If you are a gamers no recommended. Useful for  normal usage media consumption. Display of the mobile is outstanding. Data cable is short .charging take little time but it's okay in this price segment.

"
"

  I will tell about pro and cons1. I love thsi battery life2. Display its amoled super  Consprocessor waste for gamingNot fast charingCamera quality vvvvvv bad  FinalIf are gamer or photographer don't buy this phoneOr you are a display fan in  budgetIt good

"
"

  I give five stars because of the perfect display. I haven't found any hanging issue while gaming. No heating issue. Camera quality is good in low light and daylight times. I think this phone is not getting the correct rating as it deserves. Overall performance I give 5 stars. I am recommending this phone to my friends.

"
"

  Even 2 mp cameras take better photos than this phone's 20 mp front camera.rear camera takes decent photos but not better than 13mp camera...in normal use also phone gets heated...tried to to connect otg with my adaptor but otg not detecting...only display and battery life is good and nothing else... certainly not 14K value phone....should have been 7k-8k...but 7k phone's selfie is also better than this phone

"
"

  I brought this phone after 15 days frequently disconnecting call. Now sound is not coming on speaker. Camera pics are buried not going to tell anyone to buy this phone. Total wastage of money. Due to covid situation I can't go anywhere I lost my money

"
"

  Touch sensor is one of best thing ever I experience with this smooth piece of cake, battery life is again so so, if using internet for full day then battery drain speedily but  better than other phones, display is one of the best thing one need to experience it, front camera is also great. Picture click from main camera is best you can't separate clicked picture and real thing this is best thing in this mobile

"
"

  It's about more than two weeks that i m using samsung m21 so i would mention following points:Camera: Indoor photos are not that much clear however camera is very good in colour distinctions. Wide angle camera lacks clarity sometimes. Night shots are not that good.Battery: However battery is just amazing and powerful, i use it constantly and it runs for approx 1.5 to 2 days when fully charged.Fingerprint and ace unclock: fingerprint sensor is average but face unlock is quick.UI is also very good and m21 comes with android 10.Sound quality could have been better but for headset mode it comes with dolby atmos that's just wonderful.Good phone under 15000 i would say. One can try for sure.Amazon delivered phone in just two days and shopping experience with amazon is always wonderful

"

  Writing this review after 20 days of usage.Although  Samsung  increased its price from 12499 to 13000.I think it's worth buying.Pros:CameraBatteryDisplayCons:Sound qualityCharger( 15watt fast charger but it takes 2.5 hrs from 10  to 100% charge).No earphone provided although  they increased the price by 1500

  Its a full value for money master piece.All day battery life give by Its 6000mAh battery is just great.The camera quality is also upto the mark.Its screen is just wow. The amoled display gives u full experience and with a good touch sense.I played Pubg on Smoot+extreme combo, yes extreme and that without any lag or frame drop.At HDR+ultra it also gives a very good experience and a i got only 2-3 frame drops in a whole classic match.Its also because mine one is 4+64. U will not get any lag at 6gb ram.And it also have so many interesting features alongside with full proof security.Its just the budget phone u need if u want one with no security issues, wonderful camera quality, mammoth battery life, screen, processor and everthing.Its just the best budget phone.

"
"

  Its a decent phone in the mid range segment. I will describe pointwise.1. Looks of the phone is good. Weight balance is well done. Sometimes phone seems heavy but with such a battery its a better weight management.2. Battery is grear. For 6000mAh, for regular usage it consumes around 50% of my battery. For heavy usuage, then also the battery seems sufficient for a day n half. Charger could have been better though.3. Finger print reader is bit slow. I am hoping it will be fixed via software update.4. Screen resolution is the best feature of this phone at this price range.5.Camera does the justice with no doubt. Night photography hampers a bit.I didn't find any lagging while using the phone.I am using this from 28 days n I find this device to be good in the mid range segment.

  This is really awesome phone with superb features which are actually required in your day to day life.1) Biiiiig battery life-no need to charge frequently, full charge is sufficient for me for more than 1 & half day.2) Very very good speed of apps and fingerprint sensor. Zero lag, I am using it now for more than a month.3) Ver good camera quality, indoor pics are really awesome, due to lockdown didn't get more chance to click outdoor photos more,  but whichever photos are clicked outdoors didn't see any kind of issues with picture quality.Overall after using it for more than a month, only I can say is pure satisfaction.

  Its been a month m using this mobile(Samsung M21 -  4GB,  68GB ).This is my second Samsung Mobile.(10 yrs back) My first Samsung Mobile was the reason i hated Samsung the most.But after using this one. I completely changed my mind. This mobile is awesome. Like its under ‚Çπ15k nd u r getting a mobile which is a Master piece.In this Range(under 15k).. I m Rating this mobile.Fingerprint reader(5 out of 5)Battery life (5 out of 5)Camera quality (5 out of 5)Sound quality(5 out of 5)Display quality(5 out of 5)There is only one prob with this mobile is that it takes 3hrs for complete charging (0 to 100). But this problem can be solved if u charge it during night. So in morning it will be 100. I recommend this mobile if u hv budget under ‚Çπ15k. Worth it.... Go for it.

"
"

  I'll go from bad qualities to some good ones1. Fingerprint sensor- Slow. Even my 3 year old motorola device have the faster fingerprint sensor. Rating-4/102. On hand feel- Poor, polycarbonate body doesn't feel like premium.Rating-3/102. Camera- Overall good but cannot take full screen aspect photos in the pixels they are advertising for.Rating- 8/103. UI interface- smooth and no ads with minimum blotwares as compared to realme and Xiaomi. Not as good as stock android but it can be when customised correctly.Rating- 9/104. Battery- MonsterRating- 10/10Display- Flagship level displayRating- 10/10Ram management- I have 6gb variant and it's management is good.Signal strength- normal to good. But it cannot catch the wifi that is little far away.Rating- 9/10

"
"

  Everything was smooth except camera of both rear and front i observed little more contrast in pictures apart from remaining all are decent.>battery life was good, one full charge remains for 1 full day and varies for normal using.>Finger,face unlock was quick and responsive.> Audio output with out stereo headphones was normal and with headphones as it contains dolby atmos audio quality was crystal clear, movie lovers can fully enjoy this experience.> Screen quality was so good it shows bright colours as it has super amoled display but out door has that lack of experience

  A Samsung M21 is an excellent budget friendly mobile phone which comes with a great battery powered with 6000MAH like a mini power bank. Am using it since 4 months personally, performance of the mobile is extremely fantastic mainly the samsung built-in features gives a best experience for user to handle any kind of mobile application very quickly and easily. This Samsung M21 loaded with an extraordinary 48MP+8MP+5MP camera which gives user to take a wonderful pictures and UHD 4K videos more over the fingerprint unlock and face unlock is super fast üëå. Over all performance is super excellent, just like a Monster üî•. I suggest and recommend everyone this mobile phone who are planning to purchase under 14000.

"

  Very good phone in 15000/16000 range. Samsung has developed a lot. Previously because of less storage & all phones used to get hanged. Now it has changed the way interms of storage, ram, etc.. to stay in market. Best phone from samsung. Only disadvantage is it only provides 15W fast charging only which takes more time to charge 6000 mah battery. Otherwise it has  Good camera, battery, beautiful display, good processor, user friendly user interface makes this phone a perfect one for all. I expect more like this from samsung üëçüëç

  I love this mobileSolid amoled displayThere is heating issue but then no seriousNetwork sometime goes down while changing place.I urge amazon executive to have a talk with samsung regarding samsung m21 heating issue.urge them to give update software.Over all its solid finish mobile.you will feel proudCamera is stunning but dont expect much in night shootWho says you cant play pubg yes u can there is limit 30 minutes is alrite then lag startsI recommend u all go for this model.

  Dear team,I have received a faulty product . I complained about the sound quality with in 10 days of receiving the product but I was said to visit service center. I went to the service center on 18.08.2020 (service request no-4308130896). According to them the speaker was replaced as it was faulty. Now from yesterday the touch of screen is not working suddenly. I have paid Rs-14k for the faulty product for which will I have to visit service center again and again? Are you justifying your brand name ? I will never visit service center again. I want my money back else I will have to go to consumer court. Looking forward your immediate reply.Regards,Arindam Chakraborty8527387313

  I using this Samsung brand 1st time , first impression to display and full body is amazing like we having one plus or other premium device. As feature mentioned I fall in love of display it's just unbelievable  at this price and compare to other brands direct difference  you can see between its display  and other IPS  LCD display .battery life is also good as mentioned .camera is awesome at day light shoot but camera is very very bad at night while using night shot option , software is also good , a lot of feature are packed in it, look is totally premium like you are handling a very expensive phone, physical design of the device is such that like it feel like thin body , and very easy handling .overall this is the premium device than any other brand device at this price , really good ..

  i always wanted to have a phone like it to last for whole day in single charge and this is it with more than 24 hour of battery backup,.........CAMERA is superb with good detailing wide view is nice and super slow motion with no lagg FRONT camera quality detailing is soo good bcz its 20mp and provide real pic ...NOT over MAKEUP sekup,amoled SCREEN is superb as it has more ppi so u will see minute detail, ....screen TOUCH response is quick i am sying it bcz it matters in GAMING...ya now gaming its good for gamming with slight lags ...very littel back fingrprint ohh relief fromm inside screen wala its better thn tht and NETWORK is also stable even in remote sites where i hv clicked tht pic frm it check that U WILL GET MORE THAN MONEY SPENT on it.....and the last a TIP ...first time charging might be bit slow ...but on second it charges in almost 2:30 to 2:50

"
"

  Positive: The phone is the best value for money option in its category. In comparison to M31, M31s and A51 (All samsung), at a much lower price we get almost same features except a slightly lesser camera quality and 2gb less RAM. Still a 48 MP camera and 6 GB ram is worth a buy.Negative: One thing that almost certainly made me cringe was the length of the USB charging cable. I mean sitting on my couch with the switch board just next to it, I cannot even use the phone. Its almost half of what I had with my previous Smasung phone, J7 Prime. I mean can't a company like Samsung afford a longer cable. Its a basic accessory. These small things matter a lot when it comes to customer satisfaction.

From day 1 I have touch screenissues. on 09/08/2020 phone touch screen fully not working.I suspect that I have received defective or used phones. below is my suspect1. package damage and not fully wrapped. refer attached photo.2. received airtel sim pouch without sim inside the package with MHmarked in pencil. refer attached image.I couldn't even restart my phone.Replacement policy before is 10 days and not aware of it being reducedto 7 days.

  i got mobile which is constantly overheating and draining battery without any usage in just 5 days of purchasei complaint it all about the problem and request for return i got call to install a app to analyse the problem ,but the app wants some pin to enter in that which no one knows about , Now AMAZON smartly engaged  me worthless process due to which i am now out of return period

"
"

  Although the battery is good once charged to full it survives for at least 2 days for normal use .but it takes too long to get fully charged from 0(approx 5 hrs)and thats too long as it is a fast charging model.Another issue is with network it is not showing the tower full as it used to be with ny earlier phone so there is a network issue with this phone.And the touch sensor is not that much smooth.rest all are ok

"
"

  ¬†Satisfied by the phone at this price range. Camera quality is pretty good, you can record slow motion videos, good micro lens capture, video stability is super amazing which is rare to see at this price. Performance is good. Fingerprint reader sensor needs improvement. I must say that this is one of the best option to buy at this price range.

  At price of 12,700 , super amoled display and 6000 mAh battery are highlights of this phone.Battery : 10/10Display  : 10/10Camera  : 8.5/10Perfomance (other than gaming) : 8.5/10I preferred  M21 over others in the same price segment because of display and battery  with thag you get good camera quality too.

"
"

  Well this phone is truly meant for all those who want a high performance phone for their daily purposes (not for heavy gaming).  It has a very fast and accurate fingerprint sensor, an outstanding FHD+ AMOLED display, a very brilliant camera, with a nyc and decent EXYNOS 9611 processor which is known for its speed and of course a very impressive 6000mAh battery for 2 day's use.  It can run the heavy games also as it has a brilliant processor but it's not meant for gaming.  If u need a phone for decent gaming, extraordinary camera and an amazing display for movies and vdos, this is just for u.

"
"

  It's probably the best product at this price. I have been using it for 4 weeks. Everything is fine but the battery life is not so amazing as I expected and the top part on back gets heated when you use Camera for a bit longer or when phone is charging (which is probably good thing I think) but except that its pretty much satisfactory especially when you consider its display quality....HAPPY SHOPPING....

"
"

  Used it for 7 days and returned back to amazon,things and problems i noted1) Battery life not good, it doesnot give 1 day back up also, charger of 15 w is not good. it takes more than 2 and half hr charge fully.2) Processor is very much slow, unable to operate fast.3) Internet interuption frquent with very slow opening of pages.this is 2nd time samsung frustrated me 1st samsung j7 in 2016-17 and now samsung m21.we does not need only hawabaaji (like6000 mah battery)... samsung have to think practically what they are making.

"
"

  Good in following aspects:1. AMOLED Display is simply amazing2. Good build quality3. Performance is goodModerate in following aspects:1. Camera is good but not great, photos and especially videos are grainy in medium light conditions (Low light is worse)2. Battery life is not as expected from 6000mAh. Hardly lasts a day (8hr on-screen time) when used with constant WiFi ON, a few hours of YouTube and WhatsApp (with no gaming). Majorly disappointed with this factor.3. Charging takes a very long time (0 - 100% takes around 2.5 - 3hrs)4. Fingerprint sensor gets smudgy with little usage

"
"

  Samsung m21 is best phone I ever used.  In my samsung m21 best thing is samsung one UI and d camera. both works awesome . UI is so user friendly and full of  features. You got adiccted that so quick. About camera, it works awesome as compony said. It,s slow mo I like most and have all necesary features. And yes battery is also awesome. I have heavy uses of internet n it last long about one and half day.  Super amoled display, 6GB ram, fast charger  all are work best for you. The fingerprint is not that fast but it works good I have no any complaints about it. If have you want rich features and standard brand smartphone in your budget then surely you should buy this . It will not disappoint you.

"
"

  Waited for a while before writing this review. A very sturdy phone at a good price - not much into gaming so I cant comment on the gaming part. However, we have been using this for movies, songs and the usual apps - whatsapp, facebook, instagram, gpay etc. Battery life is good and lasts for almost an entire day. No earphones provided in the box - I think Samsung should consider that. Camera is good - colours are captured well. Not a professional one but its too much if you are expecting a hi-funda camera at this price.Overall - value for money.

  I order this phone on 20 julyYesterday on 3 august phone is not working touch is not workingSuch a bad product i recieved i have wasted my 14000 on this cheap phoneI want my money back or replace by new phoneI suggest no one to buy this phone

"
"

  I got this phone yesterday and I am using it continously.I was using motorola phone previously so I confused to buy motorola or Samsung but my friend suggest me to buy this phone as I did and I am satisfied with my decision.About phone:Battery works whole day but in night you need to charge if used continously.For normal work it will works 2 days on single chargeCamera looks good as pr 48MP I  expect a bit moreFront camera is also good.Display and fingerprint is awesomeTouch is smoothAnd design and comfort while holding a phone is amazingIt feels great to have a powerful monster in your handThis phone is really a monster in terms of specifications.Thanks hope this review helps you to buy a better phone in this range.

"
"

  overall it was an average buy product because of battery life. it seems that it has only 4000 MaH battery usually drained out within 36 hours with below regular usage .fast charging  also is just a name with this product it took 4 hours to charge the product full.camera result was fair . its not 41mp as its written in description of product.phone weight is bit heavy.not so happy with product

"
"

  A very good phone if you're not a hardcore gamer, Exynos 9611 does the job for you if you're a moderate user. I ever played Asphalt  9 in the phone for 1h and it was working quite good.Camera is one of the best under 15K and a little bit of heating while playing Asphalt 9 but no overheating. Battery backup is good passes the full day with 30% battery remaining in my use.If you're hesitating to buy it like I was then go for it if you're not a hardcore gamer and make sure to buy a back cover along with the phone.Things which you get only in this phone under 15K1) FHD+ sAMOLED display2) Your own private VPN using Samsung Max3) Dolby Atmos for music lovers

"
"

  Seriously I am the one who only use high end phones but the performance I got from this phone is too good. For battery it takes 2hrs approximate time to get fully charged but gives you more than 8hrs backup with 1-2 hrs pubg game play. About PUBG the phone provides very good performance and also doesn't heatup if someone says so. I am using this phone for a week know and it is very satisfying and up to the mark. About body you'll see that most of tha YouTuber says that it has boring looks and a plastic back but I don't agree with them. Yes it has plastic back but apart from that it looks Very good in hands. And about screen one thing there is no competition for Samsung when it comes to screen. For this much price you can't expect any more good phone than what Samsung gives. Don't hesitate if love this phone just buy it. Thanks

  1. Camera Quality very good (AR emoji ,Slow motion ,hyper lapse ) and we can edit background option after clicking photo .2. Battery massive 600mAH with 15W fast charger takes 150 minute  to full charge and impressive thing is power modes by one UI  a. maximum power saving mode where you can select apps to run (4+4 app(default)) i always use maximum power saving mode with (whataspp,youtube,gmail and camera)  b. medium power saving mode3.  Display  FULL HD SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY give best viewing experience and supports dark mode, blue light filter , always on display4. you can uninstall bloatware apps and also disable some apps which you don not use frequently .

"

  This product is Awesome when i compared to the 'Samsung M40' because  M40 is not sAmoled.It has a better camera and i liked it very much.It has a good processor and i played the game PUBG with it and it is an awesome experience for me.It has a monster battery of 6000mAh and it is long lasting compared to my samsung A20 and samsung J8.Its fingerprint scanner is much better than my other devices.When i use camera it gives me a wonderful experience.It suprises me when i take slo-mo and super slow-mo videos.Its video quality is amazing its 4K video recording and super steady mode works much better than others.Its quality is better when i take selfies in my phone.The gaming experience of playing game is realy amazing.Its specs is cheaper to others at this range.Overall it is a amazing phone

"
"

  It's amazing. The phone is really good and it never lags in everyday usage. There is screen  flash in front camera and alongwith split screen it also  has pop up view for multitasking. The battery backup is amazing and the phone plays alot of games without lag like nova legacy and asphalt nitro and simcity. The charging time is adequate keeping in mind its massive 6000 mah battery. The camera is really amazing and bixby vision along with a r emoji are great features that I loved. One UI is the best and is completely ad free. There are no spammy notifications and the notification settings are pretty easy to handle. The dark mode is perfect and no words for the brilliant display quality üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

"
"

  Overall mobile features are awesome. But front and back camera is really really really really awesome. In this price they are giving  really good quality pics pic size me mostly more than 3 MB I am very much impressed with camera. It click pic like where you do not need higher quality camera and no need to edit using paid software.

"
"

  One of the best mobile phones you can buy in this price range. Display is fabulous, Camera is above average, battery lasts a day with average usage(multimedia, social media and mediocre gaming), only thing that concerned me was the charging time, though it has a fast charger it took me around 3 hours to charge the device from 0-100 which does make sense because it‚Äôs a 6000mah battery, but Samsung should provide a better charger along with it. Overall the product is amazing, worth the buy!

"
"

  Frustrated with so many ad and notifications  in my old MI phone and mi phone have many  preinstalled mi apps which is not required at all. Who knows this chinese company xioami is stealing our personal and confidential  data also.This time "" SAMSUNG phone"" which is ad free. This model is  best budget  phone, with good battery life  and with good  camera quality. This is one of the best phone for normal  user like me.

"
"

  I love this cell phone one, and this is best.1. Looks wise very attractive slim design very gud camera and full clarity photos.2.Super amloed  display with full hd.3. 6000 Mh  battery backup of 2 to 3 days.4. A very good phone at reasonable price5.Android 10 with latest One UI features.6.Finger print reader and face lock very fast recognise within a second.Launching of phone was delayed due to lockdown what to our bad luck otherwise it would be soon in our hand..Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world.No Second thought just go get it...... for a wonderful experience

"
"

  The phone is worth the Money, the AMOLED display is available in costly model in other brand except Vivo, however Vivo has drawback less MP camera, 20 MP front camera for this process unbeatable, charging is fast, 6000 mah battery last long, no other is having 6000 mah battery

"
"

  Lets get to businessPROS-6k mah with dark mode on easily lasts 2 days.-good camera for daylight photography.-best in segment display with punchy black colour.-no heating issue.One ui is far better than miui and realme os,its highly optimized.- 9611 is 10nm processor which is enough for mediocre gaming.Cons- should have given atleast support for 25 watt charging.- could have given a punch hole like in m11,feels little 2019'ish.- dopby atmos makes no difference l,sound is average.ConclusionDont go for poco m2 pro or other realme mi devices, trust me m series with this good display and ui will definitely  never make u regret ur decision.Thnks 4 reading

  ¬†A real good mobile phone at this price. Bought both M21 128GB and M21 64 GB. The first one is for me and the second one for my sister on her birthday ‚ù§Camera quality is really nice as you can see the above pictures. Superslow motion is also good.Battery life is good and charging is fast. No heating issues till now.Processor is fast. No lagging.Fingerprint reader never fails.I have been using samsung since last 6 years. Never got disappointed.

"
"

  Some things can be improved in this price range, though 4GB RAM is enough for usage unless you play game more frequently.People often think more RAM means greater performance and they miss to compare the CPU which in my opinion is even more important factor. A CPU which can utilise 6GB RAM will be much better than a CPU which can utilise 4GB RAM even if latter contains 8GB RAM.

"

  Fingerprint reader- Not even a second to unlock after your finger recognitionFace unlock -this too is best $ best one just a second after the click of home button and it will take you directly to the home screenBattery Life-Absoultely it is 6000 MAH so no need to talk about its performance . I got my phone 29 percent charged and I used it continusly more than a hour and Still 5% was leftüòãCamera quality is also good in this price rangeAnd the loveliest thing about this phone is #LOOK_OF_THE_PHONE really...Its amazing phoneGo for it without any Doubts üëçüëçCharger supports 15w fast charging..it takes a hour for 100% charge

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is sometimes not accurate&speed.Because fingerprints reader is square flat design& fingerprints is smug the sensor.Battery is very best for traveller.Heavy task doing Absolutely stands for 1 Day.But Charging time is (0-100%) during approx.3Hrs20min in 15W box adapter.doing Heavy task slightly heating is present.It is normal heating issue.But Brand give any update.It will fix to future.camera performance is very best.But Brand will give any flagship updates.It's Perfectly 100% worth for money compare to other.Super Amoled display,smooth touch display,good Battery life,good camera performance,security, super software&Best chipset is Absolutely Best for money in this segment.I recommend to buy this smartphone.It's very amazing.Thanks to Samsung.

  When i want to buy a new phone, iam searching all the company mobiles finally brought samsung galaxy m21 due to features like 6000mah battery, camera and display ext. After using this phone iam really very happy about battery life because iam watching more movies. Camera quality also good . Finger print sensor is fast responding. Movie lovers blindly go for this.

"

  Waste of money1.VERY POOR battery backup2.Very low camera quality3. SENSOR not working properly.4. No any advance features like redmi5.No network coverage or capture quality.6.Slowness in buttons selection time like ‚óèIt take more time for data on or off . ‚óèIt take to switch on torch .7.No more extra features for image or video8 Total waste of moneyMost worst thing is that earphone pungin in bottom side ,This is very irritating and difficult to watch video in simple way , You have to always watch video with earphone in full screen.Very disappointed .

"
"

  Bought Samsung Galaxy M21 during exchange offer and surprisingly it turned out to be a worth purchase. Camera quality, battery backup and UI is quite impressive as compared to other budget mobiles from samsung. If you're looking for a mobile for basic use for phone calls it's a must buy.

"
"

  The phone is really good and above all it's better to buy a Samsung phone rather than any Chinese phone.. I got it for my father and he is happy with its performance.. He mostly surfs FB and watches YouTube videos. With superamoled panels you get the best and the battery life is really good.. The processor is better than Sd 665.. At this price Samsung gives u amoled screen and a monster battery

"
"

  I am using the phone for the last 3 weeks, and here are my reviews:1) looks are ok types with its blue plastic back. Back cover is highly recommend.2) The best thing about this phone is it's S-Amoled display. Full HD screen takes this display to a higher level.3) The back camera does a great job while the front camera is also good without any question.4) Battery is also good but charging time is a little high. It takes about one and a half hour to fully charge it. Battery drains a little fast when the data is on.5) Headphone jack in my phone has become a little lose.6) Fingerprint scanner is ok but it has some problem when it is used to open WhatsApp.Overall it is a good phone in this budget for medium to light users.

  Camera: 3star; nowhere close to 48MP, maybe 13-6M. Camera has nice features which are attractive but overall quality it not upto the mark.Sound: 1star; Worst experience with any mobile device in 10yrs of usage. Even 5k mobiles sounds better than this.Display: 5star; It is upto the mark, really liked it.Battery: 5star; Very Good backup + fast charging as expected.Performance: 3star; Apart from very slow start-up time and slow touch response/reception, i didn't had any other issues till now.

  Got defective item,  after 20 days touch screen stopped working, went to Samsung services center there said need to replace touch screen.As it was in warranty period, there did it for free but after a week... again touch stopped working, when we ask what was the problem has it's a new item just 1 month old there said it's defective device.. i ask for exchange but there refuse as it was brought from Amazon.I contacted Amazon, there said contact Samsung, i went to Samsung there said ask Amazon... so this is my experience.

"
"

  I would like to give only 2 star to this phone because of its speed n space. I bought this phone for sufficient space, speed n camera. But camera colour correction is poor. If u take picture of any thing sea green it's result will be sky blue. Means for  peetal or light colours it's camera totally fails. In comparison even with Resume Note 5 pro there very few feathers. If we talk about Battery it takes 2 to 3 hours to be fully charged. Touch pad is also not at par. Overall in comparison of quality it's cost is too high. Above all there no return or exchange facility.  If you wish to buy this phone for camera, long power and soothing touch pad, this mobile phone can be bad choice.

"
"

  Its very big mistek of meVery poor phone of samsung m21Battery 6000mah its total lie its backup only half day  not a gamer only fb or whatsup and call use so samsung batery not good its zeroNo screen recoderIts 6gb ram but very slowNetwork connection poor all sim like jio,airtel and vodafone checkSo my review dont purchase this phone

"
"

  There's nothing to dislike about this phone, its a awesome purchase in this price range, Massive Battery runs for 2 days easily, Excellent Camera, Beautiful Samoled display, Light weight, Superior build quality.I was earlier a bit confused about its performance because many reviewers said that it has slow processor but i didn't find any lag whatsoever in regular usage and fingerprint reader is also fast.And the best part is OneUI, its super smooth and has all the features we need in a UI and no vulgar ads like other manufacturers.So definitely this phone deserves 5 stars overall in every department.You should buy this phone immediately without thinking twice.

  Value for MoneyGalaxy M30s is exact same , it is cheaper than that.No Doubt it is value for money.A good option as it is non-chinese too.A great deal for 14k bucks.SoPros:1.Corning Gorilla Glass 32.Super Amoled FHD Display with U-Notch3.Great Battery4.Camera is Above Average .5.Fast Fingerprint SensorCons:1. Build Quality (Plastic Back Panel )2.Processor ( so called Exynos 9611)3. Feels Bulky.4. No Integrated Hardware for security.5. One UI core instead of Full One UI.Caution: No Earphones , Case and Screen Guard present in the Box , don't forget to order them too!

  Very good mobile.Battery life is extraordinary. For a normal user you can simply get two days.screen is stunning as usual.Mobile is good to handle in the palm.Front Camera is very good.Back camera should have been improved little.Overall if you are not a gamer, the mobile is a decent purchase in this price range.

  Very heavy and not so faster processor as mentioned in the spec.I used to keep this phone in my pants while cycling and suddenly the touch broken has developed a bend and the the touch screen had to be replaced.When I go to the service center they say, you give the phone to them and they will give a coupon deducting the value of damaged touch screen (Rs. 5500) . So I will get only 7500. Just in 1 month. Very poor build quality don't go for this mobile.Pathetic service by Samsung. I regret buying this phone.

  Had the worst experience with the phone received this phone on 7 july 2020 and the phone started giving trouble from 25 july 2020 only after some software update. Deposited it on the service center and they took more than 15 days saying it's an issue with the motherboard, once it came back it again gave trouble from next day onwards only. It switches off automatically then switches on and in this process gets heat up and then if by mistake is restored back to normal gets hang.Also the seller that is selling this product is also not very good. They had some technical issue which is why the delivery was delayed by a week.Overall worst experienceDON'T PURCHASE

  Finger print reader doesn't work 90% of the times which leads to severe inconvenience.I have heard the same issue across other models also and there is no permanent fix.I wonder what quality check it has passed.  It is a breach of trust that A leading manufacturer cheating customers to this extent by selling a handset on which they couldnt design n ensure most critical security feature to work as expected.There is no other issue in mobile apart from this but this issue can't be ignored as 1. it's most important feature required as one has to struggle every single time to unlock screen2. Samsung knowingly selling this substandard product for which they don't have fix

"
"

  Overall this phone is very good. The camera quality is the best. I am not a heavy user, so the phone's battery lasts for 2 days.  Its display is crisp and clear. Fingerprint works very fast and smooth. The phone works smoothly. I suggest Samsung M21 for those people who are looking for a good and decent phone under 15k.

  After 13 days of use I would like to write something about this smartphone........First thing is that this is a non-chinese smartphone & Samsung company also manufacture smartphones in INDIA.Secondly this smartphone full fill my wish.Thirdly the performance of Exynos 9611 steal my üíì heart.Awesome camera quality,long battery backup win my wish. Fingerprint reader is also very quick.Fourthly it comes with super AMOLED display & Corning gorilla glass 3 protection.Sound is loud and quality is good.There are many hidden tips & tricks available in this smartphone.#proud of my own choice.

  I am writing this after a week use. This is really a good phone with this price range..camera is good..battery life is good..doesn't feels like it's a 6000 mah battery but it lasts easily for 1 n half day in normal usage. It won't give u a premium feeling as after applying cover it becomes a bit bulky. Finger print is good almost 1 sec is the time for identifying the print. speakers are good display is awesome...no lags in opening the applications. There is no heating problem so far. All sensors are up to the mark n do justice with the price.Over all a good purchase. It doesn't comes with gorilla glass n cover hence don't forget to order those as well while purchasing this.

"

  Delivery - I bought this on 7th August and it arrived on next day morning . No issues with delivery .Packaging - Atleast could have bubble wrap the box  but no such type of protection was present.Device InformationDisplay - The famous Super AMOLED display is amazing .Camera - Can't stop taking photos with that one .Fingerprint Reader - To be true , the reaction could have improved .Battery - Can't tell at this stage cause the phone is learning my daily usage pattern but still it has massive 6000mAh battery and it comes with super fast 15 watt super fast charger.Apart from that , I like the user interface which is simple and easy to use .Hopefully ,I will review this product a month later  for issues .

  Regret buying Samsung galaxy M21. Very poor build quality,worst part is screen panel and back panel lock is not aligned due to this gap of at least 1mm is visible.Except AMOLED screen nothing is worth for mentioning.Battery hardly lasts 12 hrs with voice calling only. Takes lot of time to charge. Charger USB cable very short.Don't fall prey to YouTube reviews ,which are promoted by Samsung.Finger print is just for unlocking purpose only. Can't attend calls/take photos etc.No dedicated music & video player, depend on third party apps which are loaded with ads.Enormous heating, sometimes can't keep on ear.Used S3 back in 2013, just wanted to see any quality improvement but NO.According to me it should have been around 10K only.Reverting to my old Huawei P30 Lite, which is far far better than Samsung.

"
"

  Actually first time I am using this Samsung  company cellphone.  Earlier I was using redmi phone where there was a issue of storage and it was hanging continuously.This Samsung galaxy  m21 has good camera, features , display, storage and easy to use and overall  I found it is best.This phone has good look , broad display and sensor.It's been for last three months I am using this phone. This review is based on the experience from last 3 months.Most importantly  battery life is good remains for 2 days even after using most of the time in those 2 days.Camera quality is good both front as well as rear.Worth buying.

"
"

  It looks great. But unfortunately mine stopped working after about 3 weeks with some issue with registering in the network. The Samsung service center folks were very unprofessional, did not register my complaint officially in the system and instead working with handwritten acknowledgement slips. They initially tried reloading the software and then said the motherboard will have to be replaced.I am now back with my old workhorse that has been working relentlessly for almost about 5 years now, not Samsung of course. I will be wary now.

"
"

  I bought it for my Dad. I felt jealous though I've A50 6 GB version bt seeing it's battery life. üòÖThe best budget phone ever.I really love samsung as I use it for various business purposes. Text shortcut option is very useful. I always store some long posts on just one word and when I type it gives the full post to share with my customers faster. That's why I exchange my old samsung phone with new one and also bought this phone for my dad.

"
"

  Best phone in this price... If you want to buy a non Chinese product..... Its battery backup is too good and screen is also best.... Sound quality and gaming things are also best... The only con is its camera....you will see blurry images often and.... Shutter speed is little slow if you want to capture a moving object it will be blurry..... It can be optimized by software update.... Hope Samsung will fix their camera ui and other problems soon...... And also in Pro mode there are not so much option you can say pro mode is also like auto mode

"
"

  There may be other smartphones in this range like Realme, Redmi, Vivo, Oppo etc offering more features . Before buying one may usually go for one of these keeping in mind the features they offer. But they are doing just Badge Marketing with same piece of materials under different names. Samsung though may offer a bit less on the processor side but the hardware material and basically the only thing that matters the most to me is the Screen Quality. Really soothing to eyes as compared to these other mobiles. And talking about this phone, its battery,camera,screen quality, even processor are really good. One not wanting some hardcore gaming, can definitely go for this product !

"
"

  I am writing this review after about a week of owning the M21, the first thing I would like to mention is that the battery life is just amazing. I charge my phone once in 2 days. Watched Netflix for 3 hours and drained only about 10% battery.The camera quality is okay, some advanced features are available, so you don't exactly feel that it's a budget phone - but if you are only looking for a phone with excellent cam - you might not like it that much. finger print reader is quite fast and efficient, the phone is in itself fast and no issues of slowness observed this far.All in all a nice phone in this price which is not a Chinese made phone, if you know what I mean :)

"
"

  ****Do not buy it..I repeat..do not buy it and that too from Amazon..!!I purchased the phone and It got frozed in 2 days, multiple times started and restarted and then screen touch issue with it.On calling Amazon thrice as they keep on dropping off the calls, I have been asked to wait for a technician even though I was within timeline of returning the product..complete mental harrasment of customer and ignorance from Amazon...***Worst Phone ordered from Pathetic App

"
"

  Best Smartphone from Samsung with best the market value üî•a purely made in india product of smasung from its biggest manufacturing unit in NOIDA üî•The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate and the best part is its battery which lasts for 2 days .The camera looks great in this price segment. Overall its a BEASTüî•

"
"

  ""The best phone in the Market"" , The best phone most probably under its segment INR 15,999.. The battery life is decent, 6000mah..... 2 days with regular usage and the Camera Quality is best With Good Quality Photos, video, photo Stability and best focus... If You are a student and choosing a Phone ,this is the best choise under its segment.. More of a part this Phone is better than Redmi note 9 pro.. and trust me this Phone is 100 percent indian as it's made in Haryana, Samsung Plant, India...And if you are a gamer than you can also go for it as it has best battery, Best display(Samsung's S Amoled Display), and best display Ratio..**THIS IS A HONEST REVIEW AFTER 2 MONTHS OF REGULAR USAGE**THANK YOU SAMSUNGTHANK YOU AMAZON

  Samsung M series is totally disappointing. M21 has issue with WIFI range, it is very short range & does not work beyond few metres. Call dropping is also an issue. Samsung UI, which is praised by you Tuber is also disappointing. It does not have basic feature like app lock. Screen lock widget is available but you need to enable smart ball. To cut the long story short except battery backup handset is waste.

"
"

  Amazon delivery agent was so patient as he called me multiple times during delivery of the product as I didn't picked his call due to some other issue. Thanks a lot Amazon.M21.. Finger print reader I m not convinced for this price range..my previous mobile moto one macro was 4k less than this mobile but finger print reading was so quick and accurate. Not sure if this is issue mine or all other users are experiencing the same.I m pleased with both Camera and Battery quality. Even with natural light Camera does great jobSince this mobile equipped with Android is and good processor... multi tasking does not have long. I recommend to go for it

"
"

  This product is a overall good package and 6GB 128 GB is definitely my favourite variant. The main screen is amoled and actually gives you a rich feel. It's all specifications mentioned are upto the mark.But the major thing I disliked in the phone is it's back body as it catches a lot of fingerprints and takes on scratches, over all built quality which you can see in Samsung mobiles is anyways a bit on lower side which this variant has too. Back cover is a must. Could have included back case cover with handset itself.

"
"

  Not a big fan of Samsung. 1st time ever purchased a Samsung phone. And it didn't disappoint me.Few things wanted to share:1. Display quality is good.2. Battery life is good. I m getting around 8-9 hours of SOT.3. Samsung UI is very fast and fluid.4. Camera is avg. Not best in this price. Selfie could have been better.5. Processor is good for multitasking and multimedia consumption. Not for high end games. I didn't expect at this price range.6. Call quality is good.Final verdict: if you are looking for a phone with good battery and ad free ui then go for it.

"
"

  Overall very goood phone..I m playing pubg in this phone in medium setting...even at starting I was playing pubg in higher settings but after 2-3 hours cotinuous playing...I felt it is slowing....soo after alll in medium setting there is no lag no slow problem and also there is no heating prblm...in starting it's camera was littile bit slow ...but after new update there is no slowlyness.......Battery is awesome...even after fully charge..I m playing pubg seeing videos on youtube and movies also...so after hard usage it's battery drain after 1 day or approx one and a half day extra...After all phone is very good....there is no hanging problem...no lagging problem....

"
"

  The wrost mobile even not upto mark with the quality. Patches started coming in display after use of 15 days and Samsung is saying it is internal damage so that can't help in replace and repair. It will chargeable. Now to they asking to pay 5000. A 15 days new phone is required to pay 5000 where there is no physical damage and nothing means a question mark of quality of products and brand value of Samsung. So please don't go for this product , totally money and time waste. Phone even didn't last for 3 week.

"
"

  A great smartphone from SAMSUNG. If you are a multimedia lover then this phone is a must buy option. Having a great camera set 48mp 8mp 5mpwhich makes it a camera phone also and also having many camera features like slow, super slow, night mode etc. Coming to battery ,it is a real monster. 6000 mAh expands your mobile using time. It gives a long lasting battery life about a day. Having Super Amoled FHD+  display views everything colorful. Dolby atmos gives fully theatrical expirience while watching movies. If you are a medium gamer ,it mathes you perfectly. But it does not mathes for a heavy gamer! Having Exynos 9611, smoothenes the day to day using expirience.Laslty i say it is a worthy mobile which covered eveey aspect of mobile buying...

"
"

  As a first time Samsung phone user, It is a great experience and I'm totally satisfied with this product, and really worthful to buy at the available price. I'm writing a review after using my phone for a week.Screen: AMOLED screen bring you a new experience and really amazed by UI display.Sound: The sound quality is good but the volume is medium-low for the speaker.Battery: Very slow charging and took me more than 4 hrs to fully charged.At last, It's about my camera, the picture quality is good, even though I'm facing glitches like showing a black screen for some clicked pics.Thanks, Amazon for timely delivered my product during this pandemic.

"
"

  This phone is literally amazingIt has good back camera which helped me in taking beautiful shots, but it needs improvement in its selfie camera.It has best battery as it worked 3 days non stop on decent usage.One UI is one of the best Android skin provided by Samsung.It's display quality is excellent and good for watching movies and YouTube videos.Its processor is decent ,only for normal usage, not suitable for gaming.Overall this phone is for productivity purpose.

  I bought the Samsung Galaxy M21 6GB & 128 Gb version at price of 15499 and I am in love with this phone.I am using this for last one and half month and found it is a good phone in this price range.It comes with a wide display of 6.4 inch with AMOLED display and HD+ resolution.It has a Samsung exenos 9611 octacore processor which makes multitasking smooth.Operating system is Android 10 which is the latest version of Android.Though it has a 6000 mAh batary it dose not feel bulcky and it gives a backup of around full-day after regular use.Also it has type C 15W fast charger but it could be a little moreThough it has a 48MP camera but the photos are not quite impressive.it also has a 20MP high resolution selfy scooter.

  Writing this review after one month of usage.Pros:1.Exceptional battery life.2.Good camera quality.3.Lag free day to day usage.4.Awesome display(samoled)5.Hustle free OS(no ads like xiaomi)6.Light weight for one handed use( even though it has a massive battery )Cons:1.Heating issue(if you are a heavy user)2.Plastic body3.No case provided4.Takes lot of time to charge5.Not that fast biometric unlock but okConclusion:For a normal user this phone is a gem.Games can be played smoothly but not for long hours.Clicks beautiful selfies and good quality pictures.Super slow motion available.Overall a good all-round performance for the one who wants a phone inside the budget.

"
"

  Battery is excellent and phone is of lite weight considering its 6000mah battery,camera claims to be 48mp but pixel 12mp camera are far better than this one, processor is ok but Snapdragon would have been better choice,phone comes with Android 10 with lots of customized option from Samsung and unwanted apps few of them can be disabled n uninstalled.It has dual SIM with WiFi calling which can be enabled on both sim and a separate slot for SD card. Got phone for 12500rs it's a great buy for this price range.

"
"

  Got my m21 on 6 July but on 4 August it stopped working it is not getting charged.Made me upset.Besides this all features are very good.Cristal clear display and camera.Big battery do not let me down.Best but I feel trouble.

"
"

  Its a Great phone in this price range . i have used many other companies but samsung beats them. only the thing is that exynos processors are not that effective or that power like snapdrag or mediatek since it is samsungs own processor.For this mobile - I say everything is just great it has been given 2.0 core al gaming booster which provides more smoothness for games. and quad core camera with 5cm depth and 48mp lens and wide angle mode.

"

  This review is about samsung galaxy m21, I am writing this review after 2 months of usage,Pros,1. Good Battery performance2. SAmoled display is awesome3. Updation on camera i.e Single Take feature is awesome in budget mobile basically it will be in high end variant4. Processor: Exynos 9611 - well to play normal games and good for normal usage5. Display size: 6.4 inchesCons,1. Look like cheap back panel2. Some shake sound in back camera while keeping in the normal surface. We have to handle carefully.Overall, Good to buy with this brand.

"
"

  No doubt the product is very excellent in every aspects but its lacking in after sales services. I have both galaxy m21 and m31 and both are now having the same issue related to charging PCB. Fast charging is not connected and after i have contacted the service center they told me that PCB are not available for both of the phones and company will return your whole amount as per your bill.Im really pissed off with Samsung's M series of smartphones. They do have reliable series of smartphones under 20k but they do lack of after sales services. (ONLY M SERIES)BLINDLY GO FOR THESE PRODUCTS BUT MAKE SURE THAT AFTER SALES SERVICES RELATED TO PARTS AVAILABILITY IS PATHETIC AND THEY WILL ONLY HAVE OPTION TO RETURN YOUR WHOLESOME MONEY BACK.

  After 2 months of usageSevere heating issues if the fan isn't on what ever ur doin the phone will heat Very severe heating issue and the charging speed is very low they give the biggest battery in the market and the most slowest charger possible with a good for nothing tag saying fast charging which is bullshit it takes more more than 2¬Ω hours to normally fully charge it and around 3hrs to charge from 10 to 100The display is nice but the battery back up not very exceptional the camera quin daylight is very good in low light is garbageIt has good in hand feel thoPersonally i think exynoss proccecors are uselessI recommended not to buy it

"
"

  Phone is Good but I m facing problem of  phone Hotspot,  ist not connected with laptop because hotspot not showing in Laptop.

"
"

  Best from Samsung at this budget , the AI in phones camera is the best thing of all.And the display is awesome as always by Samsung.The Processor is good for multitasking.Games like pubg and COD work OK.Battery is awesome , 18 W charger is good but more was expected.Fingerprint is good enough...Overall at this budget you can't expect anything more from Samsung so a great value for moneyüëç.

"
"

  Please do not purchase this phone Or i would say any phone from samsung, they are in hurry to launch products without having a quality checks in place. They don't have any spare parts available in samsung customer care. I purchased the phone and within 10 days screen response was not working, went to customer care and they informed it needs a screen replacement and it's already more than a week, they haven't rectified the same.Nw again the same pblm and today again went to submit in samsung service center now again wait for15 days and nw they r saying we have to change the mother board. New phone and in only 1 mth the ph was with me only 10 days and all the time at samsung service center. Don't purchase from amazon. Amazon is giving u bad products

"
"

  Writing after using the phone for 2 months.Camera - awesome quality, different different modes,  drawback - no control over shutter speed, focus in pro modeBattery- very very good but takes a little longer to chargeFingerprint sensor - quick and well but sometimes stuckRAM - 2 GB is available to useROM - 40 GB is available to use after system servicesOVERALL I LIKED THE PRODUCTSOME CONS -1. It gets heated after use for 3 -4 hrs2. Sometimes hang like hell even without any gaming app

"
"

  First of all its been a pleasure doing business with samsung i got more than what i expected from my samsung galaxy m21.The battery life easily last a day with heavy usage and 2 days with light usage i can call of duty mobile on high graphics without frame rate drops .The mobile runs smoothly without any lags ,and i like the fact that samsung has promised us two major updates.The gorilla glass is scratch resistant.Super Amoled display rocks.Overall best phone its range.

"
"

  After using it for 3 days I must  say that this phone is good ..it has superb features..as it has 6000 mh battery so  not drain quickly ..camera Is good ..rear camera is better but selfi cam is not so good as I thought being 20mp in front is not like 20 mp ..but still I concluded that this phone is good at this price range..go for it..

"
"

  First, let me start with the phone battery. On a single full charge, it allowed me to use the phone for 2 full days. I spent around 4 hours on calls, and 8 hours of apps and browsing, 4 hrs of music using headset. I give my 5* for the battery. Both front and back cameras are awesome. The pics felt much better than my Note 8. From display & ease of usage perspective, I also use a Galaxy Note 8, and from the ease of usage and other features, this phone is as fast as that. Also, the audio quality is really good. The biggest bonus was to see that this was Made in India! If you need excellent quality along with Samsung reliability, this phone is a steal for the price of 14k. Go for it without any second thoughts, and you would love it, just like I do!

"
"

  Purchased the phone on 18th May and the quality of phone is way above the price range. The touch screen is as good as any top range phone. The processing speed is good enough to play any games. The best feature is wifi calling as I have poor indore mobile network but due to wifi calling I am able to make phone calls without having to go out.

"
"

  if you live/work in an area where network coverage isnt very good, avoid this phone.on the other hand its good for places with top class network as SAR is low.

"
"

  Battery excellent.Camera good in day light.but very bad at night.I can't zoom front camera.finger print started lagging  after 15 days.dolby atmos works only with headphone or bluetooth. No ambient light so auto brightness  works slow.Overall good deal with good display.

"
"

  The battery of this mobile is not seems according to its directed capacity. This mobile takes about 3 hours to charge in closed mode, but it is not working according to 6000 MAH. As it is being told to watch 26 hours of video on Amazon's website, but after one hour watching video, 1-1.5 hour talking and some 30 minutes video calling and remaining time in sleep state. The battery reached 30% in 18 hours. I will check the battery capacity from all sources, if it is not found according to 6000 mAh then I will take legal action against .I have taken this mobile phone at a price of about 1300-1500 more than the price of the last 40 days of Amazon. Taking advantage of the China dispute, Amazon / Samsung immediately increased the price of this mobile. This is a fraud with Indians.

  I am working with a multinational providing automotive retail solutions. In this covid time no any options available except work from home. We are using online meeting platforms like zoom, webex Microsoft Microsoft Team, Google meet. I was fed up with my old mobile to take battery recharging So after lot of study decided to purchase this product and I am extremely happy with the performance. So in my view this is not only mobile this is a solution for working people. Purpose makes this product perfect. This is also very handy and lightweight. Thanks Samsung for giving me solution by launching this product!

  ¬†Samsung M21 used for 5days.after 5 days ,phone is hanged after charging..charging issue in mobile... Taking 4-5 hours sometime.mobile heat up too much even in simple video playing.Screen touch start misbehaving and not working in 50percent area.Ultimately thanks to Amazon customer support who help me to return this product..I m not getting replacement due to delete of primary address as said by customer executive...Guys, There is issue on M21I. Charging time is too high for mammoth battery.2.Touch stop working in my case3. Heating issur

"
"

  I have bought this phone in June 2020 and just after 12 days of delivery, my phone had started lagging and the whole touch screen was interrupted. I mean it was totaly run by auto-control. I left the phone switched off for 3 days then it started working well but again after 15 or 18 days of first demerit, the 1.5 inch of the screen above from the charging end was not working. I mean its touch screen was totally interrupted.  One more thing about its battery power that the battery is not like 6000mAH as it should be, even I do not play PUBG or any other games. Otherwise the camera quality is very good. The only problem is of touch screen which is the worst problem because smartphones are all about touch screen first.

"
"

  To bycott chinease mobiles,bought samsung M21.It is Ok i can say,but as usual by samsung i feels phone get hangs/slow while operating multiple apps that never happend with my earlier Mi Note4.Definately battery is not of 6000 mah even battery back up also not matches with 4000 mah.Conclusion:Samsung need to improve lot of things in budget phones to standout wth competitors.

"
"

  I liked the product. But first time  I was dissatisfied with battery . It takes 3.5 hours to charge and drains very quickly.so I went for replace. Amazon replaced the phone within 2 days. But when I received the new one ,batteryis quite ok. But I can't hear the voice without headphones or speaker mode. I complained Amazon  , but they are now not ready to replace or return the deffective  phone. They checked online and said everything  looks  great.  I contacted Samsung, they said u go to Amazon. But after 2 days stress  I went to samsung service center and finally they cleaned the receiver and everything  is now ok.The worst experience i suffered from Amazon.so be careful about purchasing electronic item online via Amazon.

"
"

  Very disappointed , I used just three days, the mobile phone hang and navigation key not working ,I go to nearest samsung authorised service center the samsung mobile service man check the mobile then asked me the mobile phone display and software problem so you claim Amazon 7 days replacement warranty, so  I claim Amazon replacement warranty but the Amazon service too bad my mobile service appointment 6.9.20 but the appointment date automatically change 10.9.20 without any information me for Amazon then I called Amazon help line  the problem was not solved I felt very hungry so  please don't buy this samsung product and don't purchase Amazon very bad service.

"
"

  Total worth of money still with the enhanced gst rate by this financial year one must if thinking of buying a new phone and to boycott chinese phones, this is the phone you must look to. Superb battery backup, smooth functioning. Best part is Samsung care called me to ask if I was having any issue to which I told them and immediately within one day they rolled out a update for me and the issue got resolved. That's what Samsung is for you. To talk about camera, it's like you will get a glimpse of Samsung high end phones in this range. Best part is its video streaming view.

"

  I like battery back up but only disadvantage is fingerprint sensor not working properly .... remaining all goodCamera quality goodLess budget good qualityTill now used so many samsung phones out of all this is best compared with all qualities

  Samsung had improved lot after galaxy series. M21 is very good mobile in midrange, fast, large battery, decent look, and very much improved performance. After using galaxy duo in past hesitate to buy Samsung again, but when bought M21 satisfied with product performance.

"
"

  I have been using this device from past two months and must say, contrary to what people are reporting here, I haven't faced any kind of lag, battery drain, overheat, self reboot as such *lucky me* üòä.Display: sAMOLED üòòBattery backup: üí™üí™Camera: good, can get better with an update ü§ûUI: ü§òCompared to snoopy chinese UI, one UI is more polished, well optimized and less nosy as well. I recommend Samsung M21 for anyone with strict budget of 16k, who is looking for a smartphone which is non-chinese, has great brand value, offer good after sale service; GO FOR IT.PS: For gaming & photography enthusiasts, Do keep in mind that this smartphone cannot replace a gaming console or a DSLR.

  Phone is not working quite well.. ofcourse it has good camera quality, battery life but there is some technical issues..phone speaker are not working properly always interrupting and it always said that phone is switched off...Don't buy..

  Overall for 15k this phone is worth it (6gb ram variant), #DISPLAY: you WILL not find a better display at this price. #PERFORMANCE : (pubg wise), if you turn off optimisation and limit background processes to 1 at max(developer option), you get almost 3-4 hrs lag free 45-50fps gaming easily. #CAMERA : I feel the processor works too hard for camera quality (software wise) to compensate the low quality camera module (hardware).#BATTERY : awesome no doubt. #FINGERPRINT : way faster than in-display FR of upper mid spec phones. #ADVICE: Do not go for 4gb variant, 2 more gigs of ram (lpddr5) makes a lot of difference. #LOOKS: does it really matter? You're going to end up putting a cover on it anyways. Though, Its Ugly TBH.üòÖ and the phone is heavy like REALLY heavy. For me atleast!

"
"

  I bought this phone under a discount of Rs.1399/-  with no cost EMI by ICICI bank for six months. In this budget phone is fine and the other features are fantastic. Amazone offering good discounts compared to other online platforms.Fast charger in this budget can also be inbuilt like other phones are giving. It takes more than 3hrs for the full charge.For Games its perfect phone.

  I don't know it's amazon mistake or samsung they mentioned 15w fast charger but I got 10w charger in the box . Very disappointing.  It took almost 4 hrs to full charge. Camera quality is not upto the mark. It doesn't seem like 48 MP at all. Even my last mobile's 13 MP camera had better detailing than this 48 MP. And I would like to mention again that instead of 15w charger I got 10w charger  so be aware .

  Thanks to Amazon for delivering the Phone on time amidst the nation wide Lockdown.Samsung has done brilliant job with Galaxy M21 smartphone from its Galaxy M series.4GB RAM powered with Octa Core Processor gives good fast performance of Applications and Games.Camera quality is great compared to all its competitors in this price range. Color reproduction of image and detailing are nice. Night Mode performance of Camera is good if not the best to capture photographs in lo light.Super Amoled displays gives amazing screen viewing experience.At this price range and the quality Samsung Galaxy M21 provides is definitely superior compared to its competitors.Its makes Samsung Galaxy M21 absolutely a Best Buy !

  Don't believe samsung and amazon advertisers,the battery come only one day,even it is 6000 MAH,battery management is not nice,better to buy better brands in these price range,signal catching is weak,call dropping is more when I call to amazon customer care

"
"

  This is phone is having issues with signal reception, even in the city areas failed to get the signal, camera quality is very bad, getting pictures like cheap app filters. My 4 years old phone camera is as good as real then this idiotic samsung camera.I think we paid 14000 only for battery and display.Do not waste your money on this dump phone.Worst phone i ever seen.

"
"

  Trust me it is really awesome phone.First when i wanted a new phone i searched many of the phones and couldn't come to a conclusion.But the features of samsungM21 made me take the phone.It has all the features.The camera is damn awesome.And battery is really good it stays for long time.clarity is everything here.really really good .I am satisfiedto my heart.worth purchasing.üòÉüòÉ

  Lot of heating. can't talk for more than 5 min as the ear starts burning. very poor camera both front and back. clearly the lenses are not of great quality. camera resolution no where near 64 mp. no zoom in selfie camera. user interface not great. lots of bloatware. no gesture controls. can add only 3 fingerprints. cant take photos by touching anywhere on the screen, only on the clicking button which makes this pretty restrictive. screen ratio not good for official work, need to check the battery after few days, processor is good and fast, touch screen is very responsive with good feedback.....looking at the cons it is definitely not a good buy for me.

"
"

  It is a good budget phone but you can easily get better phone in this price range. Redmi ,realme is now providing better phone in 14000rs .ProsCamera quality is awesome.SAMOLED display you get in this device.6000 mah battery.ConsYou can face heating issue during normal uses.You only get 15 watt charging support in this phone which take 3 hours for full charging.Battery life is not very much.Finger print sencer is ok ok not to quick.Processer is also not powerful.Guys like this review.

"
"

  It has a network reception problem, probably in all models, because everyone in Samsung Members is posting about it.I too am facing same issue with my Jio sim. I tried all solutions suggested in that group, like switching to LTE/3g option, restarting etc software update, but nothing works.Seems like a hardware/software defect.Would suggest people to not buy till Samsung corrects this issue.Apart from that it's face scan is too slow. Rest of the specs are very good for this cost but without network this phone is of no use.

  1st amazon delivered early so thank you2nd the site did not show accurate site of package(do not rely on it)3rd great condition of package and great cooperation by delivery personRegarding productProsGreat battery lifeGreat screenGreat security featuresLooks goodConsPathetic charge time of 2 hours and more.Very very shoet charger wire i mean really smalllll.Touch sensor does not lock phone it can only unlock itBuilt quality is not sturdy.No headphones givenNo case givenCannot compete with motorola in terms of customisations and ease of use

  Hi I have taken this product may 31st and had a problem with charging on June 21st.So I have given to the Samsung customer care for the resolution.But initially they have confirmed problem with charger pin but even replacement of new charger pin also it is not working.So its issue with main mother board and it was a new product.I have sincere advice don't buy this Samsung m21 mobile worest mobile and am very unsatisfied with Amazon online and Samsung people.I have fighted with replacement of new mobile but they were saying with in 14days period only they can replaced.i got problem for 22nd days. Simple worest mobile don't take

"
"

  My take on purchasing online products is negative.From last few purchases whatever products i have bought were damaged or bad quality.Good thing is Amazon has a good return policy on selected products i think and the refund is also processed immediately.If you have patience to buy the product and if it turns out to become faulty and can waste the time then can try buying online from any online portal or else buy from SHOPS.

"
"

  Just as I expected, a true beast,let your smartphone adapt a battery drain once (use it until it gets 0%)and then , I am damn sure ,I will not have any complaints anymore.Processor is excellent as well,camera is mind blowing,tho face unlock could be better ,but fingerprint reader covers the absence and the Samoled screen takes me to a next world of virtuality.Thnx SamsungThnx amazon

"
"

  After using the phone for couple of weeks I'm writing this review. Oh man! the battery;the best.Its like using 2 powebanks with your phone.I'm fully satisfied with my battery.With that budget also its battery can compared with the premium flagship models of other brands.The performance of the phone is also very good.I'm very much satisfied.Camera looks brilliant.Video recording also has it standards with good stabilization.Last but not the least the display! the sAMOLED display-the best I have seen in my life.The best option for students who learning through online and a perfect one for watching movies through OTT.You can watch the contents in Dolby Atmos as well.Totally the phone provided more than what I expected.SAMSUNG‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Best phone in this 13K price segment.Exynos 9611 is ok when comes to gaming but if you want to play heavy title games i feels but if heat..You need to notice that even m31s comes with same processor .Top notch its display and  OneUI for fluidness.For now I am getting monthly security patch updates regularly. Battery life will take you straight two days when you are medium user and its powered with 6000mah.Samsungs as its own ecosystem so you can connect with any samsung tv or devices just with clickIf you are casual gamer and browser just blindly go for this instead waiting for chinese assemblers.Don't compare the processors  alone because those product has lot of ads and privacy issues

"

  I have been using this mobile phone for about a month. It has an amazing battery backup and camera as you all know that Samsung has a massive influence of it's camera quality.Ratings after using for a month:Mobile front desing: 4/5Back design: 3/5Camera: 4.2/5Battery Backup: 5/5Game performances: 3.5/5Overall: 4.5/5They have used a simple plastic on the back side of mobile phone. So it's look a little dull beacuse easily it could get scratched.Though if we compare other Samsung A series mobile phones or even M series like Samsung M20, Samsung M31 then I would suggest that please go for this one as it cost less and is almost same.

"
"

  Using one month after review this mobile good but I am face with some issues finger print reader is some time not work perfectly.Camera is good.Display: amazing display but sometimes but display brightness is automatically changed in auto brightness was off.Performance: neutral performance .Battery: good battery back up but some times battery train include always on display is off.Battery life one time battery is full battery life in 8 hours.Charching speed very slow.Battery is good really impressed.Value for money.

"
"

  This device is amazing on the task of multimedia works & also made in India.And gaming experience is good even but not excellent I would sayI bought 6, 128 variant and it was satisfactory for my usage as I am a student.So basically I do multitasking on it by split screen mode, pop up view mode and etc and I use about 5-6 apps at a time and the device works flawlessly. Just while playing pubg or higher end games, I require to clean my Ram and then I am able to play it on 35-50 fps and also the network is stableLoved the camera, just remember to change settings to 3:4-48 mp to get best settings.Finally it's great but obviously not as great as M31s üòÑ‚úåÔ∏è.#monstershot

  Samsung just known for reliability has done quite gud exp. This time with m series ....The phone is gud ....gud battery life ...nice user interface ...gud storage ....a fine refresh rate ...a high responding fingerprint scanner ....But if you are thinking that on 48 mp in samsung youbare gonna have a phone with a very gud camera like a dslr ...then you have to settle in pretty low condition because camera is not as that much very intensifying but it is gud ....front camera is gud .Overall this handset is perfect if your are going for a headset which is durable can work for 2-3 years ...yes it will...I  will rate it 4.5/5 ..

"
"

  the mobile is same what it has been shown but camera quality is far too less.. finger print sensor sometimes take to unlock the mobile. the video quality is also not that much high compared to vivo because both displays are almod displays only.i expected earphones attached to the box because the cost is high, but there isn't. further we have to buy earphones which is another money  thing.i also expected screen card but it is aslo not given, shame on samsungbaterry consumption is good. 80% charge gives one day all use( internet, music, streaming).the back panel is plastic , one have to put case or pouch to avoid damage by slipping.

"
"

  The packing is very good. The product was received in good condition. The delivery was also super fast even in this lockdown period. There are various options in camera. There are many videos in YouTube. We can watch those videos and can use these options. It takes nearly 1.45 hours to 2 hours to charge from 10 to 100. For moderate use it stands for 2 days. The fingerprint reader takes some more time to recognize. The mobile doesn't get heated by using. Overall for this price range this is a wonderful mobile. The only problem is the processing speed is little slow compared to other mobiles in this range. If you want to buy a mobile which is budget friendly and not a Chinese made mobile, this is a wonderful mobile to buy

"
"

  This is my first Samsung mobile and I was a bit cautious while ordering it. But to my delight, everything i.e build quality, camera, battery seems to be just awesome. I have been using this mobile from last 15 days and have an amazing experience so far. Battery is something that distinguishes it from others and with an average use, my battery Lasts for 3 days. Moreover, it is manufactured in India.

"
"

  I have bought this mobile after I had a lot of things in mind whether to go for other brands and Since i am loyal user of galaxy S series I had a faith in and bought.to be honest the phone was amazing. The main thing which excells are battery and display. I always loves display clarity in Samsung Phone they are best in class.Performance was awesome with the way it handles large application and multitaskingCamera was very good with 48 mp.  If you are looking for a phone with best features in terms of Camera,battery and performance go for it without any hesitation

"
"

  Guys, go for it if within your budget. I ordered it for my father and absolutely no complaint so far!Pros:Great camera quality and featuressmooth touch operation.Non-slippery back cover.Descent battery life ( tested with no facebook app so far)Works smoothly for basic operations.Cons:None so far but will update if find any in near future.

  I brought M21 6Gb version couple of months ago. Its really worth to buy. As per my personal use, its an excellent mobile in mid-range segment. Positive side of mobile is its Display and Battery. You will not get better display than M21 in any other mobiles at same price. Its outstanding battery life made it more interesting gadget to use. I recommended it to my friends and they have been using it since few days and they are happy with purchase.  Unfortunately few days ago my mobile got damaged because of accident. So sad to loose new mobile. So if you plan to buy it(any smart mobile for that matter) I suggest you to buy protective gear along with it.  Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend it.

"
"

  I watched so many vedios and chose this phone because of its battery and display...... display was great but I am very disappointed with Samsung.... this time almost everybody in my house uses Samsung but I am disappointed with its battery....... my sister uses Redmi Note 8 pro with 4500mAh battery....... even she got better battery than my 6000mAh....... I regret to buy this phone bcoz my top priority is its battery....... really very disappointed ........ I read review and i thought some of them are writing false review but i experience the same....... so don't buy it if u want a good battery backup.....

"
"

  This phone is awesome worth buying at Rs13900... Full value for money No regret at allGood battery lifeAll features as mentionedAnd as usual it justice with barnd name samsungAm writing this review after 2 days receiving this phone what goes ahead will intimate on review after further useRt now its awesome feeling wonderful thanks samsung thanks amazon

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor in not working fast. Takes 2-3 seconds time. Front camera average. Rear camera good. Battery life good. Build quality is poor. Manufactured and Made in India.

"
"

  A nice decent phone. Camera is good but does not have those funny timepass mimics. You can download those if you want.Get a hot while charging so you can't use it just by plugging out to take a call.Body is very average. You need a nice designer wear for its body.For professionals its best budget phone as they do not need a phone not a supercomputer.Be ready for occasional hangup.

  Hello I have bought this Galaxy M21 now. this is a very good phone this is a Monster and it has a very good quality camera it has also large battery and when you take it in your hand it looks very slim despite it has a large  battery I love this phone it's selfie camera is also very good it has a super amoled display which makes it a perfect budget phone I would like to say that I tried both the phones this phone as well as the redmi note 9 Pro but I liked this phone because of its super amoled display and of its large battery as well as of its great camera and its quality is very good thanks I would prefer you to buy this phone hope you would like this review and I would like to say that it's what monster thanks

"
"

  Display and Camera perfomences are amazing for this  th rate.Any how the finger print feed back is a little slow compared to other phones of the same range.The phone provides you with some exclusive features.Power management is quite significant,it gives you with continues gaming for about 10 hr.It also provide a game booster service.For best experience of the specifications i prefer 6gb 128gb model.

"
"

  Overall nice phone at a budget price memory is awesome little disappointed with battery though it is 6000 mh but with limited use it last only for 2 days withone sim active  it could be because of screen size ..it's more of nitpicking .. overall satisfied for the value of money

"
"

  I've  bought samsung galaxy m21 . Its superfine and its display is awesome punchy colours and ok inky blacks . Its camera quality is more than enough for this range. The battery life of this phone really great . Once i charge it up to 100 percent it can be used for 2 or 2 and half days.fingerprint reader is pretty fast,face unlock is also fast. Many youtubers says that this phone can run moderate games very well and when we play at high graphics it will not able to, but that's  not right when j play at intensive graphics setting it manages it . Over all it is a good suggestion to buy those who are expecting all day battery , best display in this segment or good camera can buy this . So, my rating is 5 out of 5 .

"
"

  I bought the 6+128GB variantPro's:Display - Sharp and VibrantOS - Very well optimisedCamera - GoodBattery Life - PhenomenalPerformance - Very well optimised for day to day usage, it can run PUBG mobile at Smooth+Extreme without any noticable lag, it supports upto HDR+Ultra settingsCons:Heats up while playing for long time,Speaker Quality could be improvedIt is a overall nice product, i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy a phone around 15k. Buy the 6GB Ram variant, those extra Ram keeps the phone lot smoother!!

"
"

  Overall a good mobile. Facelock doesnt work properly. Battery and screen are major plus points and cemera is above average. Could have been better if image processing output would be more realistic. Big specs Ram/Rom.Rest is fine. Looking for some solutions regarding face inlock.Thanks

"
"

  I am writting this review after 2 months of use..Cons:Touch sensor is not up to mark..just average,Screen is very prone to damage...even if u put phone inside ur tight pocket, it can be damaged..Speaker can be a bit loudYear phone/back cover must be thereProcessor must be atleast 730 GPros:Screen brightness and color reproduction is good because of sAmoledBattery life is most satisfying for me bacause my phone is always onBest weight balance at this price that too with 6000 mAhConclusion:U can go for it if u wanna a phone for 1 year. Beyond that it became slow down.

"
"

  Phone is Good for normal use. Finger print sensor is ok......not so fast. The only thing i don`t like in this mobile is light calibration of the  screen. It uses camera as a brightness sensor which is very disgusting......... i have to change the brightness manually all the time....specially when i go out. The second thing is the build quality. My phone gets scratched just one day of use. so be careful .Rest phone is good, no issue regarding performance and screen quality.

"

  Os Is the Best ONEUI >MIUI(Adds),> Realme os(Copy of Both UI)HardwareThe Battery is a dam better than Xiaomi and real meAmoled Its not there any smartphone @ this rangeNo Adds ManWell Optimized OSThe only one comprised that Samsung silicon  9611If you are not a heavy gamer This perfect MobileJust Go for itTry it once and Come out from Chinese brandsExpect that everything is fine

"
"

  Worth buying  it even at 14000. Loving it's user interface.  Amoled screen  gives you premium  feel. If you are a camera person then it's not that great  for you. For normal person camera is ok. 7 to 8 hr battery  backup for normal use like browsing  and streaming. Did not face any network  or other problem till now.

"
"

  Excellent quality.. better than any other china product. Go for it.. you dont repent üëçüëçPros.. Longlasting battery, very good camera, very fast finger censor, the amoled display is awesome, verygood processor and so on.Cons.. Nothing to mention

"

  i have bought this phone for my father because he wanted a phone with no bloatware , no ad's and a non chinese phone as samsung is a korean brand there's no problem at all and the samsung's UI is also good very simple but also comes with a lot of features. till today my father have not faced any issues reagarding the phone its samsung galaxy m21 (6Gb ram, 128 Storage) i will recommend you this version only because for a future safe phone because nowadays the app sizes are increasing and system apps takes alot of storage appprox 10gb so buy a minimum of 6GB varient. overall for day to day usage this is a great phone you can buy it. THANK YOU

"
"

  This phone stands on its claims. I bought Samsung M21 4gb 64gb variant. I haven't find any problem till now. I have been using this as my primary mobile since May, 2020.The fingerprint reader is smooth as butter. It responses very quick.The camera comes with an amazing quality, and the zoom in capacity is also good. The storage quality is also good. You will not regret clicking photos from this device. Its camera also supports making timelapses, slowmotion and super slow motion.Battery is 6k mAh. Such a strong battery in a low price to range is very rare. And the type C charging port makes your life easy.

"
"

  It's a decent and balanced phone in terms of performance as well as camera quality.Some pretty good samsung specific hidden features:Samsung adaptible soundCustomisable gestures for ease of useAccurate colour reproduction in imagesWith wideline L1 and HDR 10+ certifications, HD content can be streamed on OTT platformsApart from this... many developers such as microsoft and adobe have crafted apps specially designed for Samsung which improves the performance while using apps such as Office or Lightroom.Manual mode of camera doesn't have any manual controls which is a downside if you are into pro photography. Rest it's a great phone in the price range.

  Nice phone..nice look..1.Battery backup is excellent.2.

  Samsung galaxy M21 is the best phone in 16k(6Gb ram,128rom varient) price range.Camera is brilliant compared to other phone in this price range.Samsung One Ui 2.0 is undoubtedly one of best ui for smooth Internet surfing and gaming. Sound quality is ok.No heating issue. Some garbage apps like helo pre installed but you can uninstall it.Fingeerprint sensor is extreme fast.And last of all you get a huge 6000mah battery.Excellent battery backup is the main advantage of this phone. Easily it can run for 1-2days without charging.If you want great specifications in a mid-ranged phone, without any second thought just go for it.üëç

"
"

  M21 is good phone but camera and processing speed is just average big battery gives 4-5 days standby in mid usage,charging is very good fast charging work well but in 48 mp camera the quality is not alike 48 mp camera its gives image stabilization which is good but camera not give the quality which is our expectation from Samsung.

"
"

  Mobile LCD be came defective within 45 days.  Samsung service did not convey  that it could not be repaired and after waiting 30 days when I blasted on them then they replaced it with another high value mobile where I had to spend another Rs. 6000 for the mobile. Pathetic way of generating new additional business.

"
"

  It is a nice phone..battery good.No screen guard required i m using since last 2 month without screen card no issue if scratch. Speed id too fast. Camara is also good.For a normal daily routine it us best fit for both pocket and daily essencials.Without worry take it

"
"

  Great product in this budget range. I used this phone from past 6 days. I'm a moderate user.Battery  life : 1 day 6 hrs  ,  but  charging speed is petty slow for this monster battery.Charging time: 2 hrs 25 mins (0 to 100%) approxCamera: image processing is suprising in this budget range.Fingerprint scanner: it's not quick enough because of it's animation.  And for accuracy,  I'll give 3 star out of 5.For day to day life , it's a good with Samsung branding.

"
"

  Disappointing. Please look at other options.Battery : lasts long. Takes time to charge but if you reduce brightness, charges very fast.Performance: some apps lag. Keyboard gets stuck sometimes.Sound : GoodCamera : Most disappointing. Bought the phone looking at camera specs and reviews but nothing in it. Pic quality is poor. No options in camera app.There is no home button. Navigation bars are on screen. Too bad. You need to use side button to switch on and off. The side button is very weak and like my previous samsung phone, it could break easily. Even in my previous 5k phone there was home button and navigation buttons on phone body rather than on screen.

"
"

  Overall good phone. No difference in performance for 6GB and 4 GB ramUpdate after one month of use is as below1. Display of the phone is really amazing2.  battery backup is also greatCons -1.  operating system and some application keep hanging over again and again2.  camera is not really impressive when you are taking slow motion shot in non natural light the video output keeps flickering which is very bad experience

"
"

  Camera- best camera under 15k ready to post in Instagram without any editingDisplay- best display, comparable with phones of price 25k no other phone can give you this display under 20kBattery- 6000mah is really very very hugePerformance- if u areva non-gamer buy it without any hesitation, ram management is best and if u are a gamer u can do decent gaming but my suggestion is go with any other phone that is specifically made for gamingUi- my personal best part of this phone vis its user interface which is far far better than that of other Chinese brands and also there are no blotware and banned Chinese apps

"
"

  Don't buy this phone because I purchased this phone on dated 20/07/2020 , 10 days after it stopped taking mobile charging why.. I took the mobile after so many days, considering it good and if it happens, how will it feel .Amazon gave these mobile deliveries on 20/07/2020 and closed the policy on 27/07/2020, now what should I do? Please help me I want this mobile replacement please. Help

"
"

  After using it. Nearly for 3 months  it developed a multicolour bubble near right corner of the screen. It started spreading and by 8 hours  it spread so much i cannot read any text or. Number properly. I went to Samsung customer service center . They said I have to pay for its repair which they estimated as Rs5500. This inspire of my showing Amazon purchase voucher and Sa Acko protection plan. Cm you do some thing.

"
"

  Nice phone.Display (10/10)Battery (10/10)Camera is above average especially day time (7.5 out of 10) night time (5/10)Performance is also good (8/10)Overall (8/10)Touch, WiFi and everything works perfect.No complaints till now.And yes don't forget to purchase back cover to avoid scratches.

"
"

  Thanks to amazon for one day before deliveryAnd coming to the phone it's a 6gb and 128 gb variant which is pretty good but back panel of the phone at it's end shown lite scratches after it's unboxing.Black color looks very good and camera front quality is good,48mp cam is not worthy but good.Display is very good,But I truly dissatisfied about the battery of the phone it's working is like 4500mah battery,I expected a lot from 6000mah battery. No hanging problem was found in it and also I am not a gamer for making the Ram suffer üòâIt is a family oriented mobile perfectly suits for home usage or women usage.

"
"

  I was experience in 6 months samsung galaxy m21 waste mobile in the world.Because it's hanging and auto switch off mobile,Strach the logo of Samsung infront switch on the mobile.

"
"

  Only couple of problems that I have with this phone.1 they don't provide any cover, so your phone is vulnerable to scratches.2 they also does not provide any screen guard, again your phone is vulnerable to scratches.Other than this the phone is of good quality. I didn't buy this phone for gaming purpose, but I played pubg (just to check) and despite of 4GB ram it is working great, even at HDR mode.I bought this phone for my mom because of samsung name and it's UI, and it's UI is best, no non sense add will popup on your screen all the time.Overall a great phone. Camera need an update (update in terms of software).

"
"

  I have been using iphone till date and as usual again the battery issue occurred and it was a pain to carry a phone with no use. I finally decided to buy the samsung m21 and as the tagline says, it is really a MONSTER. Its tye best budget smartphone you can ever have with a power packed battery with 6000mah which lasts 2 days easily. Performance has not disappointed me and not to forget the super amoled display, wow! makes your display even better and makes you want more and more with a 6.4"" screen. I would definitely recommend you to go with samsung m21. You will love using this phone, trust me.Kudos to samsung for the great initiative for the smarphone world, they never let down.

"
"

  After doing an intensive research around my budget finally decided to go for M21.First impression were super. It looked classy and neat camera bump at the back is flattened out precisely.(As there have been lots of talk about its aesthetics to other phones in this price segments)Display is just perfect for media consumption best in class and its budget.UI is optimized perfectly although there are lots of pre installed apps which you can uninstall as per convenience.Samsung is doing a great job in budget phones.*Highly recommended*

"
"

  I am writing this review after using phone for last 3 days. I am a heavy phone user that's why I opte for 6000mh battery and is quite good, back up of the phone is very good and last for a day. Fingerprint reader is quite good Compared to other phones like honor which I was using earlier. I am not found of photos but camera quality is very good. Display is very good all colours reflecte like they are real. touch is very smooth. With lots of apps and multi tasking phone dint hang till date. Really a good phone at this price range that to made in India.

"
"

  ¬†1. This is product is best under 15K and recommender for day to day usage.2. Screen Resolutions are best.3. Camera optimisation, Image Processing, Auto Scene Selection are best and Samsung cameras are unbeatable from the starting. Selfie Camera is a bit fuzzy but I think samsung will improve it in new updates.4. Battery was under performing first few days and takes more time to rechagre but after 4 or 5 of recharge cycles. Now battery performance is unbeatable and rechages fastly.Gaming Performance is best for normal gamers but sometimes it lags.No heating Problem after high usage.

"
"

  This is the best budget phone under 15K with mega battery which can give 1.5 day battery life on single charge, camera front as well as back are good, the camera focus is nice and fast in video also. UI is just awesome and stable even in landscape mode. Software support is good (u will get software updates on time).And it is a NON CHINESE phone .....Best feature :its User Interface especially its screen split is just awesome and very much stable.....CONS:1). 2 hr 30 min charging time. ( could have given 18 watt or 30 watt charging capacity).2). Sometimes it heats up while charging ( so I recommend don't charge this phone for long period in single run)

  This budget phone has more features than expected . previously i was using redmi note 7 pro which has so many ads and consume so much metwork but in this phone it can't be seen . its a good product. moreover this smartphone has 1 year warranty (redmi also has 1 yr. warranty but everyone knows they always blame customer when something happens to phone). this phone has very good camera specially night mode camera is very amazing . this phone also has a monster battery of 6000mah which lasts up to 1.5 days easily.this phone also has s amoled display which increases its value and uniqueness .So i would say it is the best phone under 15000rs budget .I will rate it 4.6stars out of 5 stars.

  I m reviewing after 10 days of usage , Purchased by Amazon 16000/- , what a nice, superb ph at this range , this is my 5th smartphone , but the best smartphones ever, average usage of 2 days battery is 25% , I m playing CODM with high graphics settings but without any lag , but some heating issue , camera quality is benchmarked only day light , but at night , camera quality is not at the benchmark. Overall m21 is highly recommended for heavy rough usage . ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©

  Best about Samsung phones is peace of mind and dedinitely UI and with great processor it is optimized for most of the app.Security considerations also good as we are going digital mostly these days paying Bill's, purchasing, money transfer and other activities.I gifted this phone to my father and he is happy. With M21 he is smart phone user now at 74 yrs. So first time is always cherishing.I observed recently that camera quality is also great in video calling and picture quality.

"

  If you want a phone for media consumption. Then its the best you can get at this price. SAMOLED Screen paired with 6000Mah battery gives you best media consumption experience. Cameras are pretty good as well for price.Coming to peformance.. Its pretty good for most of daily usage. But if you want to game on this device..exyons processor is not for you. And not a good looking phone if you are looking for premium looks.

"
"

  The great points are 1. OLED display 2. Amazing camera module with depth camera and ultra-wide lens. 3. The battery life.A great phone for its price that also comes with a depth camera to take bokeh effect photos and ultra-wide photos. And this is the only phone that offers an OLED display in this price range compared to the other brands.

"
"

  Cons: charging time is high due to 15w charger. Samsung has improved in in m31s with 25wFront camera is great but rear one is not meeting expectationSmall Features like hide battery icons, alarm ring time less than a minutes  etc. are missing.sometime it matters.Built material is too weak so don't  use without rugged back cover otherwise it may broke easilyPros: battery back up unquestionableSound quality  perfectTouch and fingerprint  premium qualityUI is also good.Pros:

"
"

  This is a Nice phone. First of all it's worth the money. Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow. Screen refresh rate also a bit slow. Both Cameras are good. There are a lot of pre-loaded good filters are there. The worst thing is the pre-loaded apps...which is disgusting!!! A bit hard to use and carry the phone...because of its length...can't use it with one hand. Budget phone. All-in-all it's a Classy Phone

"
"

  This phones isn't made for heavy or multi tasking.Its upper portion will start heating up once it power ons and continues to heat up and becomes much hot.You can choose this phone if you want to use it as a calling phone and having less apps.But if you are buying for gaming or heavy tasking then don't buy this phone you won't be able to touch this phone after using just fr about 15 mins(heavily).

"
"

  Review here after using 7days Continuously as i can.I never given review of any mobile because experience was not great as i expect but this time i can't stop without writing guys.All i wanted to say if you are looking for budget and good performance mobile then go for M21 because in this range you won't get this high quality performance mobile.Camera Quality Awesome.Working Smoothly.Display Quality great with sAmoled.And  you also get new features in this set.Battery performance Awesome.One of the my favorite Dolby audio support make Videos experience great.I have to say Samsung work hard on his product quality.

  Earlier at the time of purchase I read all positive and negative review.but after using samsung mobile I want clear all negative review are false based story.my  review is:_ its battery back up is full day . Camera is average.screen is good one light I missed at selfie camera.finger print is good. Overall I love my set.Thank you

"
"

  excellent mobile. bought it for 14k.bought it for parents.camera is super good.only downside is that phone is not Android one.it would be getting patches directly from Google if it were Android one but that okay considering its features.

"
"

  Got delivered it today for my Mom.Delivery was made well within 24 hrs with prime. It's a decent phone for low to moderate users but it's definitely not meant for heavy users. Sensors & apps are quite responsive & acceptable at this price range.Camera performance is at par but was expecting more than that bcoz it comes with a 48 megapixels camera tag. But if you are not a gamer or heavy sort of user then I think you can definitely go for it & specially if you dont want to opt for Chinese brands. I'll be posting another review after using it for a month & let you know about the overall performance of this device.Good luck!

  Samsung m21 review after first week of usagePros:Top notch displayLong lasting batteryGood camera qualitySamsung UI works really well and efficientlyFinger print sensor is quickPerformance is quite well ( for a highend non gamer)Much better than MI and realme under 13kCONS:screen to body ratio could been increased.Decent selfie camera15w charger takes almost 2 and half hours to charge fullOn screen finger print sensor missingFINAL VERDICT: pros weighs more than cons.So one can easily opt for m21 and as always SAMSUNG branding

"
"

  I am using this phone for a month, i would say good phone considering the price...excellent battery, nice back camera, good amoled screen which you should consider while buying a phone...but front camera is below average in artificial lighting.i am not more into gaming so cannot say much about it, but in regular uses no issue at all..overall good phone, because i too had MI phone, believe me after update MI phone camera became wrost..also you are not gonna get Chinese brand easily as most of the time they are out of stock..so if you are  looking for a phone under 15K and not a chinese brand...then Go for it without a Doubt...

  Camera - 5(48mp rear triple camera, 20 mp front)Display - 5(6.4 inches, sAMOLED, 420 nits, 403 ppi density)Battery life - 4.5 (6000 mah, 15 W charger takes about 3hrs to charge)Performance - 4( antutu score - 180k)Os - 4.5 ( android 10 with one Ui 2 and bloatware)Looks - 3.5( plastic body)Accessories - 2(15 W adapter with cable, no earphones)Value for money - 5(Better display, camera and battery as compared to other phones; not meant for heavy gaming, games like pubg are playable, but maxing out the graphics results in significant drop it in frame rate. Not to mention it has a 60hz display)

"
"

  i m writing this review after using 10 days of smartphone.Pros:- display is amazing, day light photography is amazing and if you are a moderate user then use can use this phone 1.5 days in singal charge.Cons:- Low light camerq is not good, charging speed is not good it take 3hrs from 0 to 100%""This smartphone is better then Chinese phones like realme and redmi and other if you are not a pro gamer "" you can play games like pubg but in balance settingsOne more thing sound quality is not good of this phone .

"
"

  So received the phone yesterday, pro and cons are as followingPros-1- 6000 rah massive battery support.2- Fast charging if go as per range.3- AMOLED display.4- 6/128 configuration in the range if 16k with 6000 mah battery.Cons-1- Design is bit boring.2- Charging cable is substandard.3- Phone is good for non-gaming person.So ill conclude its good to buy if one like to use phone for day to day needs not specific to gaming because it lags there. it best for me as I am a non-gaming person. 4/5 for the m21 6gb/128gm

  The phone is the best one I have ever used.I love  the tri cameras (48mp,8mp5mp) , I love the display(super amoled), I love the battery life span (6000mah), I love the charging speed(15watt fast charger) , I love all the security features(supre fast face unlock and finger print sensers) , I love the simplicity of design of this monster , I love the super cool features. It's midnight blue variant is adorable. In this price range (INR.12699) this mobile phone is the bestest one . Android version 10 is my dreame feature and this mobile satisfies my all the needs and requirements, and this faves me more and more than my wants . I really loved the super cool üëåüëåüëåüòçüëå‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüëåüòçüëåüëåüòé‚ù§Ô∏è üòé smartphone. That's all.

  Good phone in less priceVery compatible with m30, m31Only difference is camera.If not interested in camera then take m21.Awesome battery capacity (for gamers average)I took 128gb, 6gb ram phone for ‚Çπ16000.If looking for good looking phone not to choose samsung as back is plastic and matt.best for regular use phone callsWifi,mirroring,every app and displaybis smiled awsomeNot best but better for PUBGIf taking 128 gb or 64 gb with 6 or 8 gb ram only.It will work 24 hours for whatsapp and phone calls etc if not playing PUBG for long... HpursCould be good

"
"

  Large display with long life battery.No heating issues but slighty get warm while charging & when i do screen mirroring with TV.Took 3 hrs for charging if ur battery is less than 20% but then no need to charge for 2 days. If u r moderate user.Less ads as compared with MI, oppo or other brands.Writing this after one month of usage.

"
"

  After a use of 1 month, shifting from redmi to samsung feels not good, samsung interface and camera is not good, there is no remote facility to access TV, AC, etc.A simple piece of infinix, realme, techno can also beat this pieceNot loving this piece

  M21 has some built quality issue.1. Screen brightness auto mode responds after few seconds. Sometime it takes  upto 10 seconds to increase brightness when moving from dark room to light room.2. Screen auto rotation function sometimes does not work and need to rotate screen manually.3. During video call (through any app like, Whatsapp, duo or through jio), if we get a voice call in between video call, sound from other side will be not audible after completing voice call. Voice do not increase even with side voice button. We must cut video call and then need to try again.Aamir

"
"

  Overall good phone for my mom.. easy to use & handleOne issue is that the back panel is slippery. Necessary to have a good cover and tempered glassRear camera is good and front camera could be better..I cudnt find potrait mode in this phone.. maybe I need to explore the features in coming days

"
"

  This product is very nice and a budget friendly. I would like to share some likes and dislikes about the the product as follows:Likes:-(1) Camara quality is excellent(2) Battery is very powerful, once charged you can easily use it for more than one day, even if uh are heavily use it.(3) Super AMOLED screen provides brilliant experience of everything, colors look natural and cool for eyes.(4) Fingerprint reader is very quick and accurate(4) Very easy to operate and user friendlyDislikes:-(1) Charging time is little high, but can be avoided due to its huge Battery life.

"
"

  Just fo for this one you won't Regret it, This phone is amazing the Display is the best, you won't find any other display like this, the camera quality is amazing like the 48MP sensor click some amazing photo loved it, battery life is mind blowing, the battery is monster totally nailed it the 6000Mah is super good, the fingerprint reader is very fast loved it, You get always on display plus this is not a Chinese brand so you have all the security and privacy.

"
"

  Awesome phone definitely go for it if your looking for a budget phone.. im writting this review after a months use..... im gaming and watching videos all day with my data turned on and still it gives me a full 24hrs battery leaving behind atleast 20% when I'm charging next day morning.Only the smudges comes to a problem... other then that i love what it has

"
"

  If you are the person looking for the best display quality and battery life and unless you are not a gamer then i willl highly recommend this MONSTER..This is one of the best budget phone ever i seen ....I research a lot before buying this phone (2 to 4 month of research)i compare lots of phone brand ..AND my research comes to end with this MONSTER ü§©ü§©3 MONTH COMPLETED with this phoneeAnd i am satisfied with the best product that Samsung gave me ...Thank u Samsung...and ur talented employees ü§©ü§©Camera quality is so good..Body is also so slim and looks great

"

  Hi,I buy this fantastic looking phone and I pretend it to be the good phone which only having addon feature of huge battery life and think that other features inside the box is satisfactory.But on other side when it comes in my palm (today- since 01 week use). It is just one big box of wonder. Having 64 mp camera with slow motion also super slow motion fantastic feature it is to me. Also 2 days + 01 night Huge battery backup,  and super amoled display with widevine video support which is bunch of surprises.Fingerprint is truly fast than other premium phones I used before.ThanksSamsung M21

"
"

  Iam Totally satisfied with this phone . Flagship Experience , Long Lasting battery , sAMOLED No Question Ultimate experience , Camara Next Level , Hyper Boost Perfomance , Smooth Response - The SAMSUNG M21 ( All Avangers in one Pack)

"
"

  Good mobile.Heats during charging, which is normal for 6000maH battery.Camera heats during shooting. This is also seen in other mobiles, therefore, considered normal.Flickers in slow motion indoor videos but NOT IN NATURAL SUNLIGHT.

  Samsung is the known world best-selling brand because Samsung perform great everything üëå  finger prints reading fast 0.4 sec and display, legend look, signal strength is good u can also compare to any other brand phones battery life 2 days you can use any kind of work  it's  great. This my review after use nearly 6 years journey with Samsung  heart full thanks to Samsung because my area signal strength is very poor after change my mobile phone into Samsung my problem was solved.

"
"

  I do no recommend this phone.... many apps are not working properly and hanging if you use multiple apps simultaneously.... performance is too worst and Amazon support is worst.... before buying you can see many specialities options but after buying phone you will not get proper support and they won't accept return... I recommend not to buy any products in Amazon because they won't support after purchases... 15days replacement is just trap here... I have call recordings and not getting  an option to return as well... I have screen shots too and I'm going put consumer case on this same if I didn't get my money back.

"
"

  This mobile is honestly, a good deal for a budget phone. Nice battery life and decent quick charging. Battery life could easily last a day. Rear camera is excellent. The front camera, although good, could be a bit better. Fingerprint sensor and the face unlock are really good, better than most budget phones. The display is good and feels snappy. Overall, the product is excellent for casual use.The only cons I have faced is the weight and the speakers. It feels a little bit heavy. Arms would get tired after a while. And there one a single speaker in the phone, located at the bottom. It feels a little basic.Probably the best product in this price tag.

"
"

  Pros- superb display clearity- never gets hang- never got heated till now- somany gesture features you must check it- somany accessibility features you must check it- somany camara features (your default camara will be 12MP)- ultimate video graphy- superb sound clearity & effects- popup notification (I fall in love with this feature)- you can use multiple application on same screenConts- You can not properly use playing music in device using bluetooth headphone while the mobile hotspot is on

"
"

  best phone at this price point.... i gifted this to my sister... and if you are not a heavy gamer... just go for it... because without gaming only display and camera would be your prioritity and no one can beat this phone in that department.takes 2.5 hrs to charge but once charges you can use it for 1.5 - 2 days regularlycamera is outstanding at this priceno lagging or hagging issuereliable name of samsung branddisplay is best in class everytime you press that power button display makes you feel good...just go for this one guys.....

"
"

  Don't waste your money. I have booked few days before, yesterday I received the device I have used only 18 hours. System not working properly can't able to access the apps.  Even not able to restart the device. Unable to attend the call. System hanging up frequently. Pls don't bye. When I spoke to customer care about the phone. Tec team not available in week end. They are available in week days only from 8 am to 1 pm. So for  next few days I can't able to do anything. As this is the freedom sale. If customers faces this kinds of issues.  Amazon have to take responsibility to solve this kind of issues immediately.

  Well we all know how Samsung products are first of all I am buying Samsung for the second time in my life it is my second phone to M21 is one of the finest Samsung phone I have ever used its camera quality is brilliantly nice I must appreciate its 48 megapixel camera and the processor oh my God it is too too too goodüëÄüòõAnd we all know how cool it is to use Samsung products I literally love it and I must ask everybody out there to go for itü§≠ if you are thinking to not to buy a Chinese product then Samsung is a must go and I guess in this price range it is the bestüí´I Love M21 In Every Manner‚ù§ü•∞

"
"

  Very good efficient  performance of installed apps including that of battery.However during my decades long usage of mobiles I was not at all using vibration option of notification. In this M21 os there is no provision  to stop vibration totally. So one has to accept these VIBRATION DISTURBANCES.

"
"

  Initially I thought I made a big mistake by buying this phone. 3rd party app like Twitter was just not working fine. But after a few days and lots of setting changes the phone is just working superb now.Its fast,  features are good and overall Samsung support experience is good. Camera is cool.

"
"

  I paid 14k for this phone and it didn't even work for 2 months properly. I thought samsung is a reliable company but this is the worst product I have ever seen. The screen got a black dot in it after 1 month of use and as days passed it kept on getting bigger and now the screen is completely blacked out and phone is no longer useful. I went to Samsung customer service near Vijayanagar, and they said that they don't cover warrenty for this phone even though there is 6 months warranty for the phone. This is the worst mobile phone I have ever come accross. Please look elsewhere if you don't wanna burn your money.

"
"

  Lets talk about this phone1. Its non-chinese and a great device2. Battery backup is really good3. Gaming and 9611 processoser is decent4. Speakers are good and loud5. Camera is ok in outdoors but indoor it really sucks6. Design and feel of this phone is goodOverall a good device and worthy subsitute for chinese phonePlease Don't buy chineseJai hind

I am not a gamer but this device can handle medium games also..battery- I am a heavy user and  I am getting a full day battery life with this.  I am satisfied..camera - it is good in day light and avg at nights , cant expect more at this price point...display - This is the best of all at this price point. best to watch content.call quality - good.speakers - avg.

"
"

  Basically I prefer a strong durable mobile as it has plastic body but I always prefer using back cover for bulkier look and safety. As I have experienced of using this a week  1-It is fast  2-it won't lag(it gives me up to 1.3 GB of free  primary memory)  3- Fingerprint  is quick  4- Face recognition  is some times slow  5-battery backup is good but charging takes time  up to 2.5-3 hrs  6- rear Camera quality is very good I don't  use  front camera a lot but the camera is good.  Basically  I can say it is an excellent buy ...thanks AMAZON

"
"

  I want to say that you can buy this definitely because it is one of the best non Chinese option in the market . It also has good camera and screen.It has a good processor also I am mentioning this because most of the people said that this is outdated processor but I want to say that this processor can run everything smooth even pubg in high setting.Thank you.

"
"

  After using more than one week I feel it very good. I have used custom rom powered phone previously so I feel a bit difficult using this phone but the performance is very nice. The one UI is cool but some times I have noticed lags/hangs in keyboard operation. Inbuilt VPN, spam caller option and other privacy options are fit for me. I feel happy if they provide screen recording and adedicated music player in upcoming updates. Fingerprint reader is fast enough, Bcoz of huge battery it took 18min operation of zoom meeting to come from 100% to 99% so I say it had a wonderful battery life and even it had inbuilt emoji creating option for which I have installed an app in my previous phone.

"
"

  I have bought this mobile phone on 22nd July and delivered to me on July 27.I see after just 1 month I have seen the charger is not recognizing and phone is not charging up. No sign of charging.I have checked with Amazon customer care for the replacement or resolution , they have told to check with Samsung care.This is unnecessary trouble to me, this is makes me feel that the phone handset which I have got is faulty one. Please read all the return or replacement policy docs once before buying. Hope this helps to another customer like me.

"
"

  Never expected this problem!Everything in this phone is up to the specifications but the internet speed sucks!Even checked it with other devices at my home but my wifi speed is completely fine which means the problem is in the phoneI have ordered a Samsung phone before but it was completely fine and the worst part is the exchange period has expired which was for a week and now I can do nothing, was deeply disappointed by samsung as I have never experienced such a problem.I didn't even knew that a problem like this existed in phones before this

"
"

  The main cons in this mobile are:-1.Its processor...Its just not for gaming...but good for all our daily day uses..its not a big negative for normal users2.If they have given a 25w charger then it is a killer mobile in this price range...with 15w charger it is taking nearly 2:45mins to charge fullyPros:- cameraBlockbuster battery coming nearly more than a dayExcellent displayCool FingerprintGood UI easy to useBixby camera is excellentAnd everything is good and working fine

"
"

  Product is fine, but the box of the product was torn from one of it's edges and was tapped. Didn't notice this on the first day just focused on the seal and kept the box for isolation. Now after 5 days I took a look on the box properly then noticed the damage. This was done after the company packaging and before the dealer put their tag.Although have no complaints with the product, but yeah the virtual light sensor that uses camera is totally awful and doesn't works properly, Samsung should focus on it and give a proper light sensor or improve the virtual sensor's performance by software updates.

"
"

  I hvae used for 2 months ,nie the mobile starts hanging and restart automatically,i do not sat every mobile is like this ,but think a while before closing this ,i have given at service center ,they have reloaded software ,but no use ,later given to them again for observation for 3 days ,dont know what will happen

"
"

  after using it now for 2 weeks here are the pros and cons i found:pros:1)Very Good battery life.2)sAMOLED Display at this price range.3)both back and front cameras quality is very good.4)super steady video mode is awesome as it make the vedio very much stable.cons:1)charging time is very slow as it takes around 3 hrs or more to get fully charged.2)phone get highly heated during its charging time.3)not good for long smooth gaming performance.conclusion: Overall its a very good smartphone for those who loves to consume media  more than gaming.But it will not be preferable for those whose priority for gaming is more.

"
"

  I read the reviews and still went ahead with my order trusting the brand but the phone‚Äôs screen went off within 13 days of purchase now we will have to sort it at the service centre since ten days return is also lapsed..its a beautiful phone but wont last.

"
"

  This is one of the best mid range phone.The best thing about this phone is its monster battery, you can use it for one day playing games watching movies.Camera quality is excellent apart from macro photography.And processor is also good but not meant for heavy gamers. For me it's good as I am not a heavy gamer.And one of the best thing about this phone is it's super amoled display, if you are fond of movies then you will fall in love with its display.Overall this is very good option in mid range phone..Battery life - 5/5Camera - 4.5/5Processor- 3.5/5Display - 5/5Overall - 4.5/5

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is not that fast and also and phone getting charged is very slow.I feel back camera quality is awesome but front cam not that great like RedMi.Moreover battery is not drained fast and phone is also not heating up too early.The best feature of the phone I liked is even if the screen is locked you can get all the latest updates and play videos as well.Only charging phone is a issue for me. If you are keeping your phone on charge at night time then there won't be any issue.All over good phone to buy at reasonable price.

"
"

  I am in love with this Samsung Galaxy m21 smart phone which is actually quite smart than its other competitors(phone)in today's timeBattery life is awesome it get  charged very quickly and long lastingCamera quality is superb very clear and fine pic we get by thisFingerprint reader is fast as well as  face recognisation features is impressiveIt's camera has ARemoji too which is adorableFast processingIt's screen is quite smooth and slipperyIt's light weight as wellSo this is the best option for anyone whose budget is limited but Keen to have smart phone which actually gives the feel of iPhoneü§ó

"
"

  Awesome phone. Totally worth the price.The display and functionality like face unlock and fingerprint scanner works flawlessly.Unfortunately it doesn't support Samsung Dex but If Samsung starts to support Dex on this phone it will be cherry on top.

"
"

  I have been using this mobile from last 1 month and i am totally disappointed with this. i have been facing with network connection issue, slow internet speed and less user friendly system platform. it don't take/switch  to 4Gnetwork easily and i am facing  call drop or poor voice quality to next person. Though they claim it is having fast charging options but still take a long time to charge. i can say it get charge around 40% in an hour. so i am damm sure now..it is waste of money. never going to purchase Samsung product again.

"
"

  what can one say during this pandemic situation? mobile phones are so much important. Trusted brand like samsung  produce such kind of defective phones . No issues when product got delivered but durability and robustness are questionable for such a high end mobile phone brand. Phone just lasted less than a month . Mobile just got dead no response even charging it or trying to get into safe mode. No physical damage ,no accident, no water splashing but mobile stopped working within a month. Risky to suggest this mobile for purchase

"
"

  Samsung galaxy M21 mobile takes around 4 hours to get fully charged, slow process of touch display and also slow in net surfing. I was suggested to let its battery be 0% and then charge after that press power button and volume up button simultaneously then choose rest option,all problem will be resolved  I m still facing facing so many problem regarding my new purchasesed samasung galaxy M21 mobile, no any app are being downloded, and amazon techanician are making me from last 2 days, i m disappointed with amazon, i hardly reccomend to all for not to purchase a single item from amazon, because after selling they dont care for customer and their service.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very good detects quickly battery backup is also very good for normal usages e.g calling and internet surfing (couldnt check while playing games as I don't like playing games on phone) takes two full days to drain from 100 to 0. Camera quality is good but low light photos little disappointed me as those not as good as it should be. Overall quality is good. I like it...

"
"

  M21 is Very good phone.It has very powerful battery no need to charge frequently becouse battery draining is less compare to other mobile and charging time is less due to fast charging.Display quality is impressive than other mobile.Fingerprints sensor increases security feature and made easy to access the phone.The quality image taken by camera is very realistic even night picture quality is also impressive.Designed quality and looking quality is also very good.Price of mobile is moderate according to the futures of the mobile phone

"
"

  Display is just awesome ü§©üî•Anytime i will chose sAMOLED display over 120 hz. I have used both display but sAMOLED makes huge difference than 120hz refresh rate displays. AID is just great.Battery life is also awesome.Samsung ui is also beautiful. I have never thought they have so much features. It is as good as realme ui or MIUI, some features r even better than themProcessor is also good for day to day use.It's face unlock is little bit slow compared to redmi and realme device. Finger print unlock is fast.And last and the most imp IT IS MANUFACTURED IN INDIA and samsung is not a Chinese brand. That is the main reason i chose this device over redmi and realme.

"
"

  Other than the Display, I didn‚Äôt find anything good in this phone. A brand new phone with some 12-13 apps gives so much of lag between touch n processing. I must say I am extremely disappointed with this phone. Camera at times give completely black output. I got so frustrated in a month that I had already sold it. Trust me I never expected such output from Samsung, while I had used S3, S7 & S8 in past. No comparison with them but with the same range phones it stands nowhere

"

  I like  Display  quality.  Build  Quality. Cameras  need  improvement.  But still managing  greatly.  Battery  no words....Overall  I am satisfied.  Having  using the phone since 23/July/2020.Bit of heavy  phone. Would  love if Samsung ships stock android. Maybe  if possible  Samsung can launch  a new series with Stock  Android.  That will be cherry on top.

  One of the best midrange phones in the market as of now and it couldn't get better. It's been a great experience buying this smartphone. I haven't seen these many features in this price range. Camera is top notch. I would recommend this one over any other smartphone as I had done extensive research before buying this phone and I am completely satisfied with the product. Battery life is fantastic. It will last for at least a day and a half with extreme usage. Built quality  is also nice and it feels like an extension  of yourself. Fingerprint reader works as flash and its lightning fast. To summarize my review,  it's a great phone and I recommend everyone to buy it. Thank you Samsung

  Good battery life

  Good mobile under 15K wity best features.Really I didn't expect this much performance and features from samsung mobile in this budget.If your not heavy gamer then Just go for itDont think this is the best mobile ever branded that's itI loved it..But Camara quality not that much hyzine...And have a problem with automatic brightness not working properly

"
"

  Camera should have been better, so that we do not need to bother about Gcam. Sometimes the processors lags even on small tasks which is strange and annoying.As always, the samsung emojis...ugly. Fingerprint is not so fast, it is quick.  Face unlock is awesome.Screen is brilliant and speakers are 8.9/10 and charging speed is 2.5-3 hours. Battery backup is less than expected, good but not upto the mark as expected...would run well for atleast 1.5 day.Overall  7.8/10

"
"

  The best mid range mobile. It come with  a monster battery which runs almost 2 days after 1 time being fully charged.Fingerprint is too quick never disappoints you.Best deal at this price pointIn compare to others it have great camera qwalityBut there is no macroLence.If you are a pro photographer than this point is mising here.But without this it will takes great shotsslo-mo video is very smooth.S-amoled display gives you a next level experience.Highspeed processor but not for pro-gamers.

"
"

  Battery charging is very slow. It takes around 2.30 hours to fully charge. Description of fast charging is illusion. No fast charging at all. It's charger is also looking like normal charger. If any one purchasing it be careful about battery charging.

"
"

  The amoled display that feels smooth and cooperate with 60hz gives a nice feel to touch.Yeah! Good fingerprint sensor pretty fast.The massive 6000mah battery that longs for 36 hours.Pretty good camera that makes you satisfy.The exynos 9611 is an old chip but for multimedia experience it is good and fast,yeah!fast.You can play heavy games like pubg,Pes but not with high graphics,it will hang so, don't play with heavy graphics.Heating issue is less than m31 but still it heat some times when play games or heavy usage.Totally a good budget phone from Samsung.Hope I cover the total review for this phone.

"
"

  Beautiful design, clean os. But Performance is not good in this price range. I have more expectations with camera but its results was not satisfactory. Fingerprint scanner most of the time doesn't work. In this price range we get many good smartphone.Previously I was using redmi note 7 pro and my experience was v.good. only I bought Samsung device because of clean os and made in india product. This phone is not for gamers.

"
"

  This is first time I am using the samsung and I m loving it. This M21 is amazing in every sense as with 6000 mah battery it gives you a booster for your every work.Its around a 15 days from my purchase and its wonderful experience till now.Fingerprint Reader is good but as it is given backside can be one of the concern for persons who are not easy to it.Battery life is awesome as well the power mode gives you a good backup too.The UI is amazing with android 10.1.Camera is amazing as per the price range.

"
"

  HelloSo my review about this product is after my usage of 2 monthsI bought this phone 64/4 for Rs 12699/-For that price phone is pretty good now Samsung increased the pricingThe 6000 mAh Battery Samsung is giving but the performance is too bad I'm getting barely 1-day usage may the Exynos processor eats battery fastly.Tripple camera setup is goodFor small gaming, purpose phone gives a great performance

"
"

  Received today and first look is nice, s-amoled display really let u knw what colors can b.Plug in earphones and turn on Dolby settings, u'll feel the difference.Back panel is not that bad and anyways almost eveyone use case /cover, so no complaints.Battery is big plus.If u r not a heavy gamer go for it.Camera is also gud, pictures are vibrant.

"
"

  Those who think about buying realme and Redmi products, try this one...... guys don't fry your brains and eyes.  Samoled is just cool  and sar value is half of Chinese products.  Why would you want to looseSome years of your life

"
"

  The product does not matches with specifications. Camera quality is not upto the mark, initial camera issues as selfie capture does not display for the first time you open camera. Also, don't know if 48MP is matching. Battery draines quickly, takes more time to charge as well.

"
"

  It's 6 Ram performance was very good camera quality is also good and the best thing is about the battery the battery is of 6000mah ti charge it in the morning and use it till night and in the night it's 40% left that is to much it has good charger that is of 15 watt and the charger pin is different from other smartphone that's why we can't charge it with other smartphone charger it takes approximately 2 hour to charge from 0% to 100%because it is of 6000mah this phone is very good in this price

"
"

  After use of 1 month.Battery = ExcellentCamera = AverageFunction and operations = Not impressive ( in detail, Not having basic feature of inbuilt App lock, screenshot of limited portion of screen, camera shutter sound disable, sometimes not responding quickly, front/selfie camera don't have night mode option, more app needed to be installed to use some features in camera e.g. slow motion, cannot delete/uninstall inbuilt Apps even though not needed to you, sometimes even fingerprint censor don't work.)I thought it will impress me while using. However, it's an average phone.

"
"

  Best samsung smartphone under 14000,Battery is best...  After using it for three days this is my opinion on battery life which can be changed after couple of days-One hour game of pubg lite - 10%On heavy usage can easily last upto one day....Screen is best no complain.Camera features are best...It also have ar emoji which is in iphone  but it doesn't work properlyüòÖOverall best smartphone for non-gamer.And camera quality in day light is ü§òüòùü§ò fantastic.

"
"

  Perfect budget phone with a monster battery, camera quality is best in comparison to middle segment smartphones, processor is also smooth,  It runs high ending games very well with no lags unless you play pubg at extreme mode, currently I am playing asphalt 9 legend in it and it runs very smoothly on this and , secondly its display, man super amoled display is next level , in this segment you will never find a mobile with amoled screen, loved the display loved the blacks..

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 Is An Powerful Beast In My Opinion From Big Trusted Brand Samsung Because It Offers Big 6000mah Battery And Stunning Samoled Display At Just 14k In Midrange Segment Which Is A Wonderful Thing About This Mobile And Camera Also Good But Need Some Improvement In Low Light And Need Some Optimization In Battery And Also Every Feature In This Mobile Is Good.Coming To Performance Exynos 9611 Performs Well In This Price And It is Good For Daily Tasking.So Coming To The Conclusion It Is an Best Mobile At 14K.So Dont Bother To Buy It And Just Go For It.Finally About Amazon Is Its Delivery Is Fast.THANK YOU......

"
"

  Midbudget phone with amazing features.. Best feature is the 6000MAH battery that lasts 2 days. The camera is as good as the perception people are having of samsung. Photos are mesmerizing. Never hanged in a month.Pros:1. Battery life2. Camera quality is amazing3. Performance of the phone is very satisfying4. Connectivity with devices are also smooth.5. Sound quality is excellent.Cons: 1. charging time- the battery takes 3 hours to charge, however it is justified with the prolonged backup it provides.2. Bulky

"
"

  Most of the time Network Coverage is poor on the cell, while it's excellent on mobile sets of other make. Never expected this kind of product from Samsung. Won't recommend a buy. Product really sucks as far as call quality is concerned.

"
"

  You wont get an AMOLED display in any other phone in this price range.Redmi/real me users wont be happy with the pictures in this phones, as it is more on the natural looking side.Battery as advertised lasts longer since it is 6000mah.

"
"

  The first mobile which I got was not good in sound quality, battery charging  and connectivity. But after exchange the mobile which I got is value for money. The features like screen cast to PC is much smooth and easy to use. And the other feature I liked is  screenshot one can take whole web page in one slide with ease without difficulty of pressing power and volume button again and again. It takes around 3 hrs to full charge and gives backup  more than 1 day of normal use(mean without pubg).However fingerprint reader is not too sensitive sometimes I have to put my finger 2-3 times to unlock.

"
"

  Excellent phone with normal usage.  I am not a gamer. Daily work is super smooth.  Battery is excellent, it lasts almost 2 days. I had purchased @ 14999/- 6/128. It is my suggestion use auto restart twice in a week. It never lags. Using almost 30 days. In this price, it is very good phone for day to day usage.

"
"

  Delivery was pretty good... About phone it's as displayed to see in real... Back camera is really good.. Day time front cam quality is good..also while taking selfy  we appear good and when we look at the pic it seems like kind of faded.. But still not so bad.. During night a kind of yellowish our face looks.. Overall good product for the price.. Performance wise so far I'm satisfiedpretty good I like it.. Its been 3 months  since I bought it..

"
"

  So far performance of the phone is good . But battery performance is not good.6000 mah battery is lasting a day or even less than a day under full display on watching movies or video recording through camera.Camra quality is good in live focus mode but is 48mp back camera is not at all worthy compared to other A series phones of samsung of same budget.Sound recording quality is good enough but for Video recordings I think performance is not so good.However sAmoled display is really very impressive to watch videos and movies.

"
"

  Excellent mid range budget phone for multimedia  userWhy should we buy1 For best battery backup2 For colorful and immersive sAmoled Screen3 For clean and ad free OneUiWhy not to buy1 It can play all heavy games easily but it is not gaming  phone & heating issue after some time2 Camera is decent not upto the markIt is good for me i knows  my requirements  according to it is best phone for me

"
"

  Plz dont buy this Samsung Galaxy m21. Itz front indoor camera is below below below below average. Battery is good.. bwt according to performance, itz a complete zero. Itz Mike is also not workingI wanted to return this. Bwt amazon is fooling itz customers.. i never expected such poor services.If you'll not return/replace mobile if your customer is not satisfied by itz perfomance,  then Why you have given an opt 'performance and inadequate quality' . Remove this option na then,if you will not return on this basis.Even then Samsung m21 is good. Bwt amazon services is very very bad..

  Writing this review after using this phone for more than 50 days and purchasing another model for fiancee, The phone is superb and value for money in this price range.Excellent battery life, Good camera quality.Ample memory to multitask.Phone doesn't hang or freeze.Overall, Great phone with great features.

"
"

  This product is very good. Battery life easily retains for 34hours approx of an usage of Instagram, YouTube, whatsapp and chrome usage. If you play games for 2-3 hours then the phone still could last for 26-27 hours. No lag detected till now after the usage of 2 weeks and the one ui is perfect except one thing which is bad is we can't use goodlock to have more customization in the ui. The rear camera is a beast in this prize range. Game performance is very good in medium and low settings. Overall I like the product as I am not a mobile phone game enthusiast it is a perfect phone for me.

"
"

  I gotta say in this price this phone is best in the market right now. As I've been using this for now almost a month I detected someone of bit glitchs which may not affect phone's dignity . It gets start lagging when it's ROM gets 70% full and it's night vision of cemera is not as much satisfactory as I thought before. I'd like to inform you ( whoever reading this ) when you go to live mode of it's front camera you will be disappointed. The rest of like bettary beackup is awesome. It can give as much using time as you are thinking 6000mah can give you . There's no criticized about display .

  i am using about 1 month ,samsung galaxy m21 is one of the best non chinese smartphone at this price range ,i wonderd that a samung phone having best battery backup in this price range and security wise its safe i feel better security when i use this phone and not that samsung m21 is not the bestest gaming phone in this price ,so aware of that otherwise the best display quality of this phone amazes samsung giving super Amoled display at this price range,best camera quality ,fingerprint sensor not much good,but i am happy to say that i am very satisfied with samsung galaxy m21 ,and thumbs up to amazon for better packing delivery of this phone ‚ô•Ô∏è

"
"

  It's an amazing phone with all round features. No cons were spotted so far. Its perfectly ok for Non gamers/ light gamers. Not meant for Pro gamers. Except that, everything is top notch. Happy that I've bought a better phone from a Non Chinese brand.

"
"

  M21 is the best Samsung device you can get near 15k.Sells on amazon definitely üçí on cake for the price.6000 Mah Battery is more than adequate with fast charger.Amolioed display is multimedia totally killer.Cons. -1. No protecting case in box. Even 5k phn come include it.2. Lots of UI glitch.3. Camera sharpness could have been better.4. Camera stability needs improvement.5. Plastic body feels cheap and frequently got fingerprint and dirts.6.  Dolby atoms not at all shows any difference in sound.

"
"

  I'm impressed with this m21 phone it's a budget phone but has so many needed features for eg.Big battery but yea it doesn't support fast charging so it takes almost 3 hrs to charge fully.Also I realised that the battery only lasted me for 1 day but yea I'm a heavy user so I can consider it normal.Secondly it's camera is superb but greens look boosted and wide angle is very wide also selfies are not that attractive.Thirdly I loved the always on display features and its amoled display it's very impressive.Face unlock is a bit slow as per what I think but it's fyn.Fingerprint is fast.Overall loved the product.

"
"

  display is goodbattery not as expected...9hourss of screen on time of which 7hrs net oncamera quality is good at the price rangeperfomance is ok..not much betterlight weight..is its advantage over redmi note 9 prowhenplaying  youtube and go back to home of youtube..it freezed  mann  timesheating issue is there occasionaly..not too muchim using a case so design is not aproblem for mefinally..if you are ok with the look of phone and not a gamer..and expecting.an ok perfomanceand love to watch vedioes and movies non stop.m21 make a logical sense..

"
"

  Honestly after using this mobile 2 weeks I can say it's 99 out of 100. It's display, battery, performance, camera all are awesome. üíØ(See the pictures I have clicked )I was wondering which I should I buy M31 or M21. Now I'm that I choose M21 model 6GB RAM, cause both are same as twins only difference is between there camera setup which is very less according to me. Cause I have seen both mobile's cameras pictures and no one can tell the difference at broader level. I fully satisfied with this Galaxy M21 üòÅ

"
"

  Touch screen wad not at all working so I requested for a replacement which was done at a amazing speedy way and new mobile is awesome and as per my expectations, thank you Amazon, their CCE and Samsung

"
"

  Good - display, battery backup, user interface, network reception, call quality, wifi speed, in hand feel, always on displayAverage - built quality, charging speed, speakerBelow average - cameraAll in all an excellent buy for someone looking for a mobile specifically for media (social, entertainment) consumption with good battery life. I have bought it for my mother.

"
"

  I brought  this Samsung  M21 before  20 days. It's  fingerprint  sensor  is not properly  working,  it works  for 1-2 days only. Agter every 2 days I hv to disable and remove  fingerprint  lock and creat again the new one. It's  screen  is also  nt working  properly.  And the last one , I was scared  to buy Samsung  just because  of  its  hanging  problem  bt the features  shown that it  will  not hanging  but the hanging  problem  of Samsung  products  is still  with  itself.  Sorry Samsung,  I made again mistake  by trusting  on ur product.  I couldn't  got the product  as I spend money  again  it. Overall  not satisfactory  product.

"
"

  Phone is average and really disappointed with network problem and battery. Battery is behaving like 4000mah battery and draining fast. I am facing network problem also . On total not satisfied with this purchase. Can't believe Samsung is bringing such products what you can't recommend to others. Still believing in updates they may resolve all issues .

"
"

  Though we could not expect much in this range(Rs.15000), there are few issues which really make this phone useless.Pros :1) As usual super amoled display is good.2) Battery backup is good.Cons :1) Though this mobile has got 6gb ram, my old mobile with 2gb ram is much better than this. To open mail, it is taking hell of time.2) Speaker is the worst part of this mobile. A basic model phone will have a better speaker than this phone.3) Phone is bit heavy. Probably because of battery size.All i can say is mobiles with 4000-4500mah battery and 4gb ram would be a better choice than this mobile.

"
"

  I purchased this phone in prime day sale. I used this galaxy M21 phone and my experience with this phone is this phone touch and display is so cool and its camera quality so much good and its fingerprint sensor is faster than other smartphone of this price range and this Phone comes with two days Monster battery which is most interesting part of this phone its support Dolby atmos as well as 4I vedio this Phone comes with exynoss 9611 processor you can se this processor in other samsung phones of higher range.At last I say you if you are a samsung smartphone lover and you want to buy a  Indian manufactured phone then you go for it.

"
"

  Please dont buy samsung M 21.  All pieces seems to be defective.  I went to Samsung service center and find 3 more customers facing the same issue.Within 1 month of purchase screen display is gone. Service center says it happened because of pressing on phone.  Everyone same reason.This phone is being used by Father and they are genuinely careful about their phones and no heavy game plays in.Even though my phone is within warranty.  They are saying this display issue is not covered in warranty.Please dont buy this phone.

"
"

  Volume button and power button were worn out and paint had come off. If you're looking for a good screen and clean neat OS it's a cheap alternative to the other brands. But quality is not what it looks like in the pictures. Rest is okay.

"
"

  After my MI 8's early demise, I was gifted this phone and this exceeds my expectations. It's sleek and easy to hold. Definitely better in performance and ease of usage than the former. I love the display; bright and that matte look when Night mode is turned on.Sound quality is able enough to quench my thirst for good music. The rear camera is good and allows decent night photographs. Could have been a tad better though in terms of clarity and availability of features. Rarely lags or freezes.64 GB is too less considering the exponential rise in number of applications.I have already recommended this phone and I will. Thanks

"
"

  Yes there r some cons1.camara is not like 48mp it's nearly about 25-30mp not more then that, though selfie camara is great.2. Samsung could give atleast18-20 watt power adapterbcuz with this 15 watt it takes nearly 3.5 hours to 0 to 100% charge.Pros:1. Processor is good.2. 6000 mah is literally great .3. Look and weight is good.4. Gaming is quiet good.Also I guess if you r looking for a good phone of Samsung and confused between m21 &m31! Just Go with m21 6,128gb model . Difference is just 64 -48 mp , other then that both r complete twins.Best mid range android.üíØ

  Hey guys,I am using these phones since more than 2 months and the best part of these is its wide angle camera quality , the overall performance is ok specially the battery capacity is not so wow as per 6000mah. If u r not a pro means 24*7 user of phones and all like that stuff these phone is the best at these budget segmentThank you,Hope it help.

  I have been purchasing mobiles online for personal use since the last 8 years but this mobile has given me the worst experience ever.The touchscreen stopped working after 10 days and sadly Amazon has a return policy of only 7 days.I had to visit the Samsung service center to get it checked but shockingly I could find 50+ customers having similar issues with M series mobiles. All the mobiles were less than 3 months old.This is the worst experience Samsung and Amazon can give to their customers.I Do Not recommend M series mobiles to anyone.

"
"

  I bought it for my son of 13 years age. We all have been using iphones in my family since last 10 years. However, I like the features of this phone. My son also liked it very much. No complaint since the date I bought it . I.e.  in last 2 months

"
"

  It Is a good budget smartphone for everyone. I loved the 48mp back camera as it clicks awsome photos and also in perfect lighting you can click good pictures as like photos clicked from DSLR. The Samsung US is also good and also the screen is also have a good refreshing rate. I don't liked the front camera that much because it's just saturat you photo at higher amount and also not make it realistic. It's just like using buety mode in a higher level. But in daylight it performs good.Else the phone is good, the batter and the sound is the best you can get in a budgeted smartphone.

"
"

  I have purchased this phone after see all good features  but my phone after 15 days it will hang and when I go service  center  I have waste there one days but they can not solve my problem  after i will go second  time they told your phone mother board need to change and they changed my phone mother boardI am not satisfied with this phone due to my new phone within 15 i have to change mother board of phoneBad quality by Samsung M21Battery  life is excellentCamara and speaker is also excellentHD quality is good

"
"

  Just loved the phone.This is my first Samsung phone.And just amazed with battery performance.Thank you samsung for giving us such a lovely phone at this price segment.First bought black colour for me and now bought blue colour for my mom as well.

"
"

  It has a beautiful samoled display. Perfect for watching movies and series on the phone. The battery life is on another level. The phone has a maximum power saving mode with which the battery will last many days. The camera quality was surprisingly very clear! The processor has also been great so far. If you're looking for a phone for streaming content and for not so heavy gaming (you can play pubg without problems on this phone) this phone is perfect in this price range! It also has the added benefit of a great camera and a battery which lasts so long you'll be surprised. Go for it!

"
"

  Waste Product, dont by samsung mobiles friends... i previously used Redmi Note 5 its Good Product but Samsung Galaxy M21 is Worst product...Camera is waste...Heating Problem...Yesterday only i received in onday usage i felt very worst i bought in my life...Dear friends please anyone guide me how to return this product...

"
"

  Battery life is not as per specifications it will last for only 5 hrs and having network issue same informed to Amazon to replace my product but they r providing inspection service by technician .the date was fixed by the customer care executive  on 24 aug but one day before am getting message that it reschedule to 7 September. So what it means I need to keep this mobile till september 7 without any use. What kind of service is this. Again I reschedule the date to 25 aug. And in particular I need to mention the complaint abt product was raised in next day after received the product.

"
"

  ¬†Screen looks classy and display is rich and vivid .Touch of this phone is very smooth. Battery life is also good.sound quality is excellent. Camera quality is sufficient, in very high darkness it lacks.Only I was thinking before buying about a color by seeing at YouTube and Amazon reviews it looks like toy and like blue plastic. but when you use this it is rich royal blue color , something like metallic blue. So phone looks simple and classy. In 14k you can't buy any gaming phone. 17k plus needed. So this deal I can recommend.

"
"

  I purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 (6GB ram, Blue) in Amezon one month ago. Delivery of mobile is in good condition and in time.Best Battery life, it stands 1.5 days (nornal use).Best screen (4.8 out of 5)Battery (5 out of 5)Camera (4.6 out of 5)Performance (4.5 out of 5)Different new options (4.6 out of 5)Sound quality (4.5 out of 5)Charging time (4.3 out of 5) (approximately in 3 minutes it charges 2 percentage, so 100 percentage in 150 minutes.In short, it is a best phone for normal useager.

"
"

  Value for money.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

"
"

  I wanted to buy a smart phone that is in my budget but Chinese is not there at all.  Overall my search ended by going to Samsung's Galaxy M21.  I prefer processor capacity, screen resolution, battery MAH in a good handset.  Its big features are 6000 MAH battery, 2340X1080 screen resolution and 2.3, 1.7 GHz octa core processor.  Apart from this, other features of this mobile such as Corning Gorilla Glass 3, Super AMOLED screen, 48 MP back camera and 20 MP front camera are also excellent.  It has been a week for me with the handset today.  Overall I am completely satisfied with the phone.

"
"

  Amazing phone.Pros.1. Amazing battery life2. Nice amoled display.3. Average camera4. Good sensor5. Good gaming experience (pubg in smooth resolution and not in HD)Cons.1. Takes huge time to get charged.2. Little heavy

"
"

  It is good phone if you are looking non Chinese phone, Display is very good battery life is excellent, finger print is also good, camera is good specially in day light, ultra wide sensor is very good, processor is good day to day usageOverall phone is good

"
"

  This is a very good phone for buying for your parents as the battery life is very good. Charge it once and you will not have to look at it for atleast 40 hours. This is seriously good. The software is good and is smooth and there is not much bloatware. Now to see how this phone behaves in the long run as the mid rangers of samsung are notorius to slow down after 2 years or so

"
"

  Hi,I left MI Chinese mobiles due to Chinese deception on Border and took this Samsung M21.With 4100 mah, it was much superior performance with 6000 msh of Samsung M21.Also the phone heats when charging. However Note 4 was never heated.Giving multiple features only is not good, but performance of the overall phone should be good in which M21 is not overall good. Battery performance is the worst.Even Camera zoom doesn't work normally.Hotspot impact is very bad on 4 meters.

"
"

  The phone looks good(Midnight blue looks better than that in product description. ). Camera quality is good. You get many options like hyperlapse . Battery life is also good. Display is also awesome . Phone fits in hands. Not too big. Best in this range.EDIT: After 1 month use i can notice that mobile heats while using mobile data in a rapid rate. Still I will say that this is one of the best mobile phone in this range. I have experienced no lag in performance. Go for it. No doubt.

"
"

  Overall an excellent phone. Full charged battery last 12  hours of extensive usage with data on for me. I guess the whole idea of megapixels is a gimmick. When compared with 13 mp phone ,there is hardly any big difference. Will update my review after using for some time.

"
"

  The phone was delivered on 23rd May 2020. I bought this phone for my mother, she is a light user and use phone mainly for calling purposes. Today 1st July 2020, phone has stopped charging. After some time started giving error like ""overheating"" .  Haven't expected such quality from a company like Samsung. Making cheap phones does not mean that they should compromise with Quality.

"
"

  It has heating problem from very first charge and battery Darin very fast. Camera also not good in comparison other mobile with same configuration. I replace the product but this set also have same product. I want refund but they suggested me long process. Now technician visit and decide whether refund money or not. Don't buy such low quality phone.

  Its day 2, still going though the mobile. I would like to ask seller regarding the warranty. how do i get the warranty card with date of purchased on it.

  Galaxy M21 is just awesome in this price range, quick fingerprint scanner, camera quality is very good, good battery life no need to worry about charging every few hours. Quality gaming experience, Dolby sound charges real quick, a better option in 15000 range. Please give updates quickly as you give on a high range device. Would be helpful in keeping up with security and few more camera options needed. Can't find shutter sound setting, it also clicks macro shots without a dedicated macro camera. Overall it's a better option to go for in non Chinese company. Photos uploaded are click with M21.

  Everything is good.... Look... Camera.. Battery but the most important thing which I don't like about this phone that is heating issue. Ya this phone Samsung Galaxy M21 has heating issue while charging or even in using in less than 15 minutes. Overall delivery, product and services is good. But the phone has heating issue on the upper part of phone while charging and using.

  The phone looks cheap with plastic back. I am using this for 20 days now and the touch pad is giving me problems. Keys have become non responsive and touch is not getting sensed in 4 spots on screen. Never expected such pathetic quality from Samsung. I will be going to service center tomorrow. Really sad even after spending so much received such a bad quality phone.

"
"

  I am happy with this mobile's performance, though I have observed these:1.When the PIN is typed to open the mobile, the number I typed is visible for over 2 seconds. Also, need to hit Ok, which is not necessary.2.When an on going call is ended,  it takes 5 seconds to show the recently called contacts so that we can make some other call.Since I am using 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM variant, performance is not the reason,  but its software has been programmed that way.3.I miss my previous Redmi which vibrates once the call is picked up at the other end.

  I love phone screen(1080p Super Amoled),battery capacity and Earphones sound(Dolby Atmos enabled when earphones connected).In hand this phone feel light considering large 6000Mah battery and easily use it with One hand Things I like to improve -1)Processor of this phone.Samsung must consider Snapdragon chipsets in their Mid-range devices.2)Plastic Body(especially back without glass protection).3)Mono speaker4)Fast charging(Adapter support greater than 15W)

  I personally like phones in black colour but due to unavailability of raven Black I had to go for midnight blue and trust me i loved it.It looks totally different from the pictures over internet. This phone is simply amazing in mid range budget phones with excellent battery life and a smart look.Galaxy M21 camera is giving good competition to other phones and it has several settings too which you can enjoy.The shots taken from this phone are really beautiful and it just captures the views at night perfectly as i have uploaded a picture.And fingerprint reader also works quite well.And many other helpful settings are thereüëçüèª.

  I wasn't expecting this from Samsung Products.Hardly its been few days i brought this brand new handset.It is getting heated instantly without even much usage( I haven't even played a game) I use Whats app,Instagram and do some calls that is it. Also this so called handset is famous for its battery.But its draining really fast . I mean for normal calls it is consuming up to 12- 15 percent. Seriously is this the way you treat your customers?  Totally disappointed for receiving such a damaged product. I have applied for replacement or refund.Lets see where it will head towards.  Hope they will solve this issue as soon as possible.

  I got a used piece I came to know that when im trying to login the facebook which shows an unknown mail id in the place of login and the mail id may be belongs to the person who used it previouslyWhen u connect to the charger, the charging will be starting after 5 mins of connectionLoudspeaker is very defective some time it wont work ie, it is not  working once in a 10 timesSamsung is well known for hanging and it is hanging atleast trice in a day for 10-15 secondsI have encountered all this problems in only 3 days and I have returned the productPlease try to avoid this phone

"
"

  Writing this review after using the phone for 2 months.Overall the phone is excellent option in this price range with wonderful camera quality.  I have used Motorola, Microsoft & Nokia android mobiles before but this phone beats all the devices mentioned before in terms of UI and camera.Pros1. Elegant look2. Best camera under this price3. UICons1. Takes almost 2.5 -3 hours for full charge from 20%. Not a good option if you need a superfast charge phone.

"
"

  Its te best buy I have done in my life. Something good happen in my life in todays Covid-19 pandemic situation.It has monster battery. I had turned ON Internet when I started my journey from my home in Kachchh to Valsad. It took around 13 hours to reach the destination. Upon reaching Valsad, I saw 56 % battery remaining on the screen. So it has excellent battery life. Also having Fast Charging.Camera is also excellent.Amazing feature I liked most is Bixby Vision, which can search anything you like.I will conclude with a statement that it is flagship phone for those who can't afford real flagship phones.

"
"

  M21  is pretty cool1.Long battery2.Great display3.Pretty good camera4. You can do multitasking  pretty good the phone does not lags at allI mean we can use 3 to 4 app at same time with out any issue.Processor is fine for playing normal games.Fingerprint and face unlock is pretty slowI once tried COD it was working fine but after playing for some time there was heating (no too high temperature)Charging takes approx 3 hours ü§îü§îüßêPretty hectic to chargeThe charger heat up a lot. Company do not provide a back case so the back gets scratched easily .üò≠üò≠

  I have used many phone, but with this product, I feel very pleasant, battery life carefree, budget phone, camera is nice, fingerprint sensor is fast, everything we can do this phone, now what do we need more. This is very good for me. Thank you Samsung. Thank you seller.

  Within two months of usage, display replaced at authorised service centre, now touch is not responding at all, waiting to take it again to the centre once lockdown is over. Pethatic phone, heating issues, bateery changing is terribly slow.

  Samsung M21, Received today on 16/08/2020 in healthy condition, Thanks to amazon again proving the safe and in time delivery.Mobile is cost worthy, all you can have in this power pack, it's touch is silky, body to screen ration more than 90%. The only negatives are following.1) No Ear phone,2) No screen Saver3) No phone coverIn this range Vivo n Oppo will be providing you with these things.Thanks again.

"
"

  Here comes Samsung galaxy M21 it's the best in class, premium design look Its actually a real monster in performance, camera quality is good, battery really stay for longer time in frequent usage, and fingerprint sensor is very fast. Exynos 9611 octa core processor it's very fast, does not hangs at all. Samsung is a good brand globally No.1, maintaining standard products, good quality, and economical price. Iam actually reviewing this after using for a week and i highly recommend this product for everyone, don't look for negative reviews just go for it you will be happy by using the product.

  I have the 4GB 64GB varient.... This is a great phone for daily tasks such as browsing, YouTube, Social media, etc., However if you are into competitive gaming on a budget, this phone would not be a good choice. The front camera is not that great considering the specs and I can say with confidence that the battery is not 6000 mah. Don't get me wrong it's a good battery you'll be able to get thorough the day with a single charge, but I think it's definitely not 6000 mah since I had a phone with 4000 mah battery before this, and it also gave me the same battery life! Overall best budget phone and I highly recommend it!

"
"

  phone is working very good.samoled display and 6000 mah battery just nails it.this experience is amazing.processor is decent .Its just okay okay ,neither good nor bad.  phone gets hot instantly when you play pubg .the biggest con or i can say fraud is the fast chargingcompany is fooling people saying you get a 15w charger in the box. because it is a 5v 2a that is 10w charger and printed with fast charging .It means you just get written that it is a fast charger but in reality it is not.phone takes 2hrs. 45min. to charge from 0% to 100%.

"
"

  I purchased a samsung M21 Phone recently with great expectation, Its a good phone  and most of the features are good. But the basic feature of making calls is very poor.  I contacted samsung, spend a day on their suggestions, no use. This phone simply  cannot be used for average network.. I have used MI and Moto with the same service provider, its working fine.  If you live close to a mobile tower and do not travel , this phone is good for you. Never expected this from such a reputed brand--- A phone which cannot be used for making calls. see the difference in network on MI and Samsung

"
"

  The phone didn't turn on.  It doesn't display anything. I even kept for charge, still nothing. Only i can hear is volume button sound. Its defective piece. Not trustworthy even after its made in india. I would really prefer Chinese brand then. How can this be reason of not working i dont understand,there are quality test and other test performed and still a defective piece. Fully disappointed! I had been waiting for about 1.5 month phone to be available back in stock. I was about to order redmi pro 9 but I didn't, I made a mistake by trusting this Samsung.

"
"

  This phone has vibrant display and lead to excellent  viewing experience. Battery life is satisfactory.  Fingerprint and face unlock is little bit slower.  Good camara but phone has some heating problem while using Camara and calling  . Signal strength of mobile networks in this phone is poor  compare other  manufacturers  . I am not a gamer,so there is no gaming experience. This phone is excellent choice for those who like streaming online videos like Amazon prime.

"
"

  I have just used it for a week and everything seems fine till now. Let me sum up pros and cons according to me being a normal user (I don't do much gaming on phones so..)...Pros..SAMOLED display1.5-2 days battery backup (normal use)Cons..Camera is descent not upto par with similar priced phones of other brandsBack cover is not smudge free ie it doesn't stay clean and so it's looks suffer therefore better buy a back cover with itSo overall it's a great phone if you only want to stream media for longer hours.

"
"

  Phone Display does not work at all. Waited for days for it start working. Restarted many times. restart does not help.First time launch worked and phone got updated and restarted and after that display is not responsive at all.I am now returning it back. Bad experience with Samsung M21.- Received the replacement phone today, will see how this one works. Hoping it should work after an update and restart. Will increase the rating after usage of the phone If it works as needed.

"
"

  hello all,previously I was using vivo,  just for a sentiment I brought this mobile.dislikes:1, internet speed is very less while accessing in this Samsung Galaxy m21.2, very slow and hard gaming is not possible3, apps don't work smoothly in this mobile.4, beside 6000 mAh battery we can use for 6 hrsI can give 1 extra star for its 128 GB memory and 6 GB ram,  but we don't feel we operating in 6Gb mobiletried to resend this mobile, but return policy finished at 17 July 2020.  I feel this mobile is not worthy for 15999.  main thing I noticed is mobile slow software.

"
"

  Using since last 3 months.Good phone with no problems at all... Camera is very good.Battery is powerful last for 1.5 days if charged 100%Normal heating issues... but that's in all the Samsung phones.In short good budget phone for normal use.Initially was afraid of buying online because of the comments. But am happy that I bought it.Satisfied with the phone.

"
"

  Pros:‚Ä¢ Nice battery backup.‚Ä¢ Less weight even though it has massive 6000mAh.‚Ä¢ Good display.Cons:‚Ä¢ The processor is not performing up to expectation. If you want a smooth performance please go for redmi or realme.‚Ä¢ Even for normal usage, the phone is sometimes lagging. Have to restart the phone once it starts lagging, which is irritating sometimes.‚Ä¢ Fingerprint reader doesn't work too well.If you want a smooth performance please go to redmi or realme, this phone is not for you!

"
"

  Excellent product. Thanks for Samsung and Amazon.I got the product within four days after booking.Camera is superb and far better than my redmi note 8.Super Amoled display and dolbi atmos gives good movie experience. I am not a heavy gamer. So I don't know about that area. The slow motion mode and super slow motion mode makes our vedios more perfect. There are some additional features like  always on display.Samsung gave me more than I expected. I recommend this phone to all who are searching for a phone under 15000 rupees.

"
"

  This is a genuine review after using the phone for 1 month.the phone is really very awesome .all the features are good there are some unique features then other brand phones. Both the cameras are really awesome. Display is cool. Security is good performance is good user interface is very good .connectivity is better then other brand phones. Mostly i like AR emoji feature. everything is superb .but the only thing need to be inprove is it heating, the phone gets to much heated üî•

"
"

  My phone was hanging. Problem. showing Samsung logo only.but now its ok  ididnt do any think..camera is good but feel difficulty to focus most time picture get blured slighty .Battery back up is  good......

"
"

  Mobile is fast and also have a good processor speed. Easy to use and very good amoled scrren for usage. But battery is not good as 6000mah as it may last only for 12 hours once fully charged using it average. It should last 22 - 24 hours as per 6000mah.

"
"

  The battery lasts long but charging takes too much time, even it supports fast charge also. 48MP is just config at theory level I think. Picture quality is not that good and flash is also of lower quality, it's not enough bright.Overall phone is good. 1 more thing annoyed us is pre-installed lots of apps, some of them do not have option to un-install.

"
"

  I was really impressed with the camera quality and huge storage. The focus of the lens is really sharp, just as I like it. Although something about the front camera's position used to bother me initially, being in the centre and all, I'm used to it now. Battery life is longer compared to my previous phone but I can't say that's too much. Sound system is nice too.As a whole I don't regret buying this product.

"
"

  Well done Samsung!! Extremely happy with my Galaxy M21. Superb Fingerprint reader, extraordinary battery, exquisite display and nice camera quality. The only thing to be average is the performance. Although it has an above decent performance, it is a little weak for heavy tasking like gaming. My humble request to Samsung is to release an software update or any other slight modification so that it improves the performance and reduces heating. I am satisfied with other things. I have four mobiles in my home all of which are Samsung and so I hope that it would do necessary updates so that the heating reduces and performance gets a little better.

"

  Best phone rather than vivo oppo or redmi i love to use sumsang and the processer is very fast and the battery backup is very good which is 6000 mh which till upto 2 day. Thank alot and also #BOYCOTT CHAINESE mobile. JAY HIND üáÆüá≥

  ¬†After a month I am giving my reviews. RAM is somewhere lagging.Screen flickers some times while searching on google.Other mobile that I am having has no such issue.I compared both at same time and same site.See the vdo of M21.Camera also has some issues.When clicked a photo, it shows photo taken & after a second it's totally black, no photo available.Let's hope it will not create major issues in future.

"
"

  Those who are looking for samsung brand just go with this.Pros :1) Best display in the price  segment2) One UI is also Excellent, it is clean , lag free smooth experience3) Processor is also good no lags, but not recommended for gaming4) 6000mah battey is a monster for full working day even in extreme usage5) Back camera clarity is excellent and this is great improvement over m30sCons:1) Takes 2 - 30 min to full charge2) front camera would have better but3) Can play casual games but heavy games like pubg

"
"

  The User Experience is really good, The Camera quality seems Great when compared to the price.I use the Mobile internet surfing a lot, and haven't experienced heat or hanging display, which is pretty awesome.I am currently working from home so the hotspot is always on and I am having meeting calls all the time., but still the mobile handles it as if it is nothing which most other mobiles don't, they either get heated or start to hang which leads to restarting the mobile often. so I am giving it a 5 Star. If you are looking for a good mobile on affordable price this Samsung Galaxy M21 is the best choice.

"
"

  I got damaged/defective product. After return request the delivery boy came to pick up the product but he didn't pick up as he said he didn't get any mail from amazon for the pick up of defective product. Then I talked to Amazon customer care regarding this ,he said that next time product will be picked up  there will be no problem. But next day again the delivery boy told the same. From 8th September the delivery came 5 times and till now he didn't pick up the product. I also talked to Amazon customer care many times regarding this but no positive response till now  .

"
"

  Amazing product from samsung. I wasn't a fan of Samsung however thought to give a try after being away for some years.It is amazing phone. I am not a gaming person so not worried on that side. Battery is enormous, lasts longer but also takes time to recharge. Fingerprint sensor is quick enough to react. Many more thoughtful features are packed in this phone. The camera is amazing with whatever features I've tested so far. The AMOLED display is amazing as well with vivid colors and various reading modes to adjust with light around. Overall it is value for money.

"
"

  This phone is best product in price 14.000rs , this phone has 6000 mah battery life and it last long for normal users for 2 days easily , an as you know Samsung gives best display same Samsung m21 comes with super amoled screens , also its camera is so awesome , in your every pic will be best, its fingerprint reader is so fast ,And it comes with android 10 ,If you need samsung phone in 14,000rs this is the best for you , and I have ordered it in black , pubg is also working so best . Thanks Samsung

"
"

  Likes - Super amoled at 14000 , 6000 mAh Battery , UI without adds , Amazing camera at this cost , dolby atmos , only 188 gm with this huge batterydislikes - got scratch on back just in one day (Need Improvement)  , Gorilla Glass 3 (Can improve) , Want samsung switch app feature , processor is decent but at this point others provide better deal but in front of likes samsung balances ,Anyone can buy if they dont play game , this processor can run game also but you will get some frame drops at medium to high settingsall over value for money

  Honestly speaking after using this phone for around 2 months... Everything's great about this phone..1.Perfect battery backup.2.S-AMOLED display are much better than IPS.3.Camera's perfect for selfie lovers..Rear is also better than redmi note 8.4.Nightscape' better than redmi note 8.5.Best for long time gamers.Also there are some puny demerits....1.Buy a 11D SCREEN PROTECTOR as it is GOR-GLASS 3(they are more strong than gen-5 but less scratch resistant).2.No backcover inside the box.3.No macro lens.That's all guys hope you have read my review..

"
"

  This was my first samsung phone and i can tell you that i am pretty much impressed. Camera is good but battery life is excellent. Moreover it can play decent games really well. Screen quality of samsung is the undisputed champion and we all know that. Overall, im happy with this purchase.

"
"

  The phone is excellent. The camera is nice with many modes. It is fast. The biometrics (security  features) are also nice. The 6000 mah battery is more than enough. We didn't get a headphone with the box but they did not remove the headphone jack. Any way we can use old headphones. The charger is also good and the phone gets charged very fast. And there are many features like one handed mode, split screen,pop up  view,hand swipe for screenshot and many more.A very good phone

"
"

  Extremely  poor customer service. No use of warrnty issued by Samsung. It seems service centre are advised not to admit any warranty claim. minor issues such as scratch on screen is made as a reason for rejecting harware problems. No escalation mechanism is available.  Highest you can escalate is upto marketing executive . top managment is unreachable.  I will advise not to be deceived by configuration of phone. Running life is not more than 7-8 months and you cant expect warranty commitment to be honoured by Samsung.

  Finger print : 5 star which reads the finger fastCamera Quality : 4 star at first the quality looks good but after some time the night vission images are not that goodBattery Life : 1 star they said it is 6000 battery but it is not,the battery drain like the 4000 battery i brought the mobile by looking battery but i feel i have made the wrong decisionNotifications : 0 star, because when the screen is lock we don't get any notifications but after trying the 4 days i found the correct setting to on the notifications

  I'm writing this review after a week of use.Battery life - 8/10Processor- 7.5/10Screen quality 10/10Camera quality- 9/10Fingerprint scanner- 6.5/10Speaker- 8/10Microphone- 9/10UI- 9/10

"
"

  One of the best phone in this price range. Battery is massive. Camera is very good. Display is the best. Processor is good. Overall an excellent 'Non-Chinese' product. If the design, color & plastic would have been good then this would be the best phone in this range.

"
"

  This is a blockbuster of the existing mobiles available in the market with such great price.1. Camera is Superb with loads of features2. Design is candybar and from Top to bottom view.3. Touch is fabulous4. Battery life till now is looking great with almost 2 days of backup on moderate use.5. Above all, this is Made in India mobile..

"
"

  The phone has great features and should be priced a bit higher.But still for people like us who need to buy Samsung brand and be in budget, this phone is a ""wish fulfilled""!The heating issue is present but that depends on usage as well.As I am a moderate user, heating is less or not present in my case.Thanks to Amazon for replacing the product which was initially not of good quality.The replacement  product works perfect.

"
"

  Super phone.. seriously.. use only half the battery in a day still do all your regular tasks.. office, photography, social media, streams, transactions, etc.. easily.. in full brightness..awesome fullscreen shots, superb 16:9 pics, easy selfies, slow n super slows... n a lot more.. even in 4GB.. All just quietly....Yeah.. Sorry I don't play games with my phone.. so no comments on that.. but sure won't be a problem....BUT... but.. but... safety first... guards before you touch... insure before you take it out.. Enjoy

"
"

  The review after 1 month.  *  This phone have an excellent display,which  makes good video experiance.  *  battery life is good , the only con is the  charging time it requires (approx 2.40 hr)  *  the camera quality is also good , its quality is  best at day light , littile disappointed at night .  *  fingerprint sensor is not up to the mark.it  requires to wipe the sensor sometimes to read  the finger*  it is also good for games like pubg at normal use  (dont know about intensive play).the display  gives a wonderful experiences in gaming.

"
"

  All the three mentioned above things are awesome. And have never seen such a drastic change in Samsung. Only thing is the touch screen of the phone is a bit slow. U need to touch it twice rarely. Otherwise the phone is outstanding and performance wise is just perfect as per your budget.

"
"

  I thought the phone will be good, but it delighted me as SAMSUNG always does. The camera quality (48+12+5)MP and the inbuilt editing options are amazing for a mobile of this price category. The speed of the face recognition and fingerprint is supercool . Storage and RAM speed are spellbound. An awesome product at this price range. My only worry is that they didn't offer a screen guard or backcase with it. So I have to keep it more carefully is my only worryüòÜPS: I have attached the live focus images taken with low light area. Still it's awesome than real

"
"

  It's not simply worth Rs.14000, but when I purchased it , this was the only non-chinese device ( practically ).I knew it before I bought it that it is not the best phone in that price range, but my Dad advised me to go for it.I thought that it would have a extraordinary display, but the display was set to 720p amoled out of the box. Don't get me wrong display is good, you feel the difference specially if you have been using ips display. Camera is also not that great front and rear both. The only place it shines is only battery life and charging as well.

"
"

  This is my review after 1 month of usage. And writing my experience about this phone m21 6+128.1.Battery life is good2.Camera is good i wont say it awesome. It can click some good pictures. But in night it is horrible.3.heating is major issue in phone.sometime you cannot put phone in your ears. It can heat up while charging or during viode watching.4.screen quality is good.5. Speed wise it is good.but not awesome. Sometime it little bit flick. But for normal usage  it is good.4.

"
"

  Great display, Excellent Battery life, Rear Camera ok sort of, issues in video stabilizing, Touch is very responsive, charging takes quite a some time. Biggest disappointment is the selfie camera. Go for it for medium overall usage. For selfie lovers, dont even think of this.

"
"

  Finger print:- It is excellent  feature in this phone for safety and also it works properly.Battery Life: 6000mah, a huge battery life works for almost 1-2 days, depending upon you. How much you consume. But it looks almost 2.15hours to charge.Camera Quality:- both cameras are give  clear picture quality in day at outdoor locations. But in night still it lacks on clarity.Audio&Video Quality:- Amazing experience of both types of songs. Supports full hd videos.Looks;- For me this phone is having good looks ang it enhances your impressions in front of others.

"
"

  Edited: Phone's performance is completely overshadowed by its mic issues. Sadly my family own 3 of its kind and all behave the same. So no its not specific phone. I would not suggest any one to buys this.Earlier: Its a decent phone but lacks quality microphone. Specially when phone is not at the same level of face. This is big disappointment. Rest all is fine. Service was good.

"
"

  One major issue with this phone it does not support hotspot on your pc/laptop but connect with other phones u have to run net by using usb tathering, I contact samsung customer care, he says android 10Does not support windows 7,8 but support windows 10 I have not tried yetCamera avgBattery descentI am not recommend this phone

"
"

  Pros:  Long lasting battery backup  Good camera quality  Classy look  Smooth running processor  Split screen functionality for multitaskers  Great network connectivityCons:  Fingerprints is not detecting sometimes  Got dust stuck in my camera just after 1 months ofpurchase  Night mode is not available for screen to work with mobile in night

"
"

  I am writing this review after 1 week of usage. This is the best phone in this range which is NOT CHINEESE. Let me tell it's pros and cons. PROS 1st the display is outstanding. Battery is really a monster very long battery life. The traditional finger print sensor is very fast. Performance is also smooth and good. CONS it's a excellent phone overall but it lacks in selfie camera only. Night selfies lack behind only. Rear cameras r beasts excellent.If u r looking for 6 GB ram then don't go with it. Then I may take M31. Every thing is same only camera difference.

"
"

  to much disapointed by samsung and as well as amazon for missinformaton regarding otg 1st talk about demarits of M21 otg not working it is big problem for me , battery not charging fast just for selling named 15watts charger it's took more than 3hrs, no knox security given in m21, chip quality of plastic used so thait phone always attractive with dity partical hole day lossing time to clean phone,  camera overoll good, battery just for name 6000mha its just for 24hrs onlyi used samsung j5 and a30 these two phone is too good so that i buy m21 its disapointed mefinally do not buy this

"
"

  I bought this mobile for my dad in june, and he uses it regularly for calls whatsapp and some YouTube everyday and carries it either in shirt pocket or Jean's pocket.This kind of patch started with a small dot and then started spreading to the whole screen , when checked with local samsung service center they told that they are receiving a lot of display patches complaints and warranty is not covered in itDisappointed to hear this kind of answer and to get it repaired it costs 5,500 and i purchased mobile for 12,500

"
"

  I found this phone to be on very good side regarding screen, battery and UI. See if u r not a hardcore gamer, then go for this because this is on par with Realme 6 and MI except the processor. After new updates Realme phones seems to be lagging much.Camera quality is also very good in daylight. No overheating issues, but charging rate is bit slow.

"
"

  It just awsome iam purchased my m21 3 weeks ago.i have no words about this phone .its is superb and awsome.it is 100% worth for value of moneyIt has 6000 mah battery and u must get 1 day fully if u are using continuously other wise 2 or 3day batter lifeAnothe one is its display ‚ù£ it has fhd display many other phones have no fhd display in this price range  It has super camera quality.there are many modes in camera like pro ,slowmotion,etc and uts has super camera  Finger print reader is so good.i love it‚ù£ü§©and iam suggesting  every body to purchase this phone.............

  It's been a month of usage and i feel, that was a terrific deal. One of the best smart phones in this range. Multi tasking is as fast as one would want a phone to be. Camera clarity is mind blowing and the slowmo feature is a plus for 'josh' lovers.Clearly and evidently a Good buy...

"
"

  This phone packs great deal of value yet keeping the cost low, truly breaking the myth that expensive is always better.. The display on this phone has the potential to compete with 30K+ category phones. After days of confusion due to tons of options available at this price range, I‚Äôm glad that I made the right decision in the end.

"

  6 gb var√≠ent u should buy. Though 4 gb works fine for me.Pros.Superb battery.Nice display.Camera OK for this price.ConsFingerprint sensor could be much better.Struggle to focus on object. It takes bit time

"

  Worst product i ever purchase in my life ..When i insert the sim card it is showing emergency calls only than i make i req to replace this item and on delivery time corrier boy says that the IMEI no of that Handest is deffer rather that Handset deliver to you than i make lots of calls on Amazone custmore care but i did not got any resolution yet"" Even call Executives make me hold for 63 Minuts thrice in a day"" So worst product and worst Amazone service and if i will not got any solution by today than i am going to file a case in Consumer Form against Amazon.com

  I was brought this phone having a big issu with Network problem .Where other company mibile having full network and good internating work  but this phon having varry less network and poor internate workingI was try to replace my phon or refund but amezon call service executive says that sorry sir i have no replace or refund plan i having a recording of conversation of callI am varry disappointed no one was help me even Amazon serviceI advice to every one dont buy any product with AmazonI previously buyed many product with this but never buy again with Amazonüòëüòûüòíüò†üò°

  It 6000mah but feels like a 4000mah battery.Its not fast charging. Battery drains a little fast. Speakers sounds gets a little distorted at full volume.The microsd port is physically defective in this particular piece but i decided not to return the product since the mic in my other phone got damaged and i needed a phone urgently. Overall a good phone  for moderate usage.

"
"

  1. Cost cutting is apparent in phone body, plasticy material.2. No earphones, screengaurd or phone cover with.3. The screen appear scratched in a month, with normal home use by mom, gorilla glass shouldn't be this easily scratched. Seems manufacturing defect. However can't visit svc due to covid.4. Lacks many software features of its siblings that could be given.All in all, you get what you pay for.I would've still given a better rating if not for that scratch.

  Hi, the touch screen of my new M21 phone is not working from last 4 days. I was waiting to phone to switch off automatically and yesterday I put my phone on charging again and still facing the same problem. I received my phone on 24/08/2020 and it's just 12 days passed today on 04.09.2020 and I am facing this problem. seriously I am very disappointed with this device . I had never expected this from Samsung. worse experience ever.  Let me know how can i claim the refund.

"
"

  Value for money.those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 4gb ram,64 GB internal storage and super Amoled display one can bemore satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones since starting. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.battery 6000 mah is awaosme till date of 1 month usage.1.5 days long lasting without gaming but all normal work.As far as a non gaming is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

"
"

  The only thing i did not like is that the charger came with it is of only 15W while keeping in mind of 6000 mah battery it should be 25W or 30W it takes 2¬Ω hour to charge from 0 to 100.Also Samsung should adopt giving Snapdragon Processor rather than its low performance and cheap processor which is exynos.

"
"

  This mobile is good in this price range from samsung. Good perfomence after 1 month usage. Battary is 6000mah,but thats much perfomence is not there, will get 1 day charge in an average user. Telling fast charging but it will take more than 2.5 hours for full charge. Camara perfomence is good but for videos focus issue is there. Face lock will not work properly in poor lights.

"
"

  The M21 galaxy phone is a marvellous addition in your palms, great value for the price with remarkable cutting edge technology that is truly the hallmark of Samsung.The telltale signs are really there with the seamless interface and a gargantuan battery that lasts and lasts!The camera features are classic and lives up to the expectations of its name wattacamera!!The display is exceptional and the gaming feel is an added perk.WattaMonster is the best bounce for the buck!!!

"
"

  M21Beast battery. Only one time charge required in 24hrs with good use. Full charging in 2.5 hrs.Charging wire is short.Very good front and back camera. And super amoled display adds to it.Back look is not as flashy as it looks in image.Phone design is not sleek when compared to others.Not for heavy gaming.Exchange offer makes it budget friendly.Overall a better phone under 14000 as compared to others.Hanging and heating is minimally seen.

"
"

  After seraching for the specs in that 15k range I selected this one as this one has the best specs. I am not a big fan of mi or real or xiomi. Apart from ios this is the 2nd Android I am using. My last moto g6 was good but didnot last long because of speakers problem. As this can be successor of m30s which has very good review, I opt for this mobile. Camera quality and built quality is awesome. Pretty fast. Altogether I am loving it.

"
"

  This is really a monster. Awesome 6000(5850) mAh battery which last upto 2 days with normal usage.Best sAmoled display. I bet you will never switch to any IPS LCD display after using any amoled display.It also comes with fantastic Camera. And also it is manufactured in INDIA. What else is needed in a Budget smartphone. Highly recommend to buyüòÑ

"
"

  I was looking for a budget friendly phone, and I am a old customer of Samsung, so I bought M21Pros1. Nice processor, can play PUBG smoothly even in T3 or T2 customs( some lag in T2)2. Awesome camera, 48 MP is really niceCons-1. Sometimes heat while charging if the fan or AC is off.2. According to me, no cons other than this.Go for it Blindly!!!

"

  Battery is awesome 5/5Camera is quite decent does it job 3.5/5Display is fantastic 5/5Samsung should Manufacture in India No TPU case or Temper glassNeed to buy individuallyM21 with Jio is best!Turn off Mobile data and WiFiNow call to another Jio person get video call on VOLte Without mobile data and WiFi

"
"

  Samsung M21 is quite good. Battery life is awesome, touch is also good. But the bad thing about this product is its built quality is very weak or In other words its FRAGILE. Phone display is very delicate, it breaks easily if it fells down from hand mistakenly and original display price is 5400 INR from ASC. Apart from being fragile, overall phone is good, you can play games,camera quality is up to the mark & u can easily do your normal tasks with multiple tabs. I hope it helps.Good luck.

"

  I bought 6GB RAM, 128GB storage midnight blue colour mobile. As name says, it's a 'monster' in budget mobiles segment. Impressive battery of 6000 mah and good cameras. Nice fingerprint sensor. Voice output during audio/video is good, but could have been bit better. Fast charging is another plus point. Totally it's worth buying.

"
"

  If you are looking best display (sAmoled) phone under 14k and a non Chinese product, it's blind option for you. What I have noticed is battery is good 6k mah, that's more than enough for a day or 2 days. For gamers it's a difficult choice because of exynos9611 processor, I am not saying it's not that powerful. It's a bit older processor. Display is awesome no doubt. For one who watches movies or web series like me it's a best choice. Camera is good at this price (14k). Samsung service is good.

"
"

  I need to replace the piece I received yesterday there is some problems in the device .There are problems and issues with the camera as well as the internal colours. The colours showing on the screen is very much dim. The photos clicked though this device seems very dim and the colour of the photos are so dull that the photos seems yuk.I never expected this type of device may received from your well known company.Hope you will help replacing the device or send the money back.Need to replace m21 mobile which I received and I am very  unsatisfied with the thing I received.

"
"

  I bought it for my wife and the phone Overall performance is good. For a better performance like playing a high-end game, I suggest 6GB-128GB variant is better.My review after a week useDisplay - Good 5*Camera - Average 4* ( Photo has avg quality)Camera On video call - Good 5* (Perfect clarity on a video call)Battery -  5* (Last 24hrs easily even regular use )Performance - 5* (No lag or hang )

"
"

  This phone is awesome. No issues, and less heating while playing games. I tried all games with higher graphics it was running smoothly with less heating that occurs normally. Coming to the display it has an wonderful amoled display, everything that we see through this is awesome. Best for video and games content.Battery was good and decent,multitasking was awesome. I didn't find any lag while switching between apps.Camera quality is good in backcam, good natural shots.Best all-rounder phone which can satisfy every needs.

"
"

  Picked this up for interim use and it solves the purpose.Battery is good and the rear camera is stunning under lights. Fingerprint scanner is not as quick as expected.Haven't used it for gaming yet, so no comments on that.

  Display is amazing‚ù§Ô∏è (best than redmi note series and Oppovivo phones)front camera is Best in this price range. (Best than Redmi note 9 pro and Poco m2 pro.)First i was thinking to buy redmi note 9 pro but due to flash sale issues i switched to this phone & I am truely Satisfied by Samsung M21.Light weight and slim phone.So many options for rare camera. Video shooting quality is impressive‚ù§Ô∏èIf you are xiaomi oppo vivo honor users and now thinking to switch in SAMSUNG then do not hesitate. Just Go for It..üëçüëç

"

  I bought this phone after reading good reviews but it disappointed me completely when I actually started using it. Not even a month and the touch screen of the phone started giving issues and now is not working completely. Went to samsung service center here is lucknow and they said they still haven't received the touch screen display part for it since this was sold only online. The amazon seller for this phone has disabled the support option here so I cannot get any support here as well. Utterly disappointed with the seller and amazon for this purchase.

"
"

  Here's a üíØ true review,  I have used it a lot, if battery is your biggest concern then this is one of the best in this range.It charges very quickly, I mean in 25 minutes it charged 17-18%, and every percent lasts long. But the camera is not quite satisfactory, the front camera makes your photos a bit redish, but the slow motions are really good!! But still it's good.The phone thus heats but very less..so doesn't matter, the speakers are loud and good. The phone is smooth. So you must definitely go for it. It supports Microsoft office.

"
"

  5th day of use...Phone has heating issues, its literally burns your ears..Battery life is poor, it shows 6000Mah but works for 3-4 hours and battery drains I've put in charging every now and then...Fast charging is not working. It takes 3-4 hours to get 100% charge.Internet is very very poor.. phone requires restart every after 15-20 mins..Unlike my old phone still better in performance.. I was told that my phone will be replaced but Amazon Customer service is just fooling around..ended up loosing money and timeNOT WORTH, NOT Recommended

"
"

  i really like the samsung m21before purchasing i was worried abouth this i was confused between redmni note 9ro or samsung m21. but trust me samsung prove that m21 is the best mobile its dispay super,amoled is top class quality. and its a dolby support in earphonesyou will enojoy the next level of sound compare to other brand. persanly i like it very very much. i suggest you dont buy other brand like redmi or realme. before purchasing this mobile i use redmi note 5.

"
"

  Product started to hang just day after return widow closed ....Gifted the phone to my sister and 14 k not o ly gone waste but also embarrassing really shameful to samsung and amazon.Shame to  samsung and amazon though I am  frequent user and customer redmi and flipkart were far better.May be amazon is only platform for selling but they have to  ensure quality also.Never expected from Samsung I had heard they make quality product and customer centric.We had no time to go around service center for new product.Really shameful.

"
"

  The phone serves its purpose, battery life is really good, samsung compormised it on processor but it makes up for that by maximising the usage of processor during gaming. Camera quality is really good and its screen, you can fall in love with that screen.

"
"

  Battery is superb....but with battery of 6000mah overheating is prominent.......... display is just nostelgic and feels like heaven...... spekers are nice but not loud as needed..... plastic body is there with nice finish.......screen is average.....camera quality is good but not as good as it should be they need to improve that.... they need to work on fingerprint sensor too........that is not quick as it should beoverall pros- battery and display cons- overheating and camera quality and fingerprint sensor

"
"

  OK the phone is not for gamers , but there are people other than gamers and these phone is for them, the battery life is superb the interface is not crappy, the samsung one UI is bwtter than any other UI on the market other than Stock android and Oxygen os.The looks are Ok but you are going to buy a case or cover everyone does so that is not an issue, the phone can multitask and that is all what you need, the camera i can't  tell you about it because i am not an expert and i don't  use it that often. Overall the phone is excellent than others for me.

"
"

  Mobile is Great value this prize, but some problem in mobile is Data Network some iss.The Internet gets worse maximum times. I have used the same sim that I used before but after using in this phones it receives 2G network maximum times and not 4G its happening only with this phoneAccessories - USB Cable is very ShortI Suggest to your big Brand Samsung CompanySamsung is big Brand in world but some time very parsimonious in produc Handsets, Back case.. etcMy Opinion is that Samsung Company further about this Give a good production now because the public does not want to take the product of China..

"
"

  This is my first Samsung smartphone.i have been using it for almost two months now.for everyday use this phone is perfect and 6000mah battery is a bonus.i like games and i played call of duty,real racing etc... and it worked  fine.M21's biggest  plus point is its display and  i fell in love with it the moment  the screen turned  on.Audio  gets a boost with Dolby  atmos.one thing i felt this phone lagged was a faster charger.current one is 15W charger and takes more than 2hrs for 0-100% charge.

"
"

  Actually it is a very good smartphone but it has many many bugs in there which can be fixed by software update...such as when i play a recorded video....the video quality comes fine but the issue comes in the sound that this phone cant capture properly....i think there is a issue in microphone or something....it cant record sound properly even after u are close enough to the phone.....the recorded cant record sound properly...it record sound very badly..and it does not come with any app lock....many basic feature like this doesnt come in this phone.

"
"

  This is a pretty decent phone in this budget. After Credit Card discount was able to get it for 12500. The phone was in high demand so delivery took 5 days.Coming to the phone it has good looks, Camera quality is decent, battery back up is awesome. If you are not looking for a gaming phone than this phone is going to meet all your expectations in this budget.Plus it is Made In India product.

"
"

  Best budget phone.... Strongly recommended phone.The best to choose Samsung M21 among the all available choices in this range. I am using it for the past 3 days and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.I strongly recommend this phone for purchasing. Samsung M21 is the best value for money in India. I am full satisfied with the purchase of this phone.Thank You Samsung & Amazon for your wonderful product & Delivery.

"
"

  The screen of the phone stopped working. Went to service centre. They refused to repair it . They are charging 4100/- to repair. It's not our fault. The piece is defective. Please help us in returning the mobile and refund the money

"
"

  I'm using this phone for the past 2 months . The phone works awesome. Great battery life,great amoled display,  and i played all games including pubg with this mobile ,It performs well ....thank you samsung for the mobile,thank you Amazon for deliver this product on time,even during this pandemic situation...camera quality is very good in terms of daylight condition. It produces natural images and 20 mp front camera produces natural skintoned bright images, finger print reader is decent enough  to unlock ..I hadn't facing any issues with it. Slim amoled samsung product must buy at this segment.

"
"

  Great phone with good battery life but charging speed is bery bad.It will take at least 2.5 hrs to full charge.Camera is awesomeFingerprint response is good but not best.Display quality is amazing.Phone speed is normal but not for heavy gamers.OS very user friendly.Till now NO hanging problem.

"
"

  Excellent device according to my usage. I am not a gamer just use mobile for watching movies, calling . For watching media mobile having superamoled full hd screen and its quality os amazing. It has 6000 mAh battery which me for a full day in just 80 % percent charging but it takes around 1:30 hr for charging 75-80% and 2:30 hr for full charge but it is not problem for me. Its ui is also good from other custom skin. If your usage matches from me you have to look for this option it is worth .

"
"

  I have been using this phone for 3 months now and it turned out to be a good deal overall.Pros:1. One of the best displays without any doubt at this price .2. Battery life is good , usually lasts for a day with moderate usage3. One UI,  so a clean stock experience with no ads or bloatware.4. Manufactured in India , so do keep this point in mind.Cons:1.  Fast charger isn't fast enough . It would take around 2.5 to 3 hours to fully charge the phone.2. Not that great for gaming when compared with other smartphones in this price cap.

"
"

  Phn is really good at this price point. Display, Cam, Battery is awsome. No lag or software issue. Only problems I noticed is about auto brightness sensor. Its auto brightness works with front cam. But its not ok. But if we use manually no problem with that. Still samsung need to fix it in upcoming phones. These are basic sensors which seen in even 5k budget phns. But this phone is value for money and best in this price segment. ‚ù§ Samsung..

"
"

  The best phone anyone can buy in this price. Best screen and battery. Camera quality is good. Fingerprint reader is fast and responsive. Bt figures have to be clean. Can even play pubg in hd and smooth with no problem at all with even with the 4gb variant. Just use a back cover. Screen is gorilla glass 3 so scratches can be avoided if cared a bit.

"
"

  Bought this for my mom.Camera quality of both front and back camera is good. Screen works great.Battery life is as expected.Fingerprint reader seems to have some minor issues. Since it isn't round, it doesn't seem to read from all angles.Processor is excellent at this price point.

"
"

  A very nice model Samsung M21 from Samsung India. I have chosen this model among other models with similar specifications but others were not trustworthy. The camera quality, battery life, usage and handling, finger print reader and security feature are nice. Finger print sensor taken some time to recognize for 2 to 3 days use. Later it is smoothly working. Battery is mindblowing n can be used for 1.5 days on single full charge. Camera is also best. Sturdy 180 gms, handling is not a problem.

"
"

  There is nothing as yet which I dislike in this product. Battery life is fantastic, I don't need to run around with a charger or power bank like before.The finger print reader is quick to unlock phone. I have captured some of the best images on this phone and I can clearly compare the variance from my previously taken snaps. Love this phone, go for it.

"
"

  Awesome phone for this price.Pros:1. Super AMOLED display 5/5.2. Camera 4/5.3. Battery 5/5 (approx 2 days).4. Light weight.5. Looks premium.Cons:Little laggy processor.Overall value for money phone.

"
"

  Got the phone a week back, initially it started hanging a bit, I did not pay attention thought it would go away with time.Then slowly with use I noticed- It heated badly during charging- started hanging even more frequently- The focus on the camera was not working- fingerprint scanner took a couple of triesI have been using samsung since ages and have never been so disappointed. Have requested for a replacement. Let's see if that's any better or gives the same performance.

"
"

  Samsung galaxy M21 very nice productFinger print reader is sensitive & secure quick access.Battery life excellent one more than 24 hours I can see the live videos battery backup superb.Camera quality very nice clarity photos & options also good.Display is very very superb & watching live as real near to me.Touch experience is awesome I never feel at another mobile.Sound also very good.Samsung galaxy M21 is superb & awesome brand mobile I can say in less amount huge features available in mobile

"
"

  Well front glass quality is ridiculously poor. It broked with just a little impact with 3.5mm jack. And Samsung won't even replace it even under warranty. And when asked customer service they said ""You should have used screen protector"", if so then you should one in box and state in specifications that M21 screen is of poor quality.And battery life is also around 4500-5000 mAh, and still takes 2¬Ωhrs to charge.

"
"

  I bought a mobile phone ( samsung M21) nd i am not happy to buy a product from you..there is lots of technical issues in this mobile set. Firstly networking problem -net is not working properly nd its network is very slow in comparison of other mobiles and secondly battery problem-It has 6000 mh battery but it gets dead too soon .I did not get to see anything special in this product as I thought. Pls replace it as soon as possible otherwise i will not buy anything online from your plateform humble request to u replace it with better performance if it works well i will give u positive feedback..

"
"

  This phone is awesome I'm enjoying it using and the battery life of this phone is just mindblowing it gives me approximate 10hrs of screenontime and it's also take 3.30 hrs to charge it completely. The fingerprint reader is blazing fast and the camera quality is awesome it's excellent phone you can go with it and also forget about to mention display it's best display under 15-20k its superamoled deep blacks and contrasty colours.......Gaming performance is good but not the best.

"
"

  Amazing phone by Samsung. A very great device at a nice price. I would have surely rated it above 5stars if it was possible.The battery is literally a monster.. I have used this phone from 95% - 20% for 48 hours. The camera is awesome and biometrics are quicker then thought of.Overall.... A must buy option if you are looking for a new beasttt.....Cheers!!!!

"
"

  It's a good good product manufactured in  Indian . After log time Samsung launch a good looking cool product.It's a worth of money to buy it.I am giving 4star bcoz Charing is not fast as they are claiming.Camera is good, in low light good images can be captured.Processor is fast enough for most of heavy application.It's a bit heavier in weight.But stronger than mi and other. As Samsung usually take care . Thanks for design engineer of Samsung to provide a quality product with budget friendly.I strongly recommend it.

"
"

  I am using this phone nearly for 3 weeks and it is really a monster interms of battery life. The screen quality is top notch and the camera has punchy colors that please your eyes.  One of the major factors to buy this device is bloatware free os experience in one ui. I really love this phone and I will recommend  everyone to go for this phone who is looking  for smooth secure haslet free mobile experience  and moderate amount of gaming and a good brand value.

"

  Thanks to samsung and amazon. recently i purchased samsung m21 on amazon it was very impressive battery life (6000mah) and 15w fast charging 15w fast charger contain with the box and very good cameras on day light but it despointed me on low light and execlent display (super amoled) 6.4 inch and it's supported for super slow motion slow motion recordings and video stablization is  good rear 48 mp cam pics are awesome and this device supports to dolby atmos  sound it's super sounding experience simply this mobile is value for money very budget friendly.awesome processor.Sincere Thanks to Samsung

"
"

  Pros: Screen, Battery , Camera, Average speaker, Fast face unlock.Cons: Processing speed( outdated processor), Poor UI (highly customize Android), Build quality (Cheap plastic) and Most important I.e Slow internet speed.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is really amazing phone at this price.i bought this phone on end of June and till yet everything is fine. fingerprint sensors are very fast and I mostly use face recognition and that's also have fast response. And the camera quality is too good.Also the front camera 20MP gives you best selfie as well as best clarity during video call. I really liked this phone. And the battery life is too good i.e I charge only once a day and it gives good battery backup as it discharges after more than one day completion even after using too much.so I recommend you to buy this phone.

  I've been using this phone for 4 months now.Here's what I found out.Cons:The fingerprint sensor has almost stopped working now.The phone is a little heavier than other phones of the same size.The camera isn't upto the markPros:The battery life is pretty good. I mean its 6000mah after all.The phone doesn't lag. The interface is pretty smooth.That's pretty much it.I only bought it cuz I didn't want a Chinese phone. All in all pretty average quality phone.

  Good phone at a very good price point. Display is amazing and crisp. Battery is super, Camera quality is far better than the competition at this price point. Overall a great purchase for me at this price and Trust of Samsung is also there.üôÇ

  Camera - 7.5/10(Low light camera not good at all)(10min limit on UHD recording)Battery - 10/10Charging - 6/10(It will take around 2:30 hours to charge due to 15W charger)Performance - 9/10 (6GB RAM,128GB Storage)Design - 10/10(Very comfortable,thin and light weight with curved corners and minimum bezels)If you want better camera with same 6000MAH battery, please go for Samsung Galaxy M31.If you want fast charging with little less battery please go with Realme or Xioami.

"
"

  It says fast charging in product description but charging is actually slow. It takes more than 3 hours to completely charge 6000 Mah battery. It should not take more than 1 hour to charge 6000 Mah battery. Xiaomi and realme phones offer much faster charging of 33 Watt in same price range. Samsung offers just 15 watt charging. Also we can't use samsung phone like a TV remote which Xiaomi phones offer.

  Phone is getting heated within 2sec while am downloading basic apps like what's app, share it etc... I didn't expect such a worst product from a branded company, totally disappointed the phone is getting heated only at the top most point between camera and fingerprint sensor am really felt bad this is my first time am returning the product that I have got from Amazon

"
"

  Excellent device,  go for it blindly.Pros:1. Awesome SAmoled display2. Excellent battery life3. Exynos 9611 perfect processor for gaming4. 6GB/128GB @ low price5. 20mp Selfie Camara6. Samsung beautiful UI7. Excellent auto brightness8. Amazon perfect delivery9. Low priceEtc., etc.,Cons;1. Rear camera isn't great while zooming2. Slightly heating under high usage3. No screen guard or back cover along with box...Over all excellent device from Samsung @ this price point.

"
"

  The phone is super awesome. After using Mi phones for more than 3 years, I switched back to Samsung and found my decision absolutely right. The battery marker comes to around 50% after heavy usage of phone for almost a day. Fast charging adds to the comfort. Camera, performance, display every thing is just superb.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader detect it's within seconds it's very fast.battery life is the one of the most fantastic, mind-blowing thing in it 6000mah it lasts for 2 days, there is no need to have tension about battery, it has 48mp backcamara which triple camra and selfie cam of 20mp.u can see a great different in the screen if u use or phone without amoled screen and if u see this phones screen display u will be surprised because of the Colour difference and picture quality.its a great phone under the rang of price.

  I was so confused whether to buy m21 or any other models but I trust Samsung the most. I bought the 6gb 128 gb variant. Those who have confusion with m21 and m31 I suggest you should buy m21 if you not really interested in the camera. Rest of the features are same for both. The M21 has a lot of customization features that are not mentioned on description. They make the phone more friendly and you will love it. In my opinion, it's the best smartphone with 16000 rs. price. I love it

"
"

  Its been a great  experience with Samsung's M21 .I like its design what a stylish look.Its megamonstor battery üîã wow it has superb battery lifetime i am using 1 and a half day such a long time isn't it ?.Its fingerprint reader is great as soon as you put your finger it immediately unlock phone wow.Camera üì∑ its a most liked part of mine specially last update of single take.And what a superb processor it has .And it comes up in Midrange I love it.So its truly.... truly.... called as ""Mega Monster üëπ ""

"
"

  Definitely  , this is the best smartphone of Samsung brand. Its Display impresses everyone a lot . The battery of the phone is like a cherry on the top! Samsung's all time favourite Exynos 9611 Processor also provides an uninterrupted performance.  The 48 MP Camera captures seemingly fantastic shots . Overall , this phone makes its owner fall in love with itself . Besides, being a masterpiece in an affordable cost of Rs. 14000 , this phone also breaks the misconceptions made by the people about Samsung that the brand provides less feature Smartphone in an dissatisfying price.

"
"

  The best phone under 15000.......no issue.......smooth ui(one ui 2.0 with android 10)......Only one problem is it has a polycarbonate body and gets scratches easily.....but you can apply skin or back cover to prevent it from scratches........no problem at allü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©...i boughtthis phone for my mom ,My mom loved the phone........Better than mi phones as they have plenty of ads.....some bloatware is there but you can uninstall it.....except Facebook and Netflix.....best combo is 4/64 GB variant....if you have 1000 more you can go with the Samsung A21s......

"
"

  The overall performance of m21 is nice but while coming to the battery life it didn't met my expectations as it mentioned as a 6000 mah it doesn't look like that , the video experience on the device is good, I have used redmi note 7 pro which has 4300 mah which has a better power efficiency than this 6000 mah device , may be the amoled display on the m21 is the factor as the amoled is bright it needs power for maintaining its bright display other than that the phone becomes a very good option for the average or casual gamer and it will be a quick recommendation for parents. Thank You

  Phone's battery life is good. Camera is not good as expected. Need to be improved camera quality specially of front camera. I bought this phone in mid June 2020. There many problems like phone restart randomly and freeze many times in day and Bluetooth issue. So I reset the phone, restart problem resolve but other problems are same as earlier. When I received July patch update then my all problem resolved but camera quality is not resolved. Take pic from front camera. It is not good. Otherwise phone's build quality and phone design is awesome. I give this phone 4 stars. ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

"
"

  Mobile network signal is very poor. Hotspot & Wi-fi are not working properly. During call internet connectivity is lost. 3 times call to customer care but they are not able to resolve it. If I do hotspot then network speed is very poor for laptop / other mobile device.  Camera quality is also average. Within 1 month there are many black stains are in back side of the phone. Over all this phone is not up to the mark.

"
"

  So after almost 1.5 months using this device I am writing this review. First of all the camera quality is awesome if some one wants a mobile with a good camera go for it. Second the battery backup is unbeatable during this period of online classes and all it runs easily for a day after 100% of you operate less it can give a backup uptob1.5 to 2 days. Samoled screen display again awesome, design is good.Overall an excellent product at this price must go for it without any doubt. Highly recommended.

"
"

  It is a 'saying' that, ""First impression is the last impression.""It happened with me. Once in my childhood my neighbor bought one of samsung phone and nearly after 3 or 4 months that phone starts hanging. After that the impression of Samsung company on me was worse. But, now I have bought this phone after seeing its battery, display and ram and ofcourse its clock speed and processor I become the fan of this company and especially of this phone.It impressed me very much and the above idiom became wrong for me.And if you're going to buy any phone,Then I, personally recommend you to buy this incredible mobile.ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥

"
"

  Got this product for a better deal and am happy with the product. Good battery life, sleek design, better config for this price range.Cons - Problem reading finger print and camera quality is not that great, phone lags when used for longer hours.Overall better product under the price range and as I have been using Samsung quite some time felt that the service provided by them is ok. This is my individual opinion so do your research when you want to buy a mobile

"
"

  Samsung m21 after using i get very bad experiance the fingerprint sensor is worst performing and face lock sensor also performing worst if i type little bit fast so its get hanged and  i dont know why i purchase this product. just because of brand value i purchase. and i feel cawn with brand and i feel very bad because of this was my first product of samsung before this i always other branded phone but this samsung product worst even i asked to customer care of amazon to please return this product but they told me in case your product damage than we will change so i am feeling very helpless üòîüòî

"
"

  Phone is one the best price and performance.But my phone is founded defective, Touch Is not Working Properly Bug Created Some time in youtube and Back buttons Issue.Please Fix it Samsung through Software updates, Currently Amazon Give Me Replacement of my Phone thanks Amazon.But Samsung Fix this issue . REMOVE Samsung inbuilt apps also.But know my replacement phone is going well in all expect touchscreen is really smooth.

"
"

  Best samsung mobile in budjet price range..Camera is nice, selfi is amaizing portraits is good..Battery charging time is large (2.30h) it stands for 2 to 3 days..But there is some heating problem whill charging and continous usage...Fingerprints much faster than face unlock...Many of samsung appps are installed before using it....I am saying that the best phone of samsung in this price range...The main problem is no headphone and case in this box...The mobile is smoth and nohanging till my review...I really like it.......

"
"

  I am writing this review after 2 months of using this device. Main USP of this mobile is its battery. MASSIVE 6000 MAH battery gives you minimum 2 days mobile life without charging. Voice is loud and clear during conversation. It support FM. Camera quality is very good. Only thing is the back panel should be more attractive. Overall Samsung after a long time brought a budget phone with  very good configuration. I surely recommend this phone who have budget range of 15000 to 16000.

"
"

  Value for money if you go with this mobile.I am not a gamer. So can't say about the gaming performance. But for those who are buying it for normal usage, this phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.

"
"

  This mobile is really based on title...monster...The mobile battery life much better than the other mobiles,If we talk about camera quality..... so I can compare with any mobile to this....no one can beat this product.Talk about fingerprint or security then 5 out of 5 stars i give to it.Whole and sole this mobile is much better  in the comparison of other mobile phones. And who is not playing games....this is the best choice for you.Thanks for amazon

"
"

  This is one of my Legendary products bought in Amazon with exclusive Prime. I got it today. Here are what I observed from this product. Heating is the only issue and it also solved with leather case. I have bought 6GB RAM and 128 GB variants.This is a great product. I hope this phone's size is too long in height and gaming experience is still not touched by me. Anyhow a trustworthy product by me. It won't cheat you.

"
"

  The phone  quality is vary bad. I had purchased it. The phone is not turning on after the charge drained. The service center people saying that the board is complaint and will charge 4500 rs+service cost .for it. So SAMSUNG should seriously need to rethink on its product quality.Very poor quality...Battery lasting also poor.

"
"

  I like the device. I'm writing this review after one month of usageCamera Quality is greatBattery life is awesome, decent charging speedNo hanging problemOne con I found was adaptive brightness not working great, sometimes it can't adjust according to light outside

"
"

  Excellent battery life . sAmoled display is also satisfactory.The most affordable at this price with specs Samsung offering.A little lighter compared to Samsung m31. Vowifi works to perfection and Dolby atoms support is a charm to hear music.Processor Exynos9611 is no way inferior to the latest processors available.Fingerprint and face unlock working fine.Though 5 G not supported as it will take a long time for implementation fully satisfied Samsung Bingo

"
"

  The Device is good but it can be better in some features.1. Battery backup is not as expected.The battery is 6000 mah but it is working like 5000 mah. If you are a ASUS user then it's battery will not satisfy you.2.Camera quality is very good. But selfie is not so glamorous.3.Heating issue is very much disturbing. Not only during charging but also while using internet the device heat very much.4. Processor is good but I faced some lag problem sometimes.5. Not so good at gaming .Overall rating 3.5

"
"

  It's hardly a week since I purchased the phone and it's already lagging when I play games in spite of having 6gb Ram and ""good"" processor. One might get a better phone for the same cost.Recommendation for all the buyers:Don't blindly buy the phone without reading these honest reviews. This phone is not optimized properly and it lags. I want to return this phone, unfortunately, there's no return, which is a huge down side. Support for it is also so bad that I did not get any help and eventually I'm trapped. Beware.

"
"

  An awesome phone at such a low price.Battery Performance :-The device have a outstanding battery performance which last for a long duration.Also it get charged instantly with its speed charger.Camera:-The pics are just like HD . 48 MP camera is a key feature of the phone.And selfies are good too.Gaming:-Awesome for playing Pubg and other games. no heating of device nor the lagging can be seen.Play for a long time uninterruptedly.Must go for it without any doubt.It will provide many more features.

"
"

  I'm happy with Samsung M21 even i buy it at Rs.13999.This phone have 48 mp real camera which take awesome picture and it has 20 mp front camera and i think that's amazing for selfilovers .I have been able to run my phone's battery for about 12 hours on normal use. And the best part is that it only takes me two and a half hours to charge it. But its back panel is not very interesting. You may get a lot of scratch backwards. Everything else is good.

"
"

  The Samsung Galaxy M21 is simply an awesome phone that deserves all the praise it gets.Pros- Camera, Display, Battery, Build Quality(Despite having a plastic back)Cons- Location of the speaker, Samsung bloatwareOVERALL - Go for it blindly if you want a budget phone with a great camera, outstanding battery life, and an amazing display. Also, the black variant feels premium to the touch.P.S - Keep in mind though that this was made for an average consumer and not heavy gamers. However, it can pull off any game you through at it with ease.

  Being as a samsung customer now I feel samsung has cheated me. I used only 10 days and touch was not working. When I visited customer service they asked to change touch because mobile felt into water. I haven't idea üòÄüòÄ when it happened, it's used single hand. Now samsung also started sending their reject product and customer service coasting charge bear by customer. I purchased it at Rs 13999 and now changing coasting of touch is Rs 6200. Really it's very panic and feeling completely some one has cheated me.

"
"

  I am writing review after using it 3 days.. actually I wanted to buy a good mobile phone with a limited budget.. frankly speaking.. I wanted to buy redmi note 9 pro.. suddenly I got this one on Amazon.. and I took final decision to buy Samsung Galaxy M21.. I think this is the best choice for your budget phone..  in one word it is just some.. Everything is perfect like 6000mAH battery, camera , processor and performance .. please do not hesitate just go for it.. I am loving it..

"
"

  Please  don't buy .I have purchased  6GB ram and 128rom due to amelood  screen and battery.before this Samsung  I was using mi product.trust me MI products  are far better  than Samsung. Just because  of current  seniario  I thought  we should  leave chininese products. But I'm regretting MI features  and mobile are far better.dont watch you tube channel for mobile selection all are making us fool there is minor differences  between  amoled and ips full HD screen. And avoid  Amazon  shopping  flipkart is good for electronics  and mobile  purchases. Customers supp won't help

"
"

  Over all it's so good and handyIt's super amoled screen and long life 6000mah battery performance is highlight in this SAMSUNG M21.And it's camera performance is also so good.If ur budget is 13000 this the best oneIt is sooo light weight.It's packing is also soooo good and delivered before time.It's fingerprint sensor and face lock also good but not fastest (finger print)It's having good fast charge but not fastest but it's good.Finally the design is also good .Thank u AMAZON,SAMSUNG  I expect this is helpful to you üòä

  Handy mobile with lots of functions,I have 4/64 variant,Best quality camera but Need to to improve focus Stability of camera, can done via software update,Smmoth screen display ,Nice call quality, charge in 1 &1/2 hours [15% to 100%].No heating in normal uses,Little warm while gaming.SAR values also ok.Wife hotspot network threatening are speediest.Headfone sound is awesome.Samsung m21 wins hearts at 13000price but can win lots more if same can provide under 11000price.

"
"

  Iam purchased this mobile price 13,999/- after 1 week usage the working condition of the mobile absolutely good performance compare to other mobiles in this price range battery,front & back camera absolutely superbSmooth display there is no heating issuesBefore iam purchase iam also searched review and rating but I heard and saw so many negative reviews iam got tensioned ok 1st purchase and see what happens after I'll give this mobile to 5 ***** rating.Awesome performance and no hanging issue

"
"

  Battery life is awesome which remains throughout day and night with continuous usage and Camera is extraordinarily wonderful with DSLR camera clarity pictures.Selfies are crystal clear. Phone performance is nice without any lags even with heavy usage.Processor speed is also perfect. Go ahead with this mobile without second thought.

"
"

  Worst battery , does not even lasts for a day on medium use .This 6000mAh is a fraud.M30 was much better than this in every way.BAD DEAL

"
"

  Really a good non Chinese mid range smartphone.Only problem is 15w charging is very slow for a 6000mah battery..UI is superb and smoothUltra battery saving mode can make battery last for really a long time

"
"

  Overall the phone is good.The screen is very crisp. The UI is clean with no ads like that in Chinese phones. The phone itself is very sturdy and stable. Pubg works just fine for this phone.There is no heating issues at allA full battery is enough for 24 hrs for heavy use.The steady feature in video is very helpful.Camera has a wide capture option.Fingerprint reader sometimes fails to read your finger. The camera quality is decent enough. Once you zoom into a photo you can see that the pic isnt that clear.

"
"

  Over all performance is excellentCamera results - As usual best camera performance with various functionalitySpeed performance - Try PubG game with background download function, No hang issueAudio quality - Soft and niceBattery - Work almost 2dsys in normal use, 4hours with YouTube, 6hours with MovieDesign & look - Best, cell looks soo sexy

"
"

  Samsung M21 that I liked because the most is the display. This is a big phone with a 6.4-inch Full HD+ display. And since the phone uses an AMOLED display, the contrast level is great and the black levels are absolute. Even though a lot of mid-range phones these days offer AMOLED displays, the ones made by Samsung have better displays somehow. I found the screen absolutely fine for reading eBooks, watching YouTube, and web browsing. By the way, the small U-shaped notch doesn‚Äôt annoy me anymore. It did annoy me a lot at the beginning but it soon becomes a part of the scenery.

"
"

  Such a fantastic phone in in this price,I just found pros in that phone no cons,Superb battery life(I'm not a gamer)Camera is fabulousFingerprint reader works properlyFace recognition works wellScreen gives you an amazing feelAnd price is in budgetIt's really a cool phone.If you are thinking about it, I'll say just go for it!And I apreciate amazon's good service.Loved itüëå

"
"

  I like Samsung UI. But the performance of the Exynos 9611 processor and the battery is not so good.Even if I perform simple daily tasks like using Whatsapp, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram, Spotify, and Facebook, I am getting about 7-8 hours of battery life. And that's not a good optimization for a 6000mAh battery.I felt like it will last longer, but it didn't.The camera quality is decent.I love the really beautiful Super Amoled display. That's enough bright for me and looks So good.

"
"

  Writin a review after a week of usage.Amazon delivers this product a day before from scheduled delivery.Feels a bit heavy when you hold this phone for longer duration.Face detection not accurate all times.Camera quality is above average+Long battery life..i charged my phone after 48 hours of moderate usage.Sound and video quality is good....sound feels slightly slower side.Gamings: not prone to games so can comment.Overall an above average phone.8/10

"
"

  1. Battery life is excellent but takes time to charge(>2hrs).2. Camera quality is good at bright light but is horrible during sunlight.3. I liked the display bcz it's not too bright, and I found the colours are good for one's sight.4. No hanging issues yet (using since a month).5. Dolby Atmos good on headphones.6. There's no notification light, but one can use screen or flash light.7. There's no screen recorder.But, there are too many new features to experience.

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.‚ù£üíã‚ù£This phone is great. With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied.I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most.

"

  I am writing my review after using it for 1 month. I  hope it could be good phone but samsung  disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 2.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not a fast charging. Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.Others features are as per price range but if you thinking for a battery packed phone with fast charge,then I would sugget plz search for others phone in same range.

"
"

  I am surprised by the value for money this phone offers. It has got a excellent battery life, almost 2 days on full charge. Equal praise for the display which is bright and sharp. Build quality is good too. Will recommend this phone surely !

"
"

  The product is excellent and as per expectation and also worth the price. However, the headphones which used to be part of mobile accessory (equally important as charger and data cable) were missing or not included with it. Don't know whether the manufacturers stopped giving it as a must or the seller has missed it out in the packet or it has slipped out of package as first time it is observed that the packing by Amazon was awful.

"
"

  Yesterday I had received my samsung M21 .phone was good camera quality but battery is 6000 mh is not working for more than 20hrs ..When phone is  stand by then it's working for 20 hrs..According Battery is 6000mh  it's working for more than 24 hr.But I didn't received mobile bill.Please send me the bill as soon as possible

"
"

  Amazing phone for 14k amount. Specifications wise the phone is mark up to the price. Battery  is really long lasting for  extreme use.  Camera is average . Should not expect more from camera its average. Superamoled screen really gives the feel of enjoying watching movies for longer tym not getting bore over it. Gaming experience of this phone is average not up to the mark its not a gaming phone .

"
"

  I am a POCO f1 user since couple of years, so my experience is based upon it.my new galaxy m21 is 4GB RAM variant.I found this phone very laggy on day to day usage, application launching+loading is too slow. Also, it hangs every now and then.however screen quality and camera quality is as per expextation, but camera UI is also laggy.For a heavy user who does multitasking in an around 8-10 apps,this phone doesn't perform enough good.But, its a good value for money product, i purchased it on offer price of Rs12699.

"
"

  Camera quality,build quality is good but 6000MAH battery work as 4000 MAH battery and 15w charging is not sufficient for this because its take to more time for charging at least 3 hrs for full charging. that's why minimum 25w charger is required and Samsung hv to need for replace charger of all customers of M21 & M31 also for better demands.

"
"

  Not sure about others, I feel like I wasted .with in ,20days I didn't understand my phone behaviour it suddenly gets blank and when I long press nothing works ..power off nor restart.. also when while receiving the product u receive only phone, no screen card and no backpounch.. I see receiving them in other bands..Sure Amazon will not post my review.telling that its improper message.. if they post lucky it helps someone who wants to buy.

"
"

  The quality is worth buying for simple operations face unlock very nice and even finger print unlock is cool battery life for a single charge is coming for@3days using it in home by wife and for whatsapp chat and YouTube and calls.

"
"

  Bought this phone for 12.7k and using it from last 2 months , to be honest the mobile is more than what I have expected. The camera of the mobile is good . Battery back is amazing and for day to day usage this phone is not bad at all. Charging speed is not that fast for a 15w  but I won't complain either. If you are not a very big gamer you can look for this. It can almost handle everything. And one ui is so good though there are some small features which are missing from A series mobiles . But still I can recommend this to over any redmi or realme under the same price.

"
"

  Touch is not so smooth. Camera quality is average. Battery too is average.  Video quality is good.  You can play games like real cricket and pubg without glitch. Vivo u20 is far better than this phone. The only reason u buy this phone is because it's not a china phone.

"
"

  Not a value for money product.The very very important thing the signal strength for any sim operator is very very poor you will not get even 2 lines out of 5 of signal.Battery life is not like it should be for 6000mah mobile should have.Auto adjust screen brightness system is also very poor as it drain battery very much as it uses front camera as a sensor.It even don't have an inbulit aaplock you had to download third party app to lock your app.This product doesnot stand on my expectation for a phone with this high price.

"
"

  SAMSUNG GALAXY M21 is a master piece at such a low PRICE. Superb Dolby Atmos sound, feather smooth touch, excellent screen, UI, 6GB/128 GB RAM/Storage--means no legging operation and superb Camera. Thanks to SAMSUNG.Delivery on time with proper packing. Thanks to AMAZON.

"
"

  I am writing this review after one month of use. Worst product in this range. Not standing anywhere in front of Oppo/Redmi products. I bought it because I hate Chinese products. A big spot has come up on the screen which is increasing day by day. Service center says that it is because of hitting the screen and No warranty of screen display. I spent 14000/ now again it requires 5500/ for repair just after one month of purchase.  There were many other clients were complaining the same problem at the service center. Pl don't buy it.

"
"

  ¬†High rated games run on high graphics &FHDFingerprint reader is work smoothly but some time is not work in all atampts.Bigg battery 6k mah but i m not satisfy that .its life time is like 4000mah..Camera- work good on photography, panorma,wide angle 8mp is verry good camera suffer in low light Rear video sestabelization is work impressively.but but but video recording have not auto focus and not do white balance properly. Manually its work excellent..supper amolede screen is really supper.

"
"

  An awesome phone, suitable for Social Media and Reading. Awesome speakers assist with Dolby via headphone for music lovers.Monster battery and excellent display, oneui makes it easy to navigate with a single hand.An easy 1 and half day lasting battery, Should have supported 25w fast charging but im okay with 15w as i always charge phone while im sleeping.For gaming enthusiasts there are many phones out there but for others i think this is the right go to choice.

"
"

  this is a nice option if you want to buy a mid range non chinese phone but disclaimer is- camera quality is poor- Screen is fragile and broke after 20 days on dropping once from 3ft- Specs are avg but battery life is goodOverall an avg phone if you compare with Mi and Realme in same price.Use a good quality screen protector else be ready to spend 6k for screen replacement.

"
"

  The product is just waste of money.And it's not the case that I have got a defective product, I have replaced it once still facing same issues.1. The calls don't connect most of the time, which is a major problem as it's the most basic functionality of the phone.2. It just hits up too quickly, temperature goes from 33¬∞C to 38-39¬∞C in just 4-5 min.3. Fingerprint sensor is not that good, it doesn't work sometimes.And there are many minor issues with the product.I recommend not to buy the mobile.

"
"

  Writing this after a month's use.Phone is quite good in this price range, Battery is awesome charging speed is quite OK.Camera is also Nice and gets good shots during day light, don't expect so much quality during the low light ir night time.It supports Extreme in PUBG mobile but doesn't gives stable frame rates. Frame rates fluctuate between 30-45-50 depending on the internet and temperature.Overall quite good in its budget. I exchanged my 2.5 yeas old phone and got 3100 rs discount so overall nice deal.

"
"

  Starting from the beginning.I bought this phone a month ago and using since then for online teaching for 5 hrs daily plus atleast 1 hour gaming by my cousin and some other and it never disappointed me battery is really a monster and I  charge it only in night and on rigorous uses it gives backup of atleast 12 hrs. Camera quality is excellent and looks are superb much more soothing than images i saw while purchasing its triple camera setup looks damm cool. Display is awwwwwsome movie watching is excellent.It is best in class. And yes, it is not a chinese product.

  ¬†1. After heavy use at 9 am to 11 pm, the battery level drops to 35-45%.2. Exynos is little bit slow... you can play Pubg  smoothly. You can get 35-45 fps at pubg.3. Camera is good for daily usage... not for professional mobile photography... shutter speed customization is not available.4. Speaker is not so loud. It is ok for one person. Pubg on the speaker is not a good experience...5. There is no option for internet speed monitoring on the screen bar. You have to install software from play store.

  PROS : The mobile is good looking but the back side look can be better.The display quality is amazing seems like display of flagship phone .The battery life is very impressive.The always on display is awesome.The camera both front and back take good pictures.Pros : The back side polycarbonate material  is not good .I used the phone for 15 days and scratches  can be seen on the back side.The processor exynos 9611 is not good for gaming .Overall the phone is amazing and value for money.

  This phone is Ok Ok not worth the price. It is slow, gets heated during calls and mic issue sometimes, battery is not that great it doesnt last whole day for me. Camera is too bad specially front one. Not a good deal and after that amazon fraud of Rs 235 hidden charge which bank will take and written somewhere in terms which no one in is gonna read.

  ¬†I am a Samsung lover. I brought this mobile M21 on July 2020. 4gb 64 gb variant. This time I am disappointed.  Science 3 months i am useing this phone . In first few days phone dosen't have any issue.  But from one month i face lot of hang problem. I dont love to play game. I am using just YouTube and others browsing. And ram and memory is not over loaded. I am not recommend this phone.

"
"

  Lot of heating issues while browsing or charging and also while talking as little as 5min.takes long time to get charged to 100%.Didnt expect this from samsung.Mi is much better never had heating issues.samsung m21 model is big failure .its sooo heavy .amazon response for complaint is worst .nobody cared in amazon helpline.had very bitter experience in both the product n amazon service .please dnt buy this mobile

"
"

  Perfect for people who use their phone for work purpose & drawing :)‚Ä¢Fingerprint reader is great, just as they claimed.‚Ä¢The battery life is decent.‚Ä¢Camera Quality is ""fine"", could've been better.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢But out of everything, I loves the smooth performance I had using it.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢And the best part, I got such a great doodling experience at this price.

"
"

  I love this phone but if u r expecting for performance while compared to other phones at this price it will be little disappointing. for a average daily usage this phone is awesome. Display is very nice and UI is smooth and fast. feels comfortable in hand usage. You have to be very careful that back panel gets easily scratch able at normal placing on floor and you have to be ready with  the  case when the phone arrives in your hand.  otherwise really a nice package from samsung. loved the productt

"
"

  First of all I have to say the phone I received is not upto full charge and when Pressed power button it was is recovery screen.which means some one used that phone for a while then returned it...I am paying this 12,699/- amount for a brand new. phone not a used one. The battery charge was at 52%. I have never seen any phone which is not less than 95 percent before unboxing it.......If you guys providing these goods to customer please check it first before packing ...but I am happy with the product because my father is happy .as it is given to him for his b'day..... ...Thank you

"
"

  Samsung is the new benchmark of reliability..I ordered 2 pieces of m21 (both 4/64 and 6/128)Looks wise this phone is good as well as build quality or we can say exteriors of the phone is like shining sun in the water..The best thing I like about this monster is speed.MThis phone can make all the tasks very easy and super fast(we don't hav bullet train but samsung can built that ;-) )Amazing artificial intelligence  is used in this phone it is catching our interests and working according to that..Overall it is the monster in 7inches box

"
"

  I have the 4gb version. It's alright as a device. Display and battery is awesome. Just if there was support for a higher watt charging, it would have been great.Day to day use I find UI to be slight laggy and there a definite stutter in between scrolling. An update with ultra smooth scrolling will be helpful.Also a double tap to sleep will be a welcomed in coming updates.

"
"

  Have been using for a week now. The phone impresses with its screen and camera quality from the word go. The UI is smooth and the sound quality is quite superb.The thing that stands out the most is battery.  Even after heavy usage the phone lasts for 48 hours on single charge.At this price the purchase must be a no brainer.

"
"

  I am using this mobile from a month and this masterpiece didn't let me down. Awesome battery backup, awesome fingerprint sensor and the face unlock feature.Phone doesntlag even if you use it in the moderate battery saver mode. And the best things which I enjoyed are- 1. It's focus mode- where you could restrict the use of apps.2. It's digital wellbeing setting in which you could see how much time you're spending on a particular app.3. This phoneüòÄCamera quality is awesome too, both front and back. And love the design.Thank you Samsung.

"
"

  The display of this m21 phone has gone faded and now it's got black on the half of the screen. What to do,its a total wastage of money.i am really very much frustrating now.its not been  more than 3-4 months that I bought this phone and now  I am facing such issues without  any reason.what to do now. No one is going to help me out now. So simply I would like to tell everyone that not to buy  samsung phone and this model too...I will never recommend you guys. Trust me it happened automatically. Dont buy Samsung phone ever üëèüëè

  Truly amazing phone in budget-midrange.What else you want when a phone has 6000mah battery with fast charging and c port, with 48mp camera triple slot, and a fantastic Amoled notch display.I got this phone around 12500 and using this phone since 15 days no problem at all tu lots addition small features also that will make more feasible to you when u use it, such as inbuilt app cloning, in built call recording and more such features.Best mid ranger in this price range.

  Hi Friends,If you want to buy non-chines mobile, best Samsung in Android. Battery back - 100%Camera- 95%Performance- 85%finger sensor- 50%overall 8/10Really good and cheap mobile with good performance.

"
"

  I ordered this model on 14th of July and got it by 17th. After not even using it for a day, it stopped working, the screen became unresponsive and it won't unlock. I tried to restart it but once it switched off, it hasn't opened since.I put a exchange request and I was supposed to get the phone on 20th, but the delivery agent's number ends up being busy. I don't know what to do and I feel helpless because I don't have other phone to use as a backup cause I exchanged it with this phone.I've been trying to contact the delivery since yesterday but all in vain.

"
"

  My First Battery charge :68% to100% in 1hr 27 mins. I feel amazing of using Samsung Galaxy M21 with Andriod 10. The Selfie camera is my favourite one 20MP which is very clear and original. The Watta battery is way big enough for one-day usage.The Gaming in my Galaxy M21 feels cool and I played PUBG Mobile is no lag at all. Overall My Rating for Samsung Galaxy M21 is 5/5.I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, thanks to Samsung and Amazon.

"
"

  It stopped working and got purple screen after a month itself and service center said we need to pay 5k for repair when there was no accidental nor liquid damage. They made wait for a week to inform I need to pay and have no answer why it doesn't come under warranty. I would never recommend this mobile or M series to anyone.

"
"

  Good battery life. Just take lot of time to full charge. Good camera as compared to Mi note 8 pro. I am not pubg player but spend lot of time on YouTube Twitter Instagram so this phone works full day with continues wifi connectivity and sound from speakers.Can only add 3 fingerprints. Charger can be improved.

"
"

  Overall rating is greater. And mobile processors performance is pretty good for normal usage but you play some high quality game it will get little bit hanging. Battery life is so good  it performs well, for normal usage of battery it comes couple of days and you can heavy usage will comes one day. Obviously we should talk about the camera performance, It not much better but I took some better quality photos and we take the slow motion video after taking that video having some errors occurred, I hope it may recover the upcoming updates. But it worthy for money.

"
"

  I chose this product for loudness of sound, long battery backup and uninterrupted operation. I am satisfied. I put is for charging when battery power is 20% and stop charging when the power is about 80%.It lasts for more than 24 hours.

"
"

  An excellent product at the price band. I have been using Samsung phone for last 20 years and never regretted. My last Samsung phone On7 retired after years of use, So bought this. Also Using Samsung Galaxy S7 for last few years. I was looking for a good battery backup with smooth internet function for my second phone and Samsung M21 fulfill both perfectly. 6 RAM assure smooth functioning while 6000 mah battery keep the phone allways working. As usual Amazon delivered the product on time. Thank You Samsung and Amazon.

"
"

  I bought it inspite of the price increse as i thought Samsung phones are good but to my disapointment my phone had a yellow tint to it which i got rid of with great difficulty but the colour disply ate still not good...battry life is not what they say...poor product

"
"

  I had bought this mobile in the month of July. Simlly its amazing. The fingerprint reader is apt and uninterrupted as found in many mobiles. With the one time charging, the battery lasts almost 48 hrs which is a foremost miracle for the customers consuming heavy data usage. The camera is incredibly high in quality. Worth buying this product. It's an investment-cum-asset for the people who tend to work even after office hours and during traveling as well. It's a complete support system for any kind of business and/or jobs.

"
"

  I am using M21 for the past 40 days. The fingerprint reader is at par with its rivals. The battery life is very good, it also last for 1.5 days at normal usage. But the charging takes longer time. The camera quality is also good for the 48 MP camera.Positives1. One UI2. Camera quality3. User experience4. Fingerprint reader and face unlock5. Battery lifeNegative1. Small issue with the call volume2. Charging time3. Samsung apps ask for frequent updates

"
"

  Decent phone on this price range. Big plus is battery and disply quality. Display is too good üëå.Camera is not that good. But ok for average users. Night mode is horrible.Processor is bit outdated and on lower side campared other device on this price range. You will find lag here and there on even normal use. Overall good.

"
"

  This was an amazing product and a best phone at an amazing price. But the disappointments are first there was no back cover along with this model. And the charger was two short. Except these two issues everything is nice in this phone. Especially camara, performance, durability are very nice. And also no lag in this phone. You can surely buy this mobile for sure. It's absolutely an amazing experience using this phone. But remember charger is short and there is no back cover along with this phone remaining features are very nice. Thank you. üôè

"
"

  Phone is nothing less than an oven after using the camera for 5 minutes. Coming to camera, the 48MP camera they have provided is the worst camera I have ever seen. Primary camera provides patched images and ultra vide camera gives very low light images. Slow motion, ultra  slow motion camera quality is very very poor. Display is a weak point, not as clear as other phone displays. Very dim display. Finger print is somewhat slow.  If you want to waste some money and take some stress going to service centre for repair then buy this phone. Amazon's delivery was too slow.

"
"

  pros and cons are described belowPros: 6000MaH Battery  sAmoled display  one ui launcher  video recordingcons:  not fit for gaming  image clarity is not up the mark  slow charging  no TPU case is provided in the boxIf you Want a Better Camera go for M31 With 64mp Quad camera and 32mp front camerDelivery is goodgreat for normal usage !

"
"

  Excellent product. Otherthan the processor which is old not for gaming. But still it's a great product (Non chinese). Battery beast. super amoled Display is very bright & Nice UI. Good one from samsung.

"
"

  Best nonchinese smartphone under 14kPros : Camera is good in daylight condition.Battery is monster.Only smartphone under 14k that provides super amoled display.Processor is also good enough at this price point.Cons : No glass body at back.Average camera quality in low light condition.Can play heavy games in medium settings but frame drops in hdr or high settings.

"
"

  Switched to m21 from m20Pros:1.Camera is freaking awesome, hyperlapse, night mode,wide angle,portrait mode , all working fine, takes some seconds for saving 48mp photos.2. Super Amoled display is very good as Amoled display mobiles are starting from this range as of now.3. Exynos 9611 does the job very well4. 6000mAh battery alond with 15w charger5. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is fast .That's all from my sideI don't have any concerns with it..

"
"

  It's a good phone for who want a best display and battery at this price rangeOne ui seems to be good. Cameras are good though in daylights but in artificial and night it stuggle. There is no google camera for this device . Processor is good daily multitasking but it sucks in heavy tasks . Samsung should start providing Snapdragon processor .Conclusion-You can purchase this if you want reputed brand with best display (super amoled) , big battery (6000mAh), good daylight camera , best ui . It fulfills almost all needs . Go for it ü§û

"
"

  I am writing this review after 2 months of usage.The phone exceeds expectations, especially in this segment thanks to its outstanding display and long battery life.The camera performance is comparatively better than competitors, but sometimes the pictures come out bit oversaturated.The phone truly has a premium feel even with the plastic back.Pros-*Display *Battery life *Build quality *CameraCons-*Fingerprint sensitivity *Charging time (2+hrs)

"
"

  A better Non-Chinese brand phone with good features.The Camera is not as expected from Samsung which gives exceptional outputs.A little disappointed.Could be even better with Snapdragon chipset.Somewhat disappointed with back built quality looking little pathetic which gets scratches easily.It do have good features:Impressive displayLong batteryUser friendly interfaceGood sound qualityCompact designAn overall good performaning phone for the people with normal usage(NON-GAMERS)

  Worst Product ( Samsung M21) Please don't buy this Product, Full Heating issue and Amazon Customer is worst than product. No body give solution  for purchased product. Faulty and defect products only Amazon selling. People Please go for Flipkart my kind request. I use to spoke with more than 5 to 6 Persons in Customer Care, Nobody given solution for me. Totally disappointed with AMAZON.

"
"

  A very nice product from Samsung. Battery backup is really excellent. Good for moderate gaming. Doesn't heats more while charging and even while gaming. Camera too snaps a good pairs of shorts and one can even enjoy some good selfies due to the 20 mp sensors. Due to plastic build and protection of of gorilla glass 3 if u ask my opinion its better to go with a temperate glass screen protector and a back cover because neither of both the things are bundled up in the box. But overall a must buy phone for moderate users.üëç

"
"

  Awesome purchase!!!üòç1.Battery backup upto 2 days.2.Camera quality is awesome. Ultra wide lens  is very useful and wonderful.3.We can play games like pubg and free fire  without any lag for 8 hours continuosly.4.Very good audio quality.5.We can watch 1080p videos.6.Super amoled display is superb to watch  movies on mobile phone.Tottally wonderful product.

  I am writting review after 7 days of use.It is really a monster.Very good performance in gaming and normal daily use.Battery fast charging, last uptown 2.5 day's.Fingerprint also very fast.Camera quality also awesome .Display sAmoled best viewing experience, compare to other chinese brand.

"
"

  It's very good phone which have very fast charging and excellent camera quality it has very good user interface. Now come to the point it is far better than and  the other phones comparing the display which is amazing .I am using it for a month or so and I have liked  it so much that I bought it twice and my brother in law and my  sister in law also bought it. thank you.

  Review after a weekBattery : 5/5For me it lasts about two daysCharging : definitely not fast charging. It takes more than 2hours to charge my phone completely.Display: 5/5Best display üíØCamera: 3/5OkayPerformance: 3/5For some basic games also it lags sometimesFace lock and finger print reader are not so fastNo Back cover, No Screenguard, please order them while ordering phoneAlways my Airtel sim signal shows one line or 2 lines.. poor network connection

"
"

  Excellent budget mobile with excellent camera quality. Except that it comes with only 15 watt charger for a monstrous 6000 mah battery( only drawback compare to M30s) there is not a single  drawback in this product. In this price range samsung has given super AMOLED screen which in itself is quite surprising. If u are a heavy gamer then u might feel some lag( due to old processor) but for day to day usage it's a perfect budget phone.

"
"

  Pathetic phone. It fell from very low height and on carpeted floor and yet it's screen broke. Replaced it with original smasung screen and got faulty again. Overall spend additional 6000 on it still useless. Don't buy such worthless mobiles.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is a good phone in this price range. I m using from last 15 days and it's working fine .Camera quality is goodDisplay quality is superb colours showing beautiful.Battery is also working fine .I m totally satisfied with this product as now . And I hope it's work same like today in future also.

"
"

  Super screen, 6000mAH, Fast Charging, super smooth finger print reader And Very Good camera quality in this price range.Samsung is Best..

"
"

  Sometimes what happens is while making a call the ringing sound disappears and I have to switch off then switch on to make it work again during this period neither can I make call nor I receive it.This has been very troubling part and I guess this problem is only limited to my phone. Maybe this is a defected piece.

"
"

  If u wish to buy Non Chinese brand at budget range, than go for this. i got this at 12600/- and 500 rs cash back.Pros.Display is awesome. 402 ppi will give you feel good displayCalling clarity is good.48 mp camera gives you best pictures.Cons.Battrey dropped to 35% after full charging from 24 hours even it has 6000 mah.Not shown network speedno front flash lightFingure print working too late. it takes 2-3 sec to unlock.Overall Rating 4/5.

"
"

  nice looking phone..all fine ..battery is superb.all day usage but battery is on ...back camera superb.front camera needed improvement...user interface is just awesome...as usual  samsung ---- value with little bit more money 13,999 :-)

"
"

  Don't  buy if u r a selfie lover ...camera quality  is like 5mp camera

"
"

  I purchased this few days ago and it is pretty awesome. I think this is the best phone in this price. I have used many phones of samsung and other companies but I find samsung is the best, it's camera quality of 48megapixel is better than most of the mobiles in this price. It has few cons. First is that the finger print reader takes some time to recognize finger and second is that it takes very much time to fully charge the battery but the battery life is very good.

"
"

  It's best budget phone with amazing features review after one weekPros-1. Amazing display and video viewing experience2. Superb battery3. Good built quality4. Decent processor with good performance except heavy gaming5. Nice camera quality6. Value for money productCons-1. Need to install case and screen  protector as early as possible2. Audio output is not loud but quality is goodIt  is a value for money product.

"
"

  The best phone under 15k segment. Battery & camera are the best in M21 but the Display is one step further, i mean I used several phones under 20k but never saw this type of HD screen.100/100 for the screen.It's been a month, but didn't find any lag issue & fully satisfied with battery backup that it easily last for a day or more(as per usage).What I dislike is the picture quality in night light.It's not that much noticable but it's there.It may be fixed with update.Overall 10/10.

"
"

  After using it for 5 days I can say that this self claimed 6000mah battery is not only not worth, but also battery life is poor than Asus 4000mah. Please either mention the actual battery capacity or make it originally 6000mah

"
"

  After Comparing lot of mobiles, i went ahead for Samsung M21 as Samsung Brand itself is a Promising name. I am Very much happy with this Purchase. The Highlights of the phone are:1. Very Nice Look and Feel.2. 6000 mAh Battery Lasted for more than 1 and the half day.3. Lots of options in Camera and very nice clarity.4. Slightly lesser in Weight as compared to the Competitors.5. Super fast while gaming.Overall Great Deal.

"
"

  I ordered mobile for my brother. Mobile is looking very in hand feeling. Its have a biggest battery life. The super amoled display. Camera quality is super, so many features there for camera. Samsung maintained weight management is good. Finally I recommend this mobile for who love display, big battery and samsung brand name. So go for it .u will b satisfied. üëçüëå

"
"

  This phone is only for those who do not want to buy Chinese phone brand.The picture gets blurred when u zoom the camera while taking images.This is not at all a 48mp camera.It takes images like 12mp camera.Other than that battery life is excellent and charging takes more than 3 hrs from 0 to 100 percentage.The processor sometimes lags even when we play games at normal settings.Processor is not was good as sd720g.If u are not a heavy gamer you can buy this.Display is amazing.Selfie camera is perfect.No heating issue

"
"

  I would say Samsung still far behind in mid range phones. Poor Camera quality, 6000 mah battery drains like 3000 mah, charge time 2.30 hrs, sluggish performance. At 14k other brands offer good specification alongside excellent performance. This phones is not even a match to year old Redmi Note 7pro. I am giving 2 stars just for One UI. Worst part it doesn't have Ambient light sensor but uses Front camera for adaptive brightness which consumes about 10% off 100% battery.

"
"

  The Galaxy M21 has a big display that measures 6.4 inches, and has thin bezels at the top and the sides. The chin is considerably thicker. At the top, it has a waterdrop notch that houses the selfie camera and a tiny earpiece right above it. You can reach the top of the display if you have big hands, else you'll need to shuffle a little to reach the top. However, this phone isn't as big as the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, which we recently reviewed.

"
"

  I got the mobile on 25th and waiting for back cover to deliver.On 27th July, I setup the mobile and put it on charge.Mobile was sufficiently changed but suddenly start screen appears and hung.Mobile was not starting at all.Again I put the mobile on charge for 20 min but on screen only charging symbol was coming and mobile was not starting. I didn't expect such fault from Samsung.Thanks to Amazon Technical support who tried to fixed the issue and at last raised a replacement order. Hoping ,I could get the good one.

"
"

  Really a great phone by Samsung..my mother is using it for the last few days and she is really happy with the new gadgetJust to highlight a few good points about the phone- Good Camera and Battery is great- Touch on the screen is really smooth- Speakers are really good, loud and clear music and specially for inspiring old people the ringtone is also clearly audible

"
"

  We've been using samsung smartphones and of course, the M21 is a device that actually amazed me. At this price point, the quality of the display is amazing. And also the MONSTER 6000mah battery is also stands about one and a half day easily. Those who are looking for a sAmoled display with a decent camera quality, at this price point, I personally recommend this one. If you are an intensive gamer, I will not recommend this. For gaming purposes there is Redmi note 9 pro at this same price.

"
"

  Truly amazing display panel. Fingerprint reader is quick, also face unlock works in dark. I got 60 hours of standby with normal usage. It has been a week now , charged only 3 times. Recieved an update also. It is a monster in all areas.

"
"

  After use of one week. In this range phone is very good. Bettery life is very good and the performances of phone is over all good. Gaming performance is also good. It gets heated when used for longer time. Faront Camera is not looks like a 20 MP its should be improved. It do not have back cover and cheap quality of plastic is used  forback side so when u buy it side by side buy the cover to protect it. And at the end it's not a fast changing it takes 3 hours for full charge.

"
"

  Product seems to be good in this price range..It works smooth no lags.Fingerprint sensor my quite disappoint you if your fingers have lil amount of sweat not a big thing..clear it it will be back.Battery life is quite good i can use it whole day on a single charge. 24 hrs . No heating issue found on normal usage.Camera is decent at day times but may utterly disappoint you at night times both selfie and rear.Overall the pros are greater then cons so overall i am satisfied in this pricerange.

"
"

  This product is good. It delivered 1 day prior to me thanks to Amazon.Camera is good 4/5Battery is also good 4.5/5User experience (UI, processing speed, memory storages) 4/5.Fast charging also good, taking 30-60 mins to full from 50% of charge.There is no heating issue as I've tested it for 1 day by installing all the apps and playing games.Overall (4/5) good phone can buy it.After 2 months of usage, phone is still good

"
"

  Yes, it's worth buying Samsung M21 . The Samsung m21 is built for media consumptions. It's a feast to watch videos on that device as it has amoled panel and words are not enough to say that, you should experience it personally. It has insane battery life. You need not charge m21 for 2 days if you are an average user BEST . The best part of the phone is camera yes camera outstanding  performance  you can capture everything  in real frame I loved it ,even selfie camera gives you good performance  .So, its worth buying Samsung m21...realmonsta in Samsung family

"
"

  I purchased this for my dad who is never a fond of using high price and premium smartphones. But, Samsung Galaxy M21 gives all the features within a reasonable range and with a great quality that any individual wants in today's date.Display is superb so as its touch. We get an excellent battery back-up with a fast charger.Fully Made in India and gives a great competition to Chinese competitors (The only non-Chinese company in the top 5 list of smartphone sellers in India).

"
"

  Review after two weeks of usage:Nice displayNo heating issues as of nowPlayed small games and loaded fineNo performance issues on using lot of apps on 4gb ram mobile.Its 6000 mah battery, but I am charging my mob daily. One movie a day and then YouTube Facebook surfing for most of the day.Slight UI Issues. Sometimes words go out of the frame.Back cam is normal.  Front cam is good on Morning, and very bad on low lights.  On low lights it looks like VGA camera.Slightly difficult to remove headset from port .

"
"

  I don't know whether its just the product I got or this product in general is like this.Fingerprint sensor as well as face unlock sucks. It is working as if the product is 2 to 3 years old it senses my Fingerprint after 4 to 5 attempts sometimes even more than that.Battery life is not what I expect I need to charge it twice a day. Even though it 6000 mAH . I just use for normal use like insta whatsapp etc . And  camera is not that great , as I expected it to be coz it is 48 mp. Overall product sucks.

"
"

  A good phone with great specifications.  The overall specs and quality are good. There are few issues with software. Sometimes the volume of videos automatically goes to zero and few issues in camera software like unable to video few times exists but other functions and quality of photos and video are at par with the phones in the range. Battery life is awesome which was the prime reason for me for buying. Overall satisfied with the product

"

  I absolutely love this model. First of all, the overall front and back look is beautiful, which is a No. 1 plus for me. The fingerprint reader is quick and sensitive. I love the camera quality, it's very clear and sharp. Pictures don't blur too much when zoomed in. The screen display is fascinating. It has HD display and there's a great feel when watching movies on my phone. Lastly, about equally important battery life. The battery takes some time to charge, but it stays for a long time. I could go a day without plugging it in the charger.

  I afraid to purchase samsung mobile at this budget, as many says it's not that worthy ....but this handset has cleared all my myths and proved good replacement for mi1)  sAMPOLED Screen....5 stars2) display dimension......5 stars3) Good battery backup...4 stars4) Average camera quality ...3 stars5) Fingerprint reader sometime troubles....3.5 stars5) 15W charger ...takes 2:30 hours to charge 100%.....3.5 starsand specially it does not hang being minimum budget phone

"
"

  Using it for 1 month.1. Display is awesome2. Performance is good as it has UFS storage, didn't tested any high end games3. Camera is OK not the best (but compared to price it's good enough)4. 15W fast charge5. My only problem is it's battery, it has a 6000mah battery,so you can expect 2 days battery life but it didn't last more than 1 day with daily usage (not gaming)

"
"

  one word Super mid range smart phone,  basic to moderate smart mobile phone users go for this blind folded, super battery life and Samsung displays are 5 star displays. Don't get confused by mobile reviewers in YouTube they always expect too many unwanted features as required basic to moderate users, the only con which can be mentioned in real life usage is charging duration is not bad but could have been a little better other is Samsung increased the price thumbs down samsung for that

"
"

  Well phone is just average, not as good as described.Pro's:- display quality is really good.- touch sensitivity is also good- all sensors functions good- Battery backup is just average, to compare its 6000mah capacity- processor is good it runs lag free PubCons:- Pictures taken on camera are not so clear even though it's  48mp and 20mp images are blurry.-It takes almost 2.5hrs to 3hrs to charge full Battery.

  Product  is Very Nice as Expected  From Samsung  fingerprint and battery  and  Also Camera Quality  is Nice one Thing  I dislike  is Some Times internet  Is Gone And You have To  OFF it and Again ON  So it back in Effect  Overall  Best Smartphone  In This Price Range

"
"

  This message is to the buyers who decides on reviews.You can buy this product.It's features are excellent, especially the inbuilt Long lasting battery.Regarding delivery Amazon:I have ordered this phone for a birthday as a gift ,when I ordered the phone the actual delivery is after two days of the required date,but Amazon delivered the package on the same date at which I required,Thanks to Amazon.The deliver boy too maintained Covid rules and distances and delivered in time,thanks to the delivery boy too.

"

  Camera not good even  triple cameras are available, selfie camera is ok, battery heating up during browsing, phone clarity and build are ok, battery lasts for one day only, charging taking 03 hours to reach 100%,

"
"

  Overall it is a good smartphone. Battery usage, background application activity, image quality, processing... Everything is optimised. The screen is a key feature to choose over other smartphones as it shows big difference compared to other smartphones in this price range. One UI has given an amazing experience so far. It shows the difference of samsung from other brands. One thing is that, if someone want only gaming and processor experience in excess over other features, then there are other brands. Otherwise, you can easily go for this model.

"
"

  When compared with phones of other brand(similar specs), I feel it is overpriced. I went for it because I want to buy a non-Chinese make. The auto mode/focus is better in other phones. I am really happy with the battery as it lasts for more than 30 hrs.  The 4GB RAM does a decent job.

"
"

  battery life is not at all good....for normal usage (Facebook & what's app) battery drying very fast, from 100 to 20 with in half a dayit is not at all working like 6000mah

"
"

  I have purchased this mobile 1 month back and screen changed color after 15 days and within 1 month whole screen has gone blank.. Customer care is very pathetic and said screen is not covered in warranty and it's mechanical damage without even Examining handset. New screen will require Rs. 6000. Started using my old MI mobile which is still better working. Don't waste your hard earned money on this company. They are just using old marketing tactics of antichina sentiments.. To sell you third class products.

"
"

  It is quiet impressive to have a 6000mah battery at such a price segment with a good 15W charger. The inbox charger takes almost 2 hr and 30 mins to fully charge the phone which is the only cons. If the charging capacity was improved to charge such a monster battery, the phone could have been unbeatable. But still it is a better option than those Chinese phones. The one UI experience+SAmoled+6000mah is like having a pancake with extra butter and honey. It's all new next level. And after all, the best part of a Samsung product is their after sales service.

"
"

  I am using it for last 10days. I got to notice that i had to charge it on daily basis even in below normal usage, initially i ignored it but it is persisted which compelled me give 2 star and write this review. I dont know what is wrong with my handset , I try to contact samsung cutomer care but due to lockdown they r not responding.... may be I had got defected one... otherwise all the fratures in these phone is really worth at this price range, If I haven't had faced battery issue i definitely given 5 star....

"
"

  I am a former oneplus3t user, after using this device I am very happy with the overall experience.The USP of this device are :1.Super_amoled f-HD display (very bright colours üòç), gives u flagship experience.2.Big 6000mah battery.3.Good camera.4.Last but not least Samsung's one ui, its actually good ui with loads of features.The only thing I don't like about this device is 15w fast charging, this takes slightly more time to get the big battery charger.Overall I loved the device, as it's super value for money.

"
"

  First of all it has a good battery life and lasts upto 2 days. It gives you good quality gaming and also provides 6 inch screen for enjoying movies. It has 48 megapixel camera which is good for nature as well as personal photography . Moreover it has ample memory and lets you download the latest apps from playstore. I have been using it without screen guard and it still has no smudge or scratches. A good phone giving an individualistic experience and confidence to the user to deal with an entire day or more.

"
"

  Very nice phone with good combination of all facilities. No heating problem in any condition. Battery life is awesome. Camera have artificial self modification presentation. It should be natural original effect.very fast accessible. But screen touch should be only on figure but it can sence any type of material touch. Touch is very sensitive. Everything is present in this phone. Don't have any difference between 1lac price phone & this phone except looks. Face detection is very fast. Company have to think about metal body in this price range.

"
"

  I received phone on dat:31.06.2020 and today date:13.06.2020 ,mobile charging was not taking.And yesterday(12.06.2020) only date of returning over.I request Amazon atleast give 15days time for mobile product.So who interested to buy M21,it is highly risky to buy.Due to avoid china product i have gone for samsung instead of Redmi and now my situtation is embrassing and feeling bad for my decision.

"
"

  1. Finger prints senser very very bad,  Senser not work without press power key.2. Battery not performing as 60000 mah  capacity .3. Network connecting capacity is almost low,  Friends call me but they says , your phone is  switched off.  For use internet also problem creat4. Diffrent Pendrive saport is software problem,  it can be sort out by company,if he want by software updatesFinally I am not satisfied with 14000‚Çπ .Loss of our hardships amount

"
"

  After using it for more than a month I can most certainly say it's better than it's Redmi or Realme counterparts as Samsung offers AMOLED display as compared to LCD displays in the other phones which puts lesser strain on your eyes if you use your phone for more than 5-6 hours in day.The camera is of good quality and photos are crisp and clear. Battery backup is also great.

"
"

  I must say this is best budget segment phone. This mobile is basically  for non-gamer. I liked the monster battery ,super amoled display and outstanding  camera . I must recommend this non - chinese powerful smartphone .

"
"

  I bought the phone for Rs12,699 and for that price the phone is good with excellent battery life, average camera, good fingerprint reader, one the the best display for the price. Well I am not a heavy gamer so I don't mind the processor, the phone can handle day to day tasks with ease. I am more of a media consuming person so for me the things that I prefer in a smartphone are the display, audio output and the battery life. This phone is the best phone for media consumption.

"
"

  My first phone was samsung Y...it was an amazing phone...Now after many years I have again choosen samsung because samsung has succeeded to beat the current competition and come up with this beauty...Galaxy M21...thanks a lot samsung for providing such a great flagship phone in a budget...great Camera...Great battery life...great display...and as a result....great experience...no hanging...just more than awesome...sound quality is unbeatable...in earphones...this phone provides Dolby digital...which again acts a USP of this phone..

"
"

  I bought it boycotting #ChinaProducts though it hs some issues....Pros......#1.Battery heats a lot ,drains fast not loook like 6000mah, #2.Camera not looks like 48mp, #3.mic quality is very low.#4.Fingerptint is slow.Cons.#1.Good sound quality#2.Processor is fast.#3.Fast Charge#4.Not a China product.

"
"

  I thought 6gb variant only is good for gaming as my 4gb variant hanged a bit for starting 4 days but later , i think it's because of software updates playing PUBG on my 4gb variant is also so butter smooth ! Am getting screen on time around 10 to 12 hours on a single charge and 1 to 2 hours of gaming , am very much satisfied with the battery life , the display of this phone is very good , no other brand can provide you with this quality in the price range of 12k to 25k ! The only thing missing is stereo speakers. Over all opinion , just go for it !!!

"
"

  Sumsung M21 is an all-rounder phone. Phone has  good camera quality , bigger battery backup and specially its display .Pros : 1. DISPLAY  2. BATTERY  3. CAMERA  4. Special features like Dolby and  separate app soundCons : 1. It took around 2:30 to 3 hours to full  charge

"
"

  First of all phone is very light in weight although having 6000 mah large battery. Phone looks very premium. Looks and finish is very good. Display is very bright nd colors are so real. Both cameras are awesome. Interface is also very smooth like every samsung phone. Battery backup is superb full day video playback ability. Charging is very quick. All of the above it's make in india. So must go with it.

"
"

  Awesome..only one to describe  this phone...battery life is good.. remains charged more than day  even if you charge it up to 90%..camera quality  is too good..my knowledge  about phone is mot much..but this phone is more then my expectations....soooooo happy to buy this..definitely  anyone can buy it without  second  thought

"
"

  good battery back up. I use mobile data through hotspot with this mobile, Bluetooth on, GPS on and get battery life for full day.Camera is very bad. every time you click a pic, first pic will be a blank pic.

"
"

  The battery life is superb. The camera is awesome. Its better to go for an M21 over M31 if you are not a camera fanatic since for seldom user as yourself you will be amazed at the level of clarity the phone provides you with. The quality of image projected on the other side during a video call would amaze the receiver. The RAM/processor is amazing. Super satisfied. Have been recommending this to a lot of people since the purchase.

"
"

  Fingerprints function is very good. You may unlocked phone by simple touch.battery is 6000mah very good backup.  If you not use so much than only 25% is drain in whole day. Camara is 48mp so pic should be like HD but not so clear and looking like other 15 MP camera pic. Call pick function is also not good so many time have to swipe to received call.

"
"

  It is a good over all budget phone. Excellent samsung amoled screen and extremely good battery life.  Overall it is justified for its price. Processor could have been a little powerful. But it gets the job done for day to usage. Battery is its strong selling point. It gives 2 days on a normal use.

"
"

  Face lock is not working properly, batter life is good but takes 4-5 hours for full charge,Low light images are of poor quality and most disappointing thing is that it doesn't have applock and if you download S secure from galaxy store than it won't even notify for new messages if you lock that application with S secure.

"
"

  I'm reviewing this phone to take part in contest to win samsung level. But,  I'd say I'm at least satisfied with the phone though it seems a little overpriced comparing to other brands. But,  in current scenario of boycotting chinese product I had left only this option. I payed more in the name of patriotism. I'd  like appreciating and supporting  samsung to plant manufacturing plants in India and to not violate privacy polocies. And, try to delivery phones at low budget if possible.Regards,Jil Mehta(I.T. Engineer)

"
"

  Worst mobile, hang problem observed after 5 days of purchase.Many time fingerprint scanner not working and face unlock working 5/100 times..Back cover material is so cheap quality and color automatically removed at corner and sides in 7 days without back cover.Back cover also not providing with handset.Only battery is good.

"
"

  Heating issue while chargingHeating issue while gaming on 35mb gameHeating issue while using camera for 10 minutesHeating issue while calling for 20 minutesIt comes woth a long battery but it's only enough for 1 daySamsung's amazing display and touch.Good processor with poor performance. (Even not enough to run snapchat smoothly)Camera run smoothly and judge the camera quality buy yourself. (I attached a photo)

"
"

  ‚Ä¢ Money's worth.‚Ä¢ Amazing performance.‚Ä¢ Vibrant display quality.‚Ä¢ Budget friendly stuff with this cost.‚ñ° But the courier team handling the product totally disappointed, the stuff almost messed inside the boxes and slightly cracked one side of box, As my conclusion is lack of knowledge about the product inside.‚óè Amazon please categorize the product with ranking of budget to deliver the product to customers, I assumed to presume next time it won't happen it again.

"
"

  Samsung has provided a real Monster in my budget. I am very happy with Galaxy M21. This phone gives best specifications and best performance at a good price. I can expect 5 years smooth service from Galaxy M21 with no doubt. Don't compare this phone with other brands. After all this is Samsung Galaxy mobile, none can match with Samsung's end users experience, reliability and security.

"

  Wrtting a review after 8 days of use the battery  life ""khoda pahad nikla  chuha"" 6000mah battery perform like 3000mahFast charge is like going on slow motion for 100% battery  charging taking 2hours and 100 % charging use only for  8 hours continue  use .camera is good but not working in low light. Fingerprint and face reader work perfectly.

"
"

  Best phone in this rangeLikeBattery life awesome aprox 2 days in normal useCamera hi good, but wide angle lense is much better if it is 12 MPType C port good.Super Amalod display is awesomeAndroid 10 QDislikeNo back cover in boxMaximum charger support 15 watt, inclide in box, ai try with 30 watt charger but it's not supportedIf a stock Android UI available than this is much better

"
"

  Review after one monthPiece of garbage sold by samsung, keeps turning on and off more than five times a day (auto restart and optimization settings are off).Built quality is crappy.Takes forever to charge.Now after one month my screen is gone, Service center says it's because of overcharging and they can't cover it in warranty, so I have to pay 6700 for new screen.Once had issues in my MI phone center fixed that for me in warranty without asking for reason.

"
"

  The ohone is very good in everything. the fingerprint sensor & the face unlock sensor is very fast that it can unlock in 0.17 seconds. the battery is very big that you can use it 2 whole day with gaming experiance but it has one drawback that the charger is only 15watt if the charger should be 22watt or 30 watt then it is very good in all things. camera is superb with 403 ppi which makes it very clear quality. it also comes with a superb processor of exynos .overall the m21 is superb phone in specifications or also in a low range.

"
"

  While memory and storage are good at the price the phone is available, I was disappointed on battery performance front. May be I run too many applications on my phone, but that is the reason I went for M21 with 6000 battery capacity rating. The fully charged mobile runs only for 9 to 10 hrs. Then I have to again charge. Also the charger is not compatible with the other android phone chargers.

"
"

  It‚Äôs really great...So far it‚Äôs meeting all the expectations.Go For it.Kudos to Amazon.For fast and efficient delivery.But what i‚Äôll suggest it.Send a code to our email or sms...So that we cam show that to the delivery guy to get the product...like some companies are doing.It is much safer that way...both for delivery guy and the consumer.

"
"

  As mentioned by samsung this phone is totally a monster. Super battery life that easily lasts 2 days, it has an excellent camera which is better than what we get in most budget phones. The processor is also quite fast. The only thing that I don't like is the charging time, it normally take around 2.5-3.5 hours to completely charge from 0-100. Samsung should provide support for more than 15watts fast charge for the massive battery of this phone.To a conclusion, the phone is awesome you'll fall in love with it

"
"

  I have been using this phone regularly for the last two months. I have really fallen in love with it. It has excellent features including a great camera. A behemoth battery that is good for two days for my kind of usage. The best thing about it is its user interface that is quite user friendly and far ahead of its competition. The preloaded Samsung Note is a great application, very easy to use and quite useful.

"
"

  I have purchased Samsung m21 6gb 128gb from amazon i got the mobile delivery in 20-22 days. I like to submit a very honest review abt the phone after a month nowThis smart phone is not at allhas any smartness. The touch of the phone is very poor and slow. Phone has a heating problem while  charging and during call. Very slow processor. The wire of charger is too short to charge the phone u need to keep the phone near tothe plug only.Company hasnot even provided the handsfree and not even a back cover

"
"

  camera quality is bestbattery life is not great as advertised by samsung needs more improvement not coming two daysfinger print is very speeddisplay is awesomegreat speed ram 6 gb,  128 gb ok  but  battery not good  6 thousand mah  very  funny  one day lasts

"
"

  Finger print sensor is very slow most of the times. Camera quality is definitely not up to the mark,  Redmi camera will definitely do better. I chose this model for the battery life which really disappointed me. I don't use mobile much other than for few basic stuffs like what's app banking etc of max 2 hours per day but still need to charge mobile everyday.Just go with the brand if you really want brand name to avoid CHINA product, by the way it's Made in India

"
"

  I have both airtel and jio. I live in bangalore. With my redmi y2 I was getting 10 MBPS download and upload very easily. With this phone I'm getting ~3 MBPS download and 0.5 MBPS upload. I've tried everything. I did research and found that this is a well known problem. I wish I knew this before I bought this phone

"
"

  It is definitely a good device which you can opt for this price range. Especially the 6000 mah battery and AMOLED display makes this phone worth. The only issue I noted is with the charging time which is almost 2.4 hrs, but considering the backup, its still negligible.I felt like face ID reads a lil slower in low light and finger print scanner works better.Totally, the device is worth for the price of 12,699(N.B: I am not a gamer so not tried that part)

"
"

  Battery is really good as well as the size is slim and suitable for a proper grip... the memory is also sufficient ... the only disappointment is the camera, i have been using lenevo phn since many years and this is my first samsung experience... it seems to be dastically degraded ... overall a good budget and usable phn...

"
"

  Great mobile i have seen ever in medium  price. Camera is excellent  with 48mp in back and 20 mp in front. Amoled  display and 6000mah battery it takes day and night to drain full charge. this mobile available in two colors these are midnight blue and raven black. availabl in 4gb or 6gb ram and 64gb or 128gb rom. in the box handset comes  with 15 watt type c fast charger.this mobile is great for playing games also. Could speed is excellent. it contains biometric  security also(fingerprint&facelock).

"
"

  Its amazing to have the Samsung Galaxy M21. Its all day monster battery of 6000 mAh is  amazing and the Super AMOLED huge waterdrop notched display is so eye soothing and vivid.The Exynos 9611 processor keeps track of every process so that it runs so smooth and the main highlight of this smartphone... The 48 MP beast camera is just so fine and crystal clear.I recommend this smartphone as a budget friendly and fully advance featured.These are some shots taken from the Samsung Galaxy M21 48 MP Triple rear camera...

  Review after 30 days1. Battery - 5/52. Display - 4.5/53. Design - 3.5/54. Camera: 4/55. OS - 4/56.Finger print reader and face lock - 3.5/57.Processor and performance - 3.5/58. Charging :2.5/5No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone9. Accessories : 2/5No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard.. So order backcover and tempered glassVerdict: For this price Its the best choice for a non gamer

"
"

  Rear finger point sensor is very difficult if you have a small palm.. as the size of phone is big one get irritated to everytime hold the phone by both the hands and then use fingerprint sensor. When switch on dual sim standby the sim in either slot automatically stops working. Everytime i have to turn on and off for both sim to work simultaneously. In last i have disabled the dual sim standby functionality.

"
"

  Fingerprint scanner  Very good because if you unintentionally touch the scanner it doesn't unlocks rather a small force is required which helps while taking phone out of pocketCamera  Although you get a bit lower MP camera in this price range in India but Samsung's various camera features like focus and quick analysis of type of photo taken, helps to take nice pics. Stability in the video is also amazingBattery lifeWell when you have such a high MAh battery from Samsung you can have no question at all

"
"

  Reviewing after 7 days of usageProsDisplay-10/10 no other competition in this price ..Battery - 9/10 quite good easily gave 1 day backup.. depends on user to userCamera rear- 10/10 impressed by the performance of the cameraConsCheap build qualityIt has some network issuesFingerprint is not so fast as compare too other Chinese deviceOverall it is value for money for a non heavy gamer like meKudos to Amazon for delivering before the estimated delivery date

  It is the Monster, batary life is awesome, display quality it at notch, performance is good if you are a regular 6-8 hour user, camera is cool enough....You can go with 4Gb ram Varient if you decided to buy M21, but if you are going to choose 6Gb then please go with M31...Con's - Plastic back, with fingerprint magnet, though if you are going to use it with cover, then it doesn't matter for you...Go With It !!

"
"

  1. Even with hudge battery , not giving very good back. Max one day with normal uses.2. My phone crashes automatically 3 to 4 times in last one month.3. Camera get click and sometime few pics getting processed as complete black.4. Call not getting picked or cancelled in one swipe on the touch button appear while getting an incoming callThe last three points are serious defects of this phone and from a brand like Samsung not acceptable at all.

"
"

  I have been using M21 since June 2020. This mobile is awesome,  I couldn't get such quality and extra features in such low cost branded Mobile. Camera quality is fabulous, sound quality is amazing and dual social media account features is cherry on the cake. I have been managing my personal and official work from this single mobile. Earlier, I used to use two mobiles and had to carry everywhere.I would like to extend my gratitude to Samsung for this wonderful piece. Thank you Samsung üòä‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

  I loved this phone. It is the best in range.1)Thumbs up to the 6000mah long battery. It allows you to game, watch videos and do a lot of things whole day long.2)Camera is also great. In good lighting conditions it captures great photos. Also It has many options like pro mode, live focus, slow-mo and super slo-mo.3)It has got the latest security update and the the biometrics are also working great.Collectively it is a beast in the its range and it is a must but product.

"
"

  1)  It shows some heating problem during online working and charging.2) It contains a numbers of useless apps.3) It doesn't contain individual app lock.4) It nearly forced to sign in in samsung account.5) Camera is very good.6)sound is not too good.7) It's ok as it quick.

  This device is not so fast as it should be. Within two months of purchase, yesterday I have to factory reset the phone as Google play store was not opening for last two days. Now it's just ok. No other problem is faced till now.

"

  ¬†GREAT SMARTPHONE IN BUGET AND ALSO GREAT BATTARY PERFORMANCE I LIKE THE CAMERA QUALITY OF THIS SMARTPHONE ITS REALLY AMAZING THANKS A LOT DEAR SELLER ITS VERY PERFECTLY DESIGNED PHONE

"
"

  It's been 15 days since I am using this phone,To be very honest this phone is a good deal at this price.The camera quality is amazing and have excellent adjustment feature.Talking about the battery life, yes it lasts a day if you charge 100%. Even after a day I am left with 30% battery.The amoled screen is commendable and such a great experience while using.The only problem I faced while using this phone is that it sometimes hangs. It stops working suddenly. May be because I excessively use it.

"
"

  Great Battery, Great screen, headphone jack, memory card...all missing from my pixel 3. Yrs camera is very average..which is expected..got this for Dad on father's day. Remember to clear samsung bloatware ..tons of useless pre installed apps. Just delete those.

  I am using samsung galaxy m21 this product middle class super phone value of money and camera quality is very good fingerprint reader is very fast and battery charging is slowly and full charge is 2 days came  gaming is fast and downloading is very after 3 hours phone is heating gaming middle and lower budget good value for money camera 5-5 ‚≠ê fingerprint reader 5-4.5  value for money 5-5 ‚≠ê

"
"

  I bought this for my mother, considering Samsung has a very easy to operate and user friendly UI. The phone simply stands out and exceeds all expectations given the price. Must say, a 5 star buy! 2 thumbs up to Samsung.

"
"

  Bought this phone a month back. This is my first Samsung phone(normally I prefer xiaomi).So far so good. I loved the look and feel and have taken pictures and videos. Looks fairly good. If you are planning a phone within price13k it is a good option. Battery lasts for 2 full days after a full charge even after extensive use of hotspot. One problem that I noticed is sometimes ( only once or twice it has occurred ) the sim is not detected, but that gets automatically fixed on restarting  the phone. On the whole, a product worth it's price.

"
"

  Awesome mobile in every Corner. I suggest go for M21 best battery backup, best camera quality, I am also using MI note 8 pro but mi is the worse mobile because camera 64 MP but quality like 2 mp display is also worse, video recording worse over and all Samsung is the best Mobile. It is my open challenge Samsung is not compare any Chinese mobile.

"
"

  Mobile not worked at all, touchscreen is faulty.Disappointed to see that new mobile is not working at all, big question on quality checks.Already requested for replacement.

"
"

  Worst experience, samsung mobile phone quality has depreciated. On my 1st order it was a defected product with over heating and speaker issue. I raised a replacement request i got a new phone, after one week its the new replacement one speaker issue has started. Amazon please verify the quality of the products. It is very dissapointing when you pay 15k to 16k on a samsung mobile and in return you get such a poor quality. Samsung is the worst brand for mobile phone. This is the last time i am buying samsung mobile and that too from Amazon.

  Camera 2 API not supported as it's a exynos based device. One ui gives a premium feel great screen and battery. Best value for money. Takes lot of time to charge but even after 2 matches of pubg consumes only 2-3% battery. I hope Samsung provides features like edge lighting and edge panel in M series too. It's a software thing anyways.

  Best budget phone.In market many phones are there but this one is different. It is really a monster. Most exsiting feature of the phone is camera.Camera review :we can feel original 48 megapixe camera with best sensors.Photo and video stabilization is well balanced. Really a monster camera.we can make our own screen saver.Battery:6000 mah battery doesn't feel much weight.if we keep full charge it will definitely last for 8 hours on peak usage also.You can buy this phone with no doubt for daily use.

"
"

  This phone is otherwise good and value for money. But one major issue I'm experiencing is that my HP laptop is not being able connect to this phone's hotspot.  I searched on google and found out that not only me, many others are also experiencing the same problem. I hope Samsung comes up with an update to resolve the issue.

"

  Samsung m21 is not badBattery backup is very bad and vainCamera quality is very niceYou can not play games in this device like pubg free fireAnd not give back cover and glassAnd charger lead is very small so please don't buy this productAnd don't buy this product for good battery because it's battery is a garbage

"
"

  Samsung mentions it has dolby audio, but doesnt have a dolby atmos control panel like in lenovo or other dolby supported phones. With a careful reading I found out that it has ""DOLBY SUPPORT"" not ""DOLBY ENABLED"" which means any apps that have dolby support or contents with dolby audio would be supported on this device. By default this device does not have dolby audio. This is cheating!!!

  Today is 8 day of purchase my product samsung m21 mobile and touch is not working and mobile is hang from 3 hr and  I am try to connect with team noone give me response worst product for me for ever please help me

  Worst Samsung phone Buying experience.  Very poor network signal strength. The sim when used in my old phone ( VIVO)  has better network and internet  speed.But M21 and M 30S Very weak signal . So Please Don't Waste Your Money . I Don't have many options To buy phones  so I bought it .Bad experience,  I waste my Money , please Don't waste Your money .I personally Experience network problem in M30S and M21 .

"

  I love the samsung ecosystem and big fan of ONEUI. This phone is what Samsung  promised  us a monster . Lens are amazing and the shots have beautiful color capture.  The sAmoled display give u a smooth experience  to ur eyes as well as saves battery. With 6000mAh battery im using it for alomst 18+ hours  without charge which is an essential  feature for me. The phone is bit heavy for me but prolly not for u just  188g. The touch is smooth and fingerprint works blazing fast. I would have loved it more if Samsung ship it with designer backs.

"
"

  This is the best smartphone to have if you want a good battery amazing display and camera. I tested m21 camera with the rivals of m21 and the end result on m21 camera gives better optimised than any other rivals and the battery life is excellent it gives me 1 day of full battery without charging in evening. If you want to game with this phone it's good it can keep up it's performance it's good but it's not bad. Summing it is a great phone having great display battery and camera you can buy this phone without thinking 2nd time.

"
"

  The most pathetic phone ever. It‚Äôs performance is poor. The screen got cracked while charging a week after purchase. And they won‚Äôt take it back. Now the battery is discharging very quickly. And I feel like I have wasted my money completely. Don‚Äôt buy this or any other Samsung phone.

"
"

  Pros - battery last for one day till night , no problem after heavy usageCamera - camera is good in price range not awesomeProcessor- Good but not for gameplay like pubg..don buy it heavy game lovers.Cons-Weight is more than other smartphone , looks heavy when take in hand.Little hanging problems when uses many app one time because not have excellent processer..only for moderate use.Comes with 15 volt charger not and charge full phone in 2.5 hours.

"
"

  It's been over a month now I am using this device. To be honest I forget sometime that I am not using a Samsung Flagship phone but a mid range phone.The UI, the Camera, the Haptc, Battery almost everything is as good as any flagship phone.  They have used a Xynos instead of Snapdragon to cut the cost but it never fails to deliver on user experience.For a mid range phone, it's an absolute monster. Over all satisfied and would recommend 10/10

"
"

  M21 is very good mid range phone display infinity super AMOLED U is ultimate 6000mah bettary is good for long usage front camera 20mp was not grate back camera 48mp was better don't buy it for higher end games like pubg kind of games main issue of this phone is heating problemIf Samsung fix this in next update it's for better

"
"

  Great package you should buy itcamera display and battery really perform wellAnd for an 12699 rs. Its a great deal but only disappointing that company does not offer backcase in box. So u should spend more bucks to buy but after all its great u get excellent Ui and ram management.And I does not found so issue with its polycarbobate back its quiet decent for all types of hands (small,big) it is so light to handle  .And in hands it quiet interestingDeffinately u can buy .. U get great package in under 13 k...

"
"

  Samsung display and battery is excellent and camera is  very good but not excellent and processor is very bad so the ph is not for any gammer. I have no idea why samsung doesn't provide all features in his all smartphones as samsung M series has no knox security,no secure folder,no samsung pay etc.

"
"

  I want a budget phone from very long. I was using Mi which was ok but I wanted  something  refreshing . I head good  reviews  of Samsung  phone  I did lots of investigation  on this m21 model  .I would tell its simply  amazing the display, battery life all amazing inspite of this battery  still it's very sleek.I am very happy

"
"

  When there was only one rear camera, Samsung was the awesome phone for taking pictures.Now there are 3 rear cameras but not much clarity. Rest everything is good except camera.Who are buying this phone mainly for Camera pls look for other models/brand.Who are looking for performance, battery and other options can buy this one.

"
"

  Over heating problem. Very badly heating handset M-21 during charging as well as at the time talking & surfing after removing from charger. Battery drainage quickly.I received the handset yesterday & bad experiencing about the product. Also camera at the time of slow motion click is not goody. It is flickering at the time of shooting slow-motion videos.

"
"

  Overall phone quality is ok.Battery life is good as capacity is 6000 mAH. But is takes time to get the battery charged.Fast changing option is give but only 15w charger provided, which supposed to be 25 w or 30 w..Camera is ok. Not bad..There is no internet speed indicator...No overheating problems..The processor is not snapdragon processor...Overall phone performances is good.

"
"

  Worst Product. I replaced one M21 after it failed to boot and over heating. I asked amazon for an option to replace Galaxy M21 with another mobile of similar or even higher price other than Samsung, but they refused. They sent me another one M21 instead. The sound quality of calls is pathetic. Battery life is good though. But without proper sound quality of calls, not sure what's the use of this mobile. Bad experience from Samsung and also from Amazon customer care.

"
"

  As per the price range camera quality is good. It have a pro option, you can do your own settings like ISO, aperture etc. Battery life is very good. Look is also very good. It's better than any other chinese mobile brand.

"
"

  Amazing all rounder  . It's perfect for me because of its amazing super amoled fhd+ display which gives amazing video experience and doesn't use more battery.for normal users it would give 2 days battery life.i am a hardcore user still it gives me 1 and a half day battery life. I need to charge this only once a day.during lockdown days my phone is working all day i am watching series and playing games still it gives a wonderful battery life.Its best battery and display in this price category

"
"

  The worst camera....48mp should have allowed various different aspect ratios....but in this its bound to 3:4....even the quality is not meeting expectations...super slo mo video is bound to just 8 seconds....really not acceptable...you can't add contact photo if the number is saved in the SIM card you can only add contact photo when the number is saved in the phone...sound not upto the mark.. .had a lot higher expectations

"
"

  Battery- superDisplay-superSpeed - superSound - superFront Camera - not good quality,  if you are a selfie-coholic person then this camera will disappoint you.Back camera photo - photo quality is not at all good . I am missing my previous phone which was having less megapixels came than this phone but photo was far better and creastel clear. This phone photos are kind of hazzy.Back camera video - not so happy .

"
"

  Could not have asked for anything better from Samsung when you look for an alternative from the crowded chinese phones. I should say samsung has done an absolute good job with this mobile. I delayed writing my review as i wanted to ensure i take enough time to test it and with these many months usage i would definitely give it a thumps up. If you are someone who is looking for an alternative from mi, oppo, realme and al other cheap handsets.. this is th mob to go..

"
"

  Its 2 day using this phone. Face unlocking is quite slow. And with fi connectivity is also not good. But battery in good with fast charge. All over the mobile is nice as the price. But expect to much from this.

"
"

  Ya it's good ...battery life is much better and good camera quality and have new feature like steaty video and in our budget this phone is much better than mi phone and we must compare this with mi or Redmi phone ,&we see that is phone is much better  in good budget but there is draw back tha network quality  should be must better and latest andoride version 10 is there, and we can also play pubg and may more game in 3d and better quality .any way this phone is much better than China company and perefable in our budget.

"
"

  What a camera, what a battery, what a display,Dont know still y people complaint about samsung proccessor, but as per me this proccessor is the best,Exynos 9611 is the best proccessor, the way how it handle imaging proccess, the way it handle batter consumtion, the way it handle gaming perfomanceReally best.People please dnt go on negetive review, compare to chinese mobiles, this is best.

"
"

  A great phone for this price........ phone with huge battery and very nice super amoled screen and with a lot of built in features.->Camera quality is brilliant....->fingerprint reader is very fast->Audio output via 3.5 mm jack is very good as it supported supports Dolby atmos.Hence Overall It's A Great Value pack from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone.

"
"

  ¬†Terrific!Dude is worth every penny...Superb octa gaming processor,has gyro,can play pubg in high graphicsEpic cameraAnd that's it what else do you want in a phoneOh forgot about the fingerprint sensor,once a blue moon you have to manually answer the other way of opening the phone..(like pattern)Hope you liked this comment.

"

  There is so much network issue in this phone. It doesn't catch network properly. The same network on any other phone works well on 4g whereas on the same time in this phone will be 2g or hardly 3g. There are lots of videos on YouTube regarding this unresolvable issue in this phone. I would recommend to not buy this phone.

"
"

  Excellent product.... very good camera quality.... awesome display.... very good looking.... but VERY POOR ADAPTOR.... bought it on 24th August.... adaptor stopped functioning from 3rd September.... damaged.... I don't have any idea about the warranty of the Adaptor ( if any ) .It's horrible to think that, a company like Samsung manufacture such a poor quality product.

"
"

  Its performance is not as 6000mah battery it act as a 4500mah..For a regular usage of youtube and rare chats it survive for a day only. Samsung cheating as a monster battery but performance is same its previous smartphones.camera, display ,multitasking ,games  are ok....great Disappointed on battery

"
"

  Best buy ..used for 2 weeks and still the battery keep u busy without charging for more than 2 days for non gaming ...for gaming u can use it a day without charging ...best battery mobile..camera ok in this rangeAudio output through headphone is good ...go for it ....nice phone with good specs and best display for this price rangeBattery is the overall turn overLast more than 2 daysCamera and display are superb go for it

"
"

  Absolutely  amazing  built quality I have been using this from 2 months now. The camera quality is just exceptional for photography, videos could be better on selfie cameraHaven't faced any issue in performance till nowIn nutshell, it's a perfect choice in the price range I really love it, has been a very smooth experience

"
"

  If you are planning to buy a new mobile for yourself or your loved one, then Samsung mobiles are amongst the best mobile options to choose from.Samsung Galaxy M21 smartphone runs on Android v10 (Q) operating system. The phone is powered by Octa core (2.3 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A73 + 1.7 GHz, Quad core, Cortex A53) processor. It runs on the Samsung Exynos 9 Octa 9611 Chipset. It has 4 GB RAM and 64 GB internal storage.Buil quality upsets me ,it be a lit betterAt the end it's an excellent mobile phone

"
"

  Don't mean to generalise but my phone stopped working (went into a reboot loop and then stopped) in just about 2 months. Have written multiple times to Samsung Customer Service and to Amazon, but no response yet.... probably they are not bothered. Called their customer service.... they asked to visit service centre in these times of lockdown... anyways, checked but informed that service centre closed.... no alternate solution.... still waiting..... Hope they do something to keep their reputation - both Samsung and Amazon

"
"

  I bought this phone for my father, it's pretty decent if you're not a heavy user, battery is juice enough for a day, camera is good for the money.You're gonna face a bit of problem with the processor, but what you are getting is not a deal breaker.

"
"

  Finger print sensor is somewhat slow and their is so much signal issues. No proper signal,only 2 bar signal will come,doesn't matter which sim place.Display is excellentBattery : in normal use,whole 6000 mah battery will be completed in 1 day.And I dont play any game.Camera is good.

"
"

  Scope for optimization in the camera.Else it is flawless in every sense. OS OPTIMIZATION, GUI, GAMING, DAY TO DAY USAGE all 10 on 10 except indoor camera shots 8 out of 10 elae camera is 10 on 10 too.Much better than all the phones in this segment.

"
"

  I was overall happy with the phone but on 11th day after usage, its touch keypad started hanging... It doesnt respond at all at times. Unfortunately, the replacement window closed and I am stuck with the faulty phone.

"
"

  I recently by this Samsung M21 from this buyer..unfortunately the phone is not work after update.. and I'm visited nearest Samsung service centre for service.. but they told me this is a faulty product .. the phone is simply having major issues  ..This is the first time something like this has happened with one of your product.I am hoping that you may be able to send me a replacement product...Thanking you advance.Please contact me as soon as possible.

"
"

  Review after use for 2 months. Excellent  Phone and  easy to  customize  Samsung  UI.Not used it for gaming  though  for daily  users  ,no issues at all.Doesnt hang,no heating and fast in tasks.Some improvements  could be  voice over speakers  especially  during  video  calls and  gesture as palm swipe for screenshots  will make it  beat phone.

"
"

  There is big problem in these mobile it‚Äôs gets very hot while charging.When surfing and watching videos gets very hot specially on top side it feels it will be explode any time not happy with Samsung

"
"

  Samsung M21 comes with Amoled display with Full HD resolution. The mobile was very lighter in weight though it has 6000mah battery capacity. Good Battery life.Always on Display.Cons:Position of the volume button was too High.It takes more time for full charging

"
"

  Absolute nonsense!!!Broke with just a slip though have put standard quality tempered glass both back and front. With a cover as well!!!Battery life is absolute piss! Doesn't charges soon enuff and discharges with in 2hour of heavy working which should not b the case with a new phone.Don't know if the problem is with the seller or the manufacturer but had high expectation from this didn't do well!Would not suggest to buy! You can get the same or even better phones for lesser price as well.

"
"

  Pros:-Good display-Better batteryCons:-Sound quality average-Night shots are useless-Plenty of bloatware-Processor not much good-Back design is not good

"
"

  M21 is a very nice phone considering its price . The main highlights are the long lasting battery life , fantastic camera and highly customisable and very useful user interface . This comes with a little bloatwares also.The processor feels slightly outdated but not a headache for everyday multitasking or a nongamer .Camera is super awesome ...some unique features will surely please you.

"
"

  I like the camera and battery. battery life is very good. like normal uses backup is 2 days. And the camera is great.I take many photos, all over the camera quality is satisfactory. And the big thing is the AMOLED display. So if I see the video and doing a task, my display experiences are very good.And processer is good. I have no issue about  phone slow.I dislike this phone sound quality. I don't like sound quality.So overall all think all very well.

"
"

  Excellent product.Screen quality is superior as compared to Chinese models.Samsung display is top notch and is like a benchmark for other brans.Camera is also a great.Built quality could have been a bit better, specially the back pannel. But it's fine for the given price.Overall a great product from Samsung.

"
"

  in thise network issue is too much I request to replace still they did not proceed itNow I got the product today after replacing it has same problem as previously,mu bsnl sim is not supporting in this phone properlyAnd I ALREADY CHECK ANOTHER SAMSUNG DEVICE  A20 WHICH IS ALMOST 1 YEAR OLD  IT SUPPORT SEEMLESS WAY, IT DOESN'T SHOW ANY PROBLEMSI THING THIS REVIEW IS HELPFUL.  I AM TECH PERSON. I OBSERVED THAT SAMSUNG NOT PROVIDING KNOX SECURITY IN M SERIES...

"
"

  I have been using it for last 2 weeks. Superb phone under 15k. High speed fingerprint reader. Good camera quality with shot suggestion. Huge battery which lasts for 1.5-2 days with heavy usage. Bestin segment Fantastic screen with superb amoled display.  Can play pubg without any lags in smooth+ultra mode for more than 9 hours in a single charge. Fantastic phone. Only a problem which I'm facing is, perfect screenguard is not available which covers edge to edge of the screen. Anyways best phone in this segment.

"
"

  Don't buy this product. The fingerprint reader is titled a little and not in a proper place so there is space where dust can collect overtime  . The space between the corner of the screen and the phone has a small gap which are unsealed , there are traces of fine plastic like thread oozing out from this gap The 3.5mm slot produces irritating noises and produce a humming effect whenever connected to any type of earphones . I think in was given a reject product due to scarcity in supply due to COVID-19

"
"

  Samsung didn't not disappoint me when I was looking for a new Samsung phone after I lost my Samsung J 30 in an accident.I got a wonderful value for money Samsung phone in the form of M21It's having 6000mah 64GB ROM & 4GB RAM with an outstanding 48mp triple camera when I wasn't in a position to spend more than Rs.15000 for a phone.After 3 months of usage, am finding no faults with this real MONSTER phone.Felt this launch of the phone at the apt time by Samsung just for me.Thank you SAMSUNG

"
"

  Overall its a nice product from samsung.Camera is really good in daylight. But not very appreciable in daylight.The display of the phone is awesome.Fingerprint reader is taking a bit to unlock, but its overall good.Even the battery capacity is huge, the life is not that I expected. The 15 W charger takes very long to charge and drains comparitively very fast.Thus, in this price range, galaxy m21 is a good option with a wonderful display quality and camera.

"
"

  This is really a monster. It is very smooth and fast. It has a very long battery life. I really felt love with this. The camera is very satisfying. It captures the wonderful moments very fast and clear. Every specification Samsung wrote in the description is truth and i suggest this pjone very much. The 6gb ram and smamoled display gives smooth experience.

"
"

  I am using this phone since a month and I am very much satishfied with it. Its processor is good and never hangs. There are many beautiful camera options for both selfie and back camera photography.The only issue I find is the manual control in camera. It do not have optio to select manual focus or shutter speed.Rest all is good including sound, graphics and battery backup.

"
"

  Honest review after looking and using one day , Display excellent, Battery excellent,Built quality average,charging time average as it have 6000 mah battery, multimedia experience good,Yes in 14k phone cover needed in the box but not available , screen quality gorilla glass 3 ok because it's require tempered glass.

"
"

  Battery charging time is too long. Phone getting heating up. Poor battery performance. Never expected from samsung like brand.

"
"

  A decent phone with a decent  battery  specially  in this price range... but it's heats in heavy use & slightly  warms if you charge for long hours.In the camera department,  everything's is pretty good except macros ... focus is not so stable. Manual camera mode to focus objects should have been better .

"
"

  The best part of this device is the display.. Really vibrant and punchy colours with a lot of options for further configuration. Battery life is good. Charging time is also okay. Camera performance in daylight is really impressive, average at night. Cpu performance is okay but not great for heavy usage. This phone is more dedicated for entertainment purposes like videos, movies, web series etc.Only downside is the retro style plastic backpanel. Samsung should definitely look at this matter.

"
"

  The features are all great but the charging sucks... it took about 4 hours to charge fully for the first week... and after 10 days, just for 50% charge it took 3 hours... Fortunately, I had raised the complain within a week ... Amazon has assured to take it back and return the money

"
"

  The device is Heating up and there is no proper replacement or return option.If you are genuine, u should give such options to ur users and not force them to use your faulty product.The mobile gets too heated while charging & other times also it is hot and disturbing to keep it on ur ears during call.! Wat to do with this mobile seriously..!Very disappointed with this product.Also they use a diagnostic app to check it, which is very inaccurate.Please be genuine & refund it.Please

"
"

  Best quality mobile phone.Camera is powerful to capture clear picture.Battery life is so long as per expectFinger print reader is so fineIt's is a quality phone in all section.

"
"

  What I like-Display is top notch. If you keep Mi phones and Samsung, you will look now the difference-Camera is very good.No non sense camera and camera default app-Lot of customisation possible-No bloatware. Even the Samsung pre installed apps can be un installed. Compared to spamming Mi devices, this is lot betterWhat I don't like-Samsung UI is not so intuitive.You need time to get familiarise. Usability needs improvement

"
"

  Well it has been a few weeks now since i started using this phone. So far i loved it. BATTERY is outstanding. FINGERPRINT READER is awesome. CAMERA QUALITY is damn good. Well build. Best display experience so far. And it has everything a person needs. Gaming experience is also damn good. No heating problems. Two charging modes are available. One is normal and another one is fast charge. Battery lasts really long and u can work all day and put the phone om charge at night. So far m satisfied with this product. Thanks

"
"

  After around 40 hours usesx its hanging while typing and browsing any app.  It's taking more time to charge battery full and battery is draining fast.Ther is an option to exchange your device but it it's not being processed.I am trying to connect to amozon custemer representative from last 2 days but it couldn't be connected. Nobody is ther to listen my problem. I just calling whole day to customer care.Very very poor service if it's happening continuous ly people throw you out of the market.

"
"

  Wanted to buy a phone for pubg and watching movies, in a tight budget. Pubgs runs very nicely. Also watching movies is very pleasent on this amoled screen.My fam was so impressed with this phone that we have 3 m21 in our phone now.I would recommend this in a range less than 15k.Also the bettry is so good that you wont even think about charging before eod in any case. 20% battry will always be left.

"
"

  Got the delivery in 1 day. Appreciate your supply chain network. The product is great. Looks stunning. Screen is bright and vivid. Love it very much. Camera quality is a bit low but I think that's something I'll have to do with camera settings. I'll try to figure it out. Battery is excellent. Overall a must have product. No need to spend huge amount of money on expensive mobile. This mobile has great features at low price. Strongly recommend.

"
"

  I've been using this phone for almost 3 months and I would say the phone hasn't dissappointed me. I was not a huge fan a Samsung phones but this phone changed my mindset. This phone fulfills all your basic needs that you would have from a smartphone. If you don't want to spend too much and yet get all the features M21 is enough for you. Samsung UI, battery life, camera performance, smoothness, display are all really good. I don't play games so cant really comment about that aspect.

"
"

  This phone has the worst camera possible to be put in a device. To give you a perspective i was using mi 5a which had 5 mp front camera and that still clicked better pictures than this 20 mp device. I will strictly suggest you to not to waste your money on this phone. Also when i approached amazon they denied me any kind of help. Buy products from Amazon only if you're sure you will not have to consider return option.

"
"

  They are selling duplicate product. I purchased this phone recently from amazon but speaker problem, finger print sensor problem,  battery is not 6000 mah just like 3500 mah. Return policy has elapsed and problem has occurred. Please don't buy this kind of faulty product. Waste of money.

"
"

  Good... Battery, screen, camera all are very good.. Not excellent but in 13999 everthings ok... Only one thing lack.. Processor... Samsung should used Q. Snadragon 712 AE Or 720 G processor and back panel plastic is average quality so fell  heat mobile on back panel

"
"

  Wow!! "" Whatta"" display. The provided super AMULED display is impressive! Great camera quality. Even you get a professional mode in camera dedicated to professional photographers. It takes less than 3 hours(a long time as per me) to charge. But the battery life is great The finger peint scanner is very fast and d if you are looking for mobiles below in 12000 to 15000  range, this is the best mobile you can get!! But the 4 Gb one doesnot support wifi calling.

"
"

  The phone performance is very poor. Feel cheated by Samsung. For such a huge price we have got a substandard product. The 48 MP camera is performing like a 4 MP camera. It‚Äôs hardly three months since we bought this phone and the phone keeps on hanging every now and then. The phone also starts getting heated when it‚Äôs hanging. I would like to complain to customer grievances forum for delivery of substandard products. A big no to Samsung products. The company is cheating its customers

"
"

  I would very like to say that this phone is the best phone in 14kYou can surely buy this phoneIt's very clean without any addsIt's display is fabulous all the colour are looking so realJust ausome phoneI watched in you tube that it's not gonelook good but trust me it's so good lockingOne and only con is that it takes near about 3hrs easily,but this is very minour con actually it's under 14k so it's not muchThank you, hope so you got some help from me .....Ayush Roy

  Ui is simple  and best in the market with uninstallable 3-4 bloatware.Battery- life is lesser than expected  with 6000 Mah monster  ..Display- superb as expected with Samsung  AmoledCamera- fine but ..low ligt photographyis not up to mark.. software  need to improveGaming- not checked..not interested  in mobile  gamingBuilt- plastic (poly carbonate)Most importantly  non ChineseOverallBest in price  segment9/10- previously8/10 after price hike

"
"

  Such a bogus product. Got this on Aug 20, 2020 for my father and it was such a waste of money. The screen was not working forget about reviewing the phone I couldn't even get inside the phone. And Amazon people are so great they won't come pick-up the product, they won't provide refund. So basically it's a trap you would get yourself into. Your money but you don't have the option of returning the phone and opting for other even after knowing how bad it is.

"
"

  M21 is the best handset for me because its battery life is going 2 days on internet. Fingerprint sensor is excellent and also Face unlock  (also best experience in night). 48mp main camera is awesome clicking pictures in night also best. Handset gripping is nice. I am playing PUBG 4 hour continues but phone didn't heat. Screen experience is better than others phones. Blue colour is good looking. Charging is perfect with 15 watt charger. it's take about 2.5 hour to fully charged. I appreciate to SAMSUNG for his excellent work.

"
"

  After receiving from the vendor it was working fine but after sometime  the touch screen of the left side not at all working and giving hazard. I know it no point writing reviews as the seller will not take it serious but it important matter and the poor man is suffering hope the Samsung company is listing and will support.The phone and the Amazon is supplying default productHope it rectify soon I also want a exchange on the same.Hope for positive reply on the same

"
"

  First of all I'll tell about  main highlight of this series is battery... so battery life is very good.. its last for 1 &half day for regular use after full charge. It has 6000Mah Monster battery,Because of this mobile weight more than other phone.Its pretty good design as compared to other budget range phone.Fingerprint reader is fast enough to unlock the phone.Camera quality is not that much good.Overall mobile is good for those who want more battery life.

  Its an excellent value for money with 6k batter 4gb ram and 64gb space 48mp camera all in 14k.The look and feel of the phone is like any other premium phone.Size is perfect to hold and phone is not that heavy even with so much battery

"
"

  Very standard product of samsung. Fingerprint scanner quality is much better than other, camera is good, allover that is value for money in this prize. And also as of being an Indian I don't want to give a single penny to Chinese Companies it is good for me.

  Are you guys gonna mad what you think whether you guys give us the product bad and we will be happyDisgusting about ur serviceWant new mobile phoneNor get even earphones and you give us bad qualityDon't cheat with us poor customersDisgusting with your serviceYou can clearly see in the pic there is a line on the screen and today your agent came with the new mobile and refused to take the older one.I want a new replacement at anyhowAsap

"
"

  Don't buy this. I purchased on 11th July 2020. In one month display became white and then screen form blank. Service station told me that screen has to replace . No warranty du to water drops in mobile. I have to pay Rs.6200.00 for new screen. Bettery is like 3000 mah. Better to go others brand.

"
"

  The phone lives up to the the priceThis is a pretty good phone for daily usage with 6000 mAH battery life which can keep going till 2 daysIt also has the exynos 9611 processor which is a good processor for medium gaming and daily usageThe fingerprint sensor works wellCamera quality is very goodI strongly recommend this product if you're willing to buy it

"
"

  Overall the phone quality if satisfactory except few thingsPros:-Display : GoodBattery - excellentcamera - Goodprocessing speed - goodgaming experience - satisfactoryCons :-one of the common problem that i am facing is heating up, apart from this other problems that i am facing is cant able to enter more than a single finger print, magnifier (under accessibility) automatically disable specially when you restart your phone.

"
"

  After 1 month of uses no any lags and bugsCamera is very good at this price range battery life is really  monster even I play pubg 2-3 hrs in a day it gives me 1 day full battery life....after playing heavy games....in day to day uses it is very good device and best flagship level display at this  price  range best non Chinese phone....cons- charging  times it take 2:50 hrs to full charge and cheap quality plastic  back diegin....overall it is a very  good smartphone...go for it.

"
"

  Never believe in the battery capacity. Battery life is so short. Discharging happens swiftly. 6000 mAh in this phone is well below the 5000 mAh in Moto one power. Super AMOLED display doesn't have any major difference from FHD. The comparison advertisement between super AMOLED and FHD is simply a marketing trick only. I don't recommend this phone on the basis of Battery and display. With two SIM and data ON usage will drain 1 percentage in every 2 minutes.

"
"

  I am love with this made in India product. Excellent camera quality, lovely display and the best thing maha battery backup of 6000 MAH which lasts for 24 hours under heavy usage. I am writing this review after 2 months of heavy usage. Loaded with lots of other features not available in Chinese phones.

"
"

  Heating all the time, hands are burningOthers are reasonable but price is too high for this device, call quality is clear no problem at all, no network issues as everybody says it's works fine and battery, one day full with heavy usage, my old phone was 4000 maH, i would charge once again middle of the day after i plug out in the morning but for this one, i never needed second time charge.

"
"

  Phone is good but after price increase I can't say its a value for money.Camera is good..... battery is just ok if u see as 6000mah battery....chaging is slow for this 6000mah battery.Built quality is not good.I am also facing issues while video calling by its default phone app but hoping it will be solved after software update.At last best thing of the phone....its display...just one word.... awesome.

"
"

  A genuine mobile for daily use, but not at all recommended for gaming purposes. It has been a month since I've purchased this and while playing Asphalt 8, a call came and all of a sudden, the mobile hangs off... So gamers please do avoid it.Camera quality and battery life are pretty good, apart from long charging time

"
"

  Battery life is really good.Camera is not up to the mark and the detailing is not as good as expected from a 48 MP camera. Front camera is bad. Display is excellent. Fingerprint reader is working really fast but face recognition is just good. I will recommend this product to any person who is looking for a good budget phone without a good camera.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is a worthy phone with great features loaded. Especially battery this really drives to run atleast 2-3 days.Also this device is light weight and fits to pocket smoothly. Especially i like the OneUI of samsung which delivers the professional version of android OS.Photo quality is the another highlight of the samsung m21 this is really great.I love this device. Before i was using Mi now i switched to samsung now i am experiencing the professional Experience in mobility.

"
"

  I bought samsung M21 Raven black 6GB ram, 128GB storage..this is the most amazing smartphone i have bought till now..its ""battery life"" last for 2 long days..and the superamoled ""Infinity U screen"" is just amazing..i can watch endless movies without thinking of the batttery..n i just love the ""camera quality"". The ""fingerprint reader "" is fast n works within seconds..if u r looking for good phone under 16000 i totally recommend this budget smartphone..

"
"

  Before purchase this phone I was using mi a3 but mi a3 amoled display is not sharp as Samsung super amoled display but in terms of camera gaming and battery backup mi a3 is much better then Samsung M21 while both of phones have 48 megapixel camera but believe me guys mi a3 front and back both camera is much better then Samsung M21 so if you want to buy a sharp super amoled display go with Samsung M21 and if you want better camera and glass back go with mi a3

"
"

  Opinion: I can say best phone under 17k. Made this for camera and entertainment lovers. But not for gamers. Even though it has 6GB RAM, the phone lags for few online games like PUBG..Advantages:-1. Fast fingerprint sensor.2. Very good camera.3. Not much expensive.4. Good battery with fast charger.5. Superb audio quality using Dolby atmos with headphone.Disadvantages:-1. Thicker compared to other phones.2. Slow face recognisation.3. Processor not up to the mark.

  Very owsome experince..... battery was not satisfying initially but after 5-6 cycles it was owsome ,1 more issue is there in my device only not in my friends same model i feel hang on my phone leks was seen sometimes ever during very soft usage ....I wish plz samsung can exchange my phone or solve my problem...My return policy is left till 6 june can i replace it plz answer me samsung......I am samsung user from 7 years and i am 17 years old becz i have trust on samsung but these phone not given me responce as i expacted...

"

  I bought this device Samsung Galaxy M21, 2 months ago in may 2020 from amazon for 12700rs ..So my review is after 2 month of usage.Also this is my first smartphone from samsung.Overall after using for 2 months and at this price range, I really like this phoneCamera,Fingerprint Sensor,Battery life everything is good and biggest higlight its Display...Really amazing among all smartphones present at same price range.Strongly recommend at this price good product from trusted brand samsumg.

"
"

  Performance of this mobile is average, battery no longer than expected time up to 12 hrs for minimum uses, camera is good,one ui is lagging sometimes while heavy work, overall the average phone for gaming,rough & long time of users.

  Hello everyone, When I recevied my parcel firstly I feel someone try to open my parcel there is cut in edges and used on the parcel clearly mention accept if cut on deges or tapped somehow I didn't read those line because I am hurry situation after I Recevied parcel I am facing some hitting issue and camera is not accurate what I expect apart from this everything is Great battery, sound, charging time, interface all thing so amazing

"
"

  The Display quality is amazing. I used redmi phones those phone dont have clarity on display. I love samsung display quality and finger frint sensor super sensitive. Of course the camera quality un beatable for this price range.  Under 15k , i never imagine samsung phone for this much fts. Battery life long lasting. Charging of the battery it takes time. I think good for battery life span. I like so much camera option with much clarity. Now, i became fan of samsung mobile family

"
"

  Awesome moblie by samsung at 14,000 100% worth for money but charging take bit long time even fast charging but the time is reasonable since it has 6000mAh üîã. Battery Life is more than enough for non gamers 2-3hrs of charging (from 10-100%) last for 17-18hrs(regular usage like always connected to net,with whole day hotspot on ect... But not playing high graphics game like PUBG,free üî•.) But it runs free fire in ultra graphics with no lag. But not PUBG. Produced negligible heat while playing free fire in Ulta graphics.

"
"

  Worst quality just slipped in seating position lost display on the second day only I am unble to fined display now in online and offline all the money gone in waste. Low quality from brand like Samsung was disappointing. What should I do know leaving all 15499/- for  one day use I need to buy an other phone???

"
"

  Posting review after using the phone after 15+ days now. If you love mobile camera, then this is the phone in budget but if you are looking at performance then it is average. Sound output quality is very bad. Also having fingerprint sensor at the backside of the phone isn't a good idea. Rarely able to use it. Display is better.

"
"

  Good product in affordable price. It will interest those who are not expecting sensational qualities in such price. In a short note, you may go for it... But delivery by Amazon was time consuming considering my dire need for the phone

"
"

  I bought the mobile on 7th aug. The charging was good initially for 10 days, suddenly it stopped charging. At first I thought there was an issue with the charger, but when I connected it to a different the charging symbol was shown but battery was not geting charged. And it's been 2 day the phone is connected to a different charger. And no change. It is not charging.Not sure what the issue. But I did not expect such poor charging from such a reputed and brand new piece.

"
"

  Good things-1. Super bright amoled display and very eyecatchy colour2.long lasting battery life up to 2 days3. Audio output is very rich4. Weight distribution is very good5. It has 48 mp primary lens that capture very sharp photos6. And the main things of this camera, the algorithm is very appropriate7. It supports widevine L1, so you can enjoy full HD content in prime videoCons-No smartphone is perfect,  in this the cons is its plastic body and only the 15w charger.

"

  The look of the phone is very good. The best part of the phone is its battery backup. On a single charge one can use it upto more than 24 hours with constant use. Excellent camera quality.However, as compared to the 1st day, after 5 days of using the phone, the fingerprint reader at times don't read on the very first go. It require one more attempt. But still, for me it's okay.It's to my understanding, the best budget phone at this price with excellent features and exceptional battery backup.

"
"

  It's really a nice budget phone which is ready to chase day to day even and odds of digital era.. moreover it's battery life is really a beast üí™..Nice camera configuration with super amoled display... processing speed is really good..I assure u all.. kindly go for it.. finger print reader is very smooth..it's a right choice...

"
"

  The product is totally value for the money given. The low price and good features is what a customer wants and Samsung provides this. M21 turned out to be better than the handsets I've used before. It doesnt face heating issue either. The camera quality is as it is promised. Microphones records clearly and also the sensors all work perfect. Wide screen gives a cinematic experience for movies and the touch of dolby audio just makes you feel that you brought home a mini theatre.

"
"

  Truly. Perfect phoneVery soft workingVery clear cameraVery fast processorBest choiceThis phone is amazingThis phone is best price valued phoneSamsung Galaxy M21 is just perfectly made for everythingIt also hold long battery lifeI liked the this phone because this phone hold very good look this phone has very unique and different feature from all other phonesI just loved this phoneGood job Samsung hats off to you

"
"

  Phone unlock very fast using fingerprint sensor. 5000mah battery life runs more than 1 and half days. 48mega pixels tripple camera setup capture photos very clearly and super amoled led display always looks great. Thanks to samsung.

"
"

  Everything this fine about this phone except for the camera. If anyone is willing to buy it for camera purpose,don't do the mistake like me. Go for higher cameras,save more money and buy a better phone but if your purpose of the phone is other can shooting and clicking, phone good. The camera quality sucks a big time. Also no true colour of the photographs or anything we see,the amoled screen is of no help

"
"

  If you are looking for a phone under 15000 price range, then don't think too much , I am giving you gurantee. You may go for this phone. You may read many negative reviews but don't worry, I am using this phone and I can say this is thousands time better tham xiaomi or real me phones, even everyone will say the build quality isn't too much good, but I think this is good enough, bcs the colour is not a big thing for a phone the main thing is the software & hardware, and this is awesome in this phone.....

"
"

  Basically this phone is really a monster as in imags it looks little bit thick but in hand feel of this phone is far better as compared to the images shown , and the only drawback of this phone is its charging speed it usually takes 2- 3 hours to charge fully which is very disappointing and the other drawback is the video quality of the steady camera is not good enough .Bit still i recommend this phone over many as it is in budget and offcourse with the faith of samsung

"
"

  Backside Looks is awesome. Super amoled screen.  Quick fingerprint sensor, battery last upto 24 hours with moderate use. Super slow motion is amazing but shoot time is very less. Thanks samsung for proving  better option than Chinese mobile. Samsung started world largest mobile manufacturering unit in india.

"
"

  As the tagline of the phone it is indeed a monster.What a batteryWhat a cameraWhat a phone.I have been using it for 15 days now. I am completely  satisfied with this phone in terms of battery and performance.The exnos 9611 processor  is also as good as a snapdragonIn all the 15 days there was not a single time when this device lagged.So overall its a good device and i am happy  to purchse it from amazon.

"
"

  This phone is super good and cool. I have used this for 7 days the battery life is too good camera also good.But when you hold it in your hand the feeling can not be express. Very good grip in hand and for the first time i bought something from samsung.Good at gaming if you play pubg then maybe you can face little issue .Overall it is brilliant product from samsung thankyou amazone for deliver this to meAnd amazone packing was excellent .Delivery did'nt take too much time.

"
"

  It is worst phone I ever had. In First 10 days its work properly but after that its touch had some issues when i called customer care they  dont had pick n drop services. Due to covid 19 i am unable to go samsung care.then After some time its touch itself started working but now its display has a big spot and its increasing day by day. I dont recommend this phone to any one to buy. Rs 14000 is total waste for this phone and i will never ever buy any samsung product from now.

"
"

  Built quality of phone is not as good as Nokia 7.2.... Camera is almost like a 13 MP, touch feel is not good..... First time in my life blue colour phone sucks.... Built quality could have been better...I would recommend you to consider nokia 7.2 rather than any M series.....

"
"

  fingerprint is very bad, it doesn't unlock phone. only 4 times out of 10 is work. bettry life is great. camera quality is good in daylife but bad in low light.

"
"

  While making video calls I'm using headphones. When I remove headphones no sound on the external speaker of my phone. If I plug again the headphones I can hear. Or I disconnect the call and make a call again I can hear the sound via the external speakers of the phone. Please help me find a solution. This occurred only when making calls not for media playback.

"
"

  Samsung M21 in this price range not satisfied.. samsung India can give better quality than this..compared to other brands look wise it is poor.. rest display..battery ..tuch senceor..face unlock are working fine ..  ui is good...ui update should be given regularly for old phones also..samsung India not do much cost cutting.. atleast u can give back cover and ear phones with the mobile.. battery life very good.. camera quality also nice..

"
"

  Amazon should ban such products I wasted My full money the display itself is dead ..look now u may say I dropped the phone But I attach the phone screen and Back side not even a single Scratch This Phone looks like some Renewed phone Which started acting Weird in 18 days it bought now the display is completely out Never cheat people with such dummy vendors and products !! I am proceeding further with legal notice For the dirty things you provide ...

"
"

  Samsung has definitely backed some very good devices on M series. And M21 is no exception. Display is just wow. In this price range this is the best display ever. talking about the UI,One UI is very optimized and user friendly. Camera is also good,very decent,sometime struggles in night. Performance is very good for day to day use not for high gaming. Overall for my use I will give 4.7 out of 5. If you don't need high gaming you can go for it without seeing any mobile. It's really worth the price.

"
"

  VERY GOOD HANDSET!Camera- Very good camera, has a lot of modes like Hyperlapse, Super Slow Motion, etc. Front camera is also awesome.Screen- Very nice screen, it's very vibrant, colours are very good.Performance- I am using the 6GB RAM 128GB Storage varient and games work beautifully. I play GARENA FREE FIRE on this mobile, no lag  no issues, best.Thanks Samsung and Amazon for this beautiful for this awesome Galaxy M21.üòÄüòÄ

"
"

  I bought samsung M21for my mother who is a teacher and now her school has shifted all the classes and other activities online. This phone has a great picture quality for screenshots, images and video calls. The battery life is as guaranteed. The phone has amazing aesthetics which bring about positivity through its colors and advanced functionalities. All necessary and updated features such as office 365, linkedin etc are pre installed which is a great comfort. Gaming quality is also as expected.

"
"

  Very nice product from Samsungsuper colour midnight bluevery impressive lookbut one disappointment that I have already bought Samsung Galaxy M30sit resembles the same design except the Samsung branding at the backthis is not a big disappointment but when I use it I feels that I am using my old phonethen 1 thing that the configuration is awesome.If u are looking mobile for under 15000I will recommend Samsung Galaxy M21

"
"

  Display and battery are the biggest USP of this phone. I have to say only one thing it's display is just awesome you will fall in love with it. Once you will use AMOLED display you will never go back to IPS LCD. 600 Mah is a real monster you will get more than 1 day backup after heavy usage. Camera is also decent. Although it's back side could have been better than this plactic but overall phone is awesome.

"
"

  The Samsung M21 is a good to go for phone under the range of 15k, decent camera and friendly UI are some of the key features of the phone.I bought it under exchnage offer, and the process was quite swift, and hassle free and dont worry if you don't have the accessories of your old phone.. they still accept the exchange, just make sure the old phone is properly working and doesn't have much scrathes or broken or cracked surfaces.

"
"

  I think if amazon brings in phones with proccessor like helio gt under 15k price then I don't think that we need redmi or real me. Not expected this much features from Samsung tons of features loaded.If u want to do anything apart from gaming and video editing then go for it without a second thought.In terms of gaming it's good u can play pubg at a decent fps but after a hour the game starts to stutter.But in the end best purchase!!!!!!

"
"

  JUST GO FOR IT , DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT ANYTHING. YOU CANT GET ANYTHING BETTER AT THIS PRICE.CAMERA QUALITY IS SUPERB, VERY FAST AND SMOOTH OPERATION.  BEST CHOICE YOU WILL EVER MAKE. IF YOU HAVE 3000-5000 LESS BUDGET FOR A SMARTPHONE JUST WAIT AND INCREASE YOUR BUDGET AND BUY THIS, YOU WONT REGRET IT.

"
"

  Dissatisfied with this mobile Samsung M21It can't catch network. It is the biggest issue.Mobile became hot after using one hour continuously.Don't buy.If u want to replace the item.. u will get the exact item and unable to get ur money back.What to do?

"
"

  Best smartphone in this range for media consumption. Decent cameras with plenty of camera features. Battery backup is up to 2 days. Performance could have been better. Good phone for multitasking as well. I hope Samsung will upgrade its 9611 processor in future.

"
"

  Phone runs so smooth.Camera:Only few shots help us know that it is 48mp camera. Selfie camera is good. They say super steady video (it's steady) but no clarity!!Battery:Not so fast charging.Phone get heats up very quicklySuper display.Voice recorder is good.Smart switch is very helpful. üëç.If camera was good it is complete phone..

"
"

  Own a samsung m30 from last year and i must say a upgrade in true self be it battery, camera, processor pubg runs at smooth and extreme, considering the price rs12600 no other  smartphone brand can match to that gorgeous Super Amoled screen. And plus its made in India Gurgram!

"
"

  The phone's scene broke as in went totally blank just by being dropped on the bed on the mattress even though it had a protective guard , and when i went for service they said that the screen is damaged and it is not available for repair and they will give me a samsung credit note of the phone price minus the screen price. The validity of which was only 19 days. The scene quality was good but is wasn't durable. My suggestion will be not to buy it.

"
"

  Suggested this phone to my uncle who uses this mostly for whatsapp, phone calls, casual photography and youtube and he is very happy with the product. No issues with call quality, display is crisp and clear and no lags or whatsoever. Would definitely recommend.

"
"

  Galaxy M21, this set is really amazing in terms of price. Battery life is more than 2 days for me. I'm not a frequent caller but I keep my mobile busy through Facebook, Whatsapp, News Channel and sometimes Online movies. Look wise, I like it very much. Both Cameras are just stunning, pics quality is admirable. For me, it's a 10/10.

"
"

  This is awesome mobile in this budget segment. Display is fabulous. No heating issue. Battery performamce is very good. Taking 3 hrs to get fully charged. Camera is doing a nice job. Picture quality is pretty good. Overall nice in this price range. Samsung product we can find serivice anywhere. So go for it.

"
"

  Galaxy m21 gets all the balls in right pocket. The massive display with Samsung's sAMOLED screen is top notch and gives competition to smartphones in a higher range. Cameras are brilliant and effective in taking studio like photos in low light conditions as well. Samsung's exynos 9611 is a hard-hitting performer and completes all day tasks fluently. Design is eye catching and sturdy with amazing color combination. Overall galaxy m21 is a bang for buck package for gen Z!

"
"

  Battery life is amazing. I use my phone till 7 pm from morning with Wifi and Bluetooth always on still the battery remains in 30s. No need for power bank. Fingerprint reader is also quick. Very good purchase in that budget category. But if buying this device also purchase a back cover as it it slippery from backside.

"
"

  This is priced around 15000 and its specifications are ok for this price. Plastic back. No back covers available within the pack and even in local mobile shops. Phone s performance is good. Super amoled display is really superb. Heating issues while charging. 100 % charge lasts for 36 hours for average use. Compact design . Premium feel of Samsung . Auto brightness adjustment is great. Face lock and fingerprint scanner do the magic. Best buy phone.

"
"

  The Samsung galaxy is an amazing company:‚Ä¢it has an amazing fingerprint reader, the moment I put my finger on it, it opens!!‚Ä¢the battery life is even epic! If I watch 3 movies straight it would never endüòÉ‚Ä¢don't get me started on the camera qualityü•∞it has an outstanding performance recently. The zoom is smooth, there are many types of ways you can take pictures or videos!!The wallpapers are so beautifulI really recommend Samsung Galaxy üòÄ

"

  I have been using this product for the last 2 weeks  and i have been playjng pubg and give a good result never got stuck and  the game runs smoothly .Currently  i have been using the guesture mode and its seems that the apps are getting a 2 /3 seconds to respond.(the only negative  i have noticed)No much heating issuesGud camera qualityGud battery  lifeGud processor but not the bestValue for moneyBuy it . Its beeter than any other phones in the rangeüíØ

"
"

  Very nice in this segment.  Mostly the superAmoled display...It is very important.  Before this I used LCD display mobiles. Because we mostly spend time on the display.  Punchy colour.  Go for it. Thanks to amazon for bringing superb mobiles and fast delivery.

"
"

  Good for moderate users. I  bought this phone Its a really great phone it has very big battery and It lasted 2 days for me and one more thing no need to carry power bank anymore.  It has in built Dolby Atmos Audio. This mid range phone is suitable for daily use on app like prime video, Netflix, you tube, hotstar etc. It is very good.It has a great camera and good for gaming. M21 is far better than those chinese phones which gives you better perfomance at the cost of bad user experience and quality.

"
"

  Firsly,camera quality is really good.clear and detailed capture.coming to battery,it lasts for a whole day usage.screen resolution and clarity are impressive.feels good in hand,has a light feel,weight distribution is good.dont take this mobile if ur meant for gaming as this processor doesnt support such speed of graphics,as it struggles with slight lags.Overall this product is really impressive in all aspects other than for gaming.Go for it if u are moderate user.

"
"

  Naturally people would like to buy a xiaomi at this price point. But having used both, i can safely say that M21 is the best buy.My favourite part about this phone is its clean software and premium experience..Although it lacks in the performance depatrment by a little bit, For me it is no big issueIts diplay is just outstanding, beat in its league. Trust me display is more important than anything elseIts battery is humunguous. For an average user it would safely last for 2 days

"
"

  Best features in this price range with samsung brand value. 2 day or more battery life for a moderate user. Finger print reader is good. Not a bulky phone. Easy one hand operation. Camera is good.  Altogether  a nice phone.16/08/2020After 2 month's use again I am adding some more lines. I am very much happy with the performance.  Battery superb.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is an extremely good phone in this budget. Camera quality is very good with bright and colourful photos. Enhancement to the photo quality through triple camera and a powerful front camera enhances user delight. Touchscreen is also very smooth and has high quality feel. Processing speed is fast and screens are easy to navigate, a typical Samsung advantage. Strongly recommended for anyone looking for a 6GB RAM phone in this price. Very satisfied!

"
"

  Good camera, Good Battery back up, excellent display. If you are thinking for buying M31, except camera (64 mp instead of 48 mp) there are no other difference in the features but more economic.

"
"

  Good entry level phone. Network antenna embedded could have been better and the face recognition is very slow.spkr is good display is fine ...battery is vfm.camera is not my focus so not much to say.it firs well in pocket.gamers stay away from this phone. Its ideal for youtube browsing and elders. User interface is in between friendly and complex. Leanthy use gave me little pain in eyes. Charging is very slow. Overall its vfm. Looks premium.

"
"

  This mobile is to be actual good product .....in my life Best battery life in that mobile, and decent camera in that mobile ..... But this mobile camera very Little feature and don't get night selfie in that mobile.... And vary poor experience in one ui...only few themes u can set in mobile and other themes are paid themes ,so good mobile not very good mobile,and i should review about fingerprint scanner that finger print is good but faceunlock was ridiculous because, very slow face unlock ..

"

  Awesome phoneCamera quality good, love the Hyperlapse feature.Wide ange camera+5Good battery lifeDolby Atmos+5Always on display+5Over all amazing phone..Go for itüî•‚úåÔ∏èüëçüëç

"

  DONT EVEN THINK TO BUY ANOTHER MOBILE INSTEAD. I HAVE BOUGHT THIS MOBILE BEFORE 1 MONTH. I NEVER FELT ANY REGRET OF BUYING THIS. THE BATTERY LIFE OF THIS MOBILE IS SUPERRRRRR GOOD. U WILL JUST CHARGE YOUR PHONE TO 2 HOURS AND THEN U CAN USE IT FOR ALMOST 2 DAYS, WHICH IS ENOUGH FOR A DAILY USER. THE ONLY DRAWBACK OF THIS PHONE IS ITS PROCESSOR. BUT TRUST ME U WILL NEVER FEEL BAD ABOUT ITS PROCESSOR. SO DONT THINK ABOUT ANY OTHER PHONE AND GO FURTHER TO BUY THIS PHONE.

"
"

  Best Non-Chineese Smartphone under 14k...Great DisplayGreat CamerasGreat Battery lifeVery Good Processor - can play all the heavy games but in medium settings.Don't go for Chineese phones, go for the M21.You will be happy with it.

"
"

  Audio is not working while watching videos on YouTube and Facebook and  the microphone is not working while taking calls, only the calls can be listened when the speaker is on  in this Samsung m21 smartphone  and I have bought this on 13 may 2020. kindly help me and take this seriously. As of now I have disliked this order.

"
"

  Did a lot of research among other Chinese options but now having used this for last few days, no doubt that this is the best mobile in this price range with awesome display, battery and build quality alongwith the reliability of ""Made in India""  Samsung brand. No one can beat the gorgeous display of Samsung.

"
"

  After a few weeks of usage, I experienced device stuck while scrolling and that was a serious issue with the Os. Maybe future update will resolve this issue. Over all battery backup is fair, camera quality good, display good and charging fair. If you want a super amoled phone in this price range just order here from Amazon, you won't regret.

Sound clarity so Good.

  I have moved from an iPhone to Android and I'm having a very good experience having this phone, worth for every pennyAbout my experience:1. The battery , it's too good it goes on  running for 2 day's2. Fast charging will do it's job faster3. Camera is good , you can try many things4. Provides a good and minimalist gaming5. I recommend to the  people who are into  social media and movies/series,etc spending  much time with phone can buy this .

"

  always prefer Samsung /  Iphone over chineese phones because reliability ,minimal harmful radiations/ Reliability .Another beast from Samsung with good competitive price . Have been using for last 2 weeks . Overall Good PhoneThough Battery Life is not as expected

"
"

  Battery is not upto the mark as per product specification. Also heating problem is there while charging. Camera is poor like Redmi phones, artificial images. My Mega 6.3's 8mgp giving quality images compared to this. Now days every mobile company is manufacturing this kind of chip products. Only Android 10 is the gift for you. Average product  don't buy.

"
"

  ¬†Disappointed with this device.the first one that I got stopped working after one day.touch screen was unresponsive.same page kept on refreshing.could not unlock the phone.got a replacement after 10 days.the recent device is better but sometimes the touch screen is unresponsive.camera quality is average.Battery life is good.i would not recommend this phone to anyone.

  Hi everyone, I am using this phone from last two months. Its camera quality is very very excellent with AI support. Its sound is very pleasing and a favourite one.  I like the handset very much.During this pandemic period my son is taking his online classes hassle free.  Its internet accessing is very user friendly.I prefer  My M21 to everyone who loves speed and quality both.  Thank you Samsung.

"
"

  The phone is very well designed and has all the features that any phone doesn't have in this budget...But I would not like to suggest this for gaming because the performance is not soo well. Also the camera quality is wonderful and it's based ONE UI2. The battery life is not much as excepted. Overall the phone is low budgeted...but not satisfied with the thick phone.. actually it would have given a good quality battery for it..üëçüëç...THE MAIN THING IS THIS IS NOT AN CHINA PRODUCT

"
"

  Battery life is amazing, blue colour is best ,and camere i will say good , performance is very good as people say its not gaming phone but when i play pubg at HDR on ultra its smooth , i dont know why people say , game is working on very smooth 50 fps in hdr in my 4gb varientThanks for fast delivery üòä

"
"

  Battery life awesomeCamera quality back one is okay front one not up to the mark .The brightness is great as all other samsung mobiles .  The mobile don't have a cover in the box . The body type of mobile is plastic type hoped to see a glass one atleast.Processor gets heated up top much in normal to moderate daily usage also.No notification light . No noise cancellation is there.And the apps which have been baaned by the government were still present, not expected this samsung

"
"

  The phone is OK. Those who want a direct review here it is....The device build quality is supreme. You will feel pro while holding it. The device gets very heated (very very very heated) even if you launch the camera app for 1 minute. The gamimg experience is good but not awesome. Multi tasking in it is extremeeee. Awesome performance there no doubt. Issues with OS. But THE BEST BUDGET PHONE OF THE YEAR 2020.

"
"

  Totally disappointed after purchase the 48mp is just a number nothing else my 16mp vivo z1pro camera captures way Batter imagesAnd front camera is also below average in low light it's horrible wide angel is also not goodThe overall camera quality is not recommendableNo case providedLooks cheap plastic backMy fullhd+ display is way better than thisSpeaker is not good loud but bad qualityThe only good thing is its slow motion and super slow motion and battery

"
"

  I purchased this phone for my father as his birthday gift. So disappointed with the sound quality. You can barely hear the other person over a call. It‚Äôs such a faint voice coming from the other side. My purpose to buy this phone was to gift him something which helps him with better sound quality on videos and calls. Though the ring volume is good, even the video sound is ok but calls have real bad sound quality. Wonder if it‚Äôs a problem with this particular set or this model of Samsung.

"
"

  If switch on flash in dark and take a pic all i get is a black image,The phone has charging issues it stopped fast charging after one monthWhen connected to my laptop it says unable to recognise the device is malfunctionedAnd the customer service is always pathetic all they say is factory reset the device or visit serivce center.I have seen in samsung members forum many m21 users are reporting the same problem.Samsung should fix it

"
"

  The Dual VoLTE network is not stable in the device.The camera is good but not best as comparing with lens and MP.But a good choice considering the earlier price, however, Samsung has suddenly increased the price which is very annoying.

"
"

  Phone is very good according to price category.  We bought  as replacement to IPHONE 6. Performance is Good, Video quality is Sharp. Only negative is Sound Quality. Internet access is v good.

"
"

  1. Look wise its awesome2. Camera quality  is so much better than other phones3. Battery haven't proved  upto the mark4. Back cover must needed5. Best features but the call receiver quality  is not good with my product which i got but  it might differ with piece6. Delivery was best ...safe and secure though in covid pandemic.

"
"

  It is a wonderful Phone under 13k. Performence of this phone is awesome. I play PUBG for 1:30-2h per day , and it runs without lagging , but after 2 hour of gameplay I feel heating issue, but performance did not decrease. Camera performance is awesome. Battery backep is mindblowing. In one word , a perfect phone under 13k.

"
"

  After a month of use writing reviewBattery- 5000mah but like 4000mahCamera-48mp but not clear picture than samsung j7Touch- smooth and fastData speed- No data speed detection (nedd to onstall app for that)Display and other features are goodBetter to go for redmi note 9 pro in this price

"
"

  The phone looks good  it works also  but there is a diagonal inside big crack on the screen  .Tried to call the samsung customer care  Not very helpful  ,they are of the view that since it doesn't affect the working of the phone there is no problem  who would like to use a new phone with cracked screen  Amazone should also help their customers from getting victimised

"
"

  This Phone is The Ultimate Budget Phone.I Have Purchased Samsung M21 And M31 and these Phones are Just Awesome.Their Built Quality is GreatCome with A Massive BatteryAmoled Display4GB Ram which is Quite OK For GamingLovely Cameras.. Quad Camera setup...Best in Class Features With A Made in India Tag Line. Better Than Other Phones From Chinese Brands Like Xiaomi vivo oppo redmi etc.Love To Samsung And Amazon...

"
"

  Good mobile and battery performance is better Camera quality is also good but noSilicone case in the box and there are no üëÇ phone with mobile GOOD MOBILE. Not too good for gaming. Start heating very quickly.Battery life is good and also the rear camera but not the front. Overall a decent smartphone. I recommend to go for poco m2 pro whose higher variant has lower price than this and comes with fast charger and also with snapdragon chipset.

"
"

  PROS:1. Great Display2. Best Battery Life3. Good Cameras4. Great One UI5. Great Sound Quality through Speaker and audio Jack6. Frequent Updates7.Triple SlotCONS:1. Average Performance2. Slow Charging Speed3. Average Fingerprint reader Speed compared to the competitionThat's all according to me . Maybe I have missed some points . I am reviewing this phone after using it for around 2 months .Thanks For Reading.

"
"

  On the bright side camara quality and battery backup is very good. If u have already used any china phone u might find difficult to use it because some basic options like AppLock and phone cleaning features. keeping aside u can install some alternate apks from playstore. And also u need to bye backpouch and temperglass (if necessary) seperately as it won't come along with package. It is taking nearly 2hr for full charge as it is only 15volt charger available.

"
"

  This is my first Samsung device . My biggest concern before purchasing this phone was about the battery.*Good Battery Life*Pretty quick charging speed*No doubt camera is also good as compare to Redmi 9 pro*Display quality is superbOverall it is good phone in the price segment of 15K.

"
"

  Phone is advanced but quality of this product is worsed.After 2 months of use led liqid comeout and screen damaged and when we went to samsung service centre they quoted 5500 rupees for replacement of led pannel so we can't afford that amount after 2 moths of buying.Now we think go to consumer forum for settlement.

"
"

  Mobile is not good compare to other brands with similar specs/cost.Camera: 4/10Battery: 6/10Charging: 4/10 (with original fast charger it takes around 4hrs to charge fully (5% - 100%)Issue while sending message: I am not able to send messages  by putting  sim in slot1.It is costlier considering all the above points.

"
"

  I have seen almost all videos on YouTube about this monster phone and believe me it's best phone under 15k.Camera- ultra wide angle is amazing it captures real beauty.Front camera is also good but when we zoom in quality is not that good.Night mode is also average quantity.Battery- almost one and a half day long lasting on heavy usage.

"
"

  Camera is awsome....as always..all mobile have issue with zoom focus....battery life is mark up to 1.5 days for normal use..without gaming....build quality is good..dark mode work fine....6000mha battery is too good to buy...photo click in running car..

"
"

  Overall the phone is value for money, the response time in fingerprint reader is a bit slow, and the phone ask you for pattern at times and do not accept finger print.Camera quality is really good for the price segment.Battery life is about 1.5 day on normal usage. 1 full day on heavy usage.Processor is a little slow but you should know how much you are spending too.In nut shell great phone and value for your money.

"
"

  I bought it for for Rs12600. All things like Camara, speed, screen, android version and its update are up to the mark, after all this is samsung. Bought just 8 days ago so could give detailed review after some more days.One thing I don't like that samsung claim this is 6000 mha battery, but in reality its backup is any other samsung phone battery of 4000 or 4500 mha only. And the phone feel little bit heavyone

"
"

  As cost of mobile is 14k so at this price samsung is providing a value for money mobile in my opinion so don't delay just go for it it has decent look jabrdst bettery life and cemera is also good but one thing i feel like it would havebeen nice if samsung had provided a earphon cord but for this price this phon wins my heart

"
"

  Finger print  reader was erratic in the first delivery and Finger print reader as well as Memory card reader was defective which spoilt my 32GB Samsung SD card which was not detected in the replacement Cellphone. Then I brought another 32GB Samsung SD card which was also spoilt. I decided to buy the same product  in SAMSUNG dealer in Chennai which is cent percent okay. I lost 2 weeks time without phone and 2 SD card.

"
"

  In INDIA, most of the peoples belongs from a millennium community & background. They seek for a budget Smartphone having a powerful  processor, long battery life, better quality camera & a great display experience.their finding criteria matches with Samsung M21 #theMegaMonsterOn other hand Samsung's brand reliability is just awesomely satisfactory.I'm using this phone & I'm loving it, an amazing experience I have got. I have got what they had exactly promised to give.

"
"

  Reviewing after 2 days of use.Fingerprint reader, battery, camera quality is decent for this price.Screen display quality is really good.Speaker is average.Overall, it's ideal for non-gamers.

"
"

  Nothing to say ... Samsung m21 just awesome i loved it ..what a monster awesome camera , super battery long lasting. The superamoled display is just lit awesome display ... overall in the price range m21 is the best smartphone i used what a quality product ...i jave only a small minute problem that is compairing to redmi the signal catching capacity is bit less .. otherwise its the best smartphone available in the price range .....loved it

"
"

  Trust my word or leave it, you choice!!!1. Latency issue while scrolling through apps/list of items2. Call connection duration lags3. Picking up network signals, but internet speed completely poor compared to realme/Redmi on same location on same sim card4. Sometimes you don't even can make a call on single bar on network, where realme/Redmi canTake it or leave it, choice is yours

"
"

  Never expected this from you amazon..This is what you have sent on behalf of the order placed. After extendings weeks and weeks in the name of investigation you came up neither replacing the product nor refunding the amount.Never Gonna place an order in near future and recommending the same to knowns as well.

"
"

  Battery life is excellent and its hold charge for 1 dayCamera quality is good .Fingerprint reader is working very  slowly need to improve a lot.Processor is little bit slower.If I used wet hands on display the phone stars freezing.Design is better but not much attractive than other brand mobiles at this  price range.If back cover had a glass then it would much attractive.Display quality is excellent .

"
"

  Samsung phones are superb and the m21 is no exception..The caemra though could have been better and hope they release a pure android version in the future.. the bloatware is simply too much..

"
"

  I have been using this phone for more than a month now. I found it a very practical and value for money device for my daily use. Fingerprint readers works fine but slightly slow at times, battery life excellent, camera quality is good. It is not a gaming phone and I found some lag if I try to do multitasking. Over all in my opinion it is value for money smartphone from a brand ""Samsung ""...Thanks

"
"

  I order it on 29 may and got it for 12,699.Great value for money yeah and ya better go with a good cover as it has plastic bach and might get scratch easily. Build quality is decent. One thing I noticed that the area holding fingerprint with back body is not quite fixed its poping out every time i use fingerprint but that's minor unnoticable.And it takes me arout 90mins to charge it completely from 0 to 100.

"
"

  First of all, let me address the elephant in the room, I did not buy this only because it's non-Chinese. I have seen a number of reviews and realized it was as par and in some aspect better than similarly priced phones (Realme6, Redmi Note 9/pro etc). Also, it offers a much cleaner, bloatware-free UI experience albeit not stock. Using for last one week and I think I made the right choice.

"
"

  The phone is just amazing!!If you are not a gamer and like to binge watch then go for it. No better option at this price point1.The display is flagship level.colours are punchy and blacks are just elegant.2. Battery life blew my mind. I watched a 2 hour movie and battery dropped just 6%.3.camera is also top notch. There is enough detailing and post processing is also good.I was confused between realme 6 and m21 and i am happy i went with m21. Worth every penny.üòçüòç

"
"

  After 20 Days Usage,, IT is a killer phone in this Price segment instead of Gaming Experience and i except a little bit good processor and color But If u Choose Better Screen Better Battery life Better Camera,Comfort,Charging Quite Good and the thing which made it beast is Samoled Display Than go for it

"
"

  Battery and camera is awesome if i talk about fingerprint sensor it is quickly unlocked your phone Samsung is doing excellent work  super amoled display  and huge battery and super steady camera is best in this price

"
"

  The m21 is amazing quality for its price. Great processing and durable build doesn't make you feel like you're using a cheap phone(which unfortunately it does in this price range). I get a premium feel using this phone. The Ram and storage are perfect for this phone. Camera quality is very high and you don't really need the 4th cam available on m21. The best thing about this phone is the amoled display. It alone makes it feel like I'm using a flagship phone. A guaranteed bang for buck!

"
"

  Plz don't buy the product of Stpl exclusive which are fulfilled by Amazon.I'm buy samsung m21 it's very bad product .i can replacement the product.replacmnt product is also bad which is packed phone and switch on the product is looked.Display timing 2-5 sec on light than auto lock.It is not changed by the settings plz don't buy

"
"

  The display got blurred in few days and completely turned off next day. Raised return request and initially it went as return only since the seller doesn't have stock to replace. There was hurdle in return pickup and it took nearly 10 days to get the replacement. Had to make multiple calls and chats with over 7 agents to explain the issue and get the return issue sorted out.The replacement is good so far. Will keep posted.

"
"

  ¬†This phone we ordered on Aug-17th and not shipped until Aug28 and we received by. Aug 29th.We tried to start the phone after we received it, and noticed that. touch not working. Thanks to Amazon, We ordered return for the same. Not sure if it's a new phone or re-furbished piece. Amazon allows to return with in a week ,  if we would've delayed phone setup by trusting. this vendor, our money would've been in water.

"
"

  Everything in the phone is good. Best feature are1. Super moled(Samoled) display2.6000 mah powerful battery3. Best camera4.value of moneySome disadvantageous  are1. 15w fast charging take 3hr for full charging2. Back of screen is susceptible  tp stretch so it need protective casing..

"
"

  Slight bulky. A slimmer model would be nice. Within 3 months display panel went out of order and got it replaced at Samsung Care for free of cost. Again after about one month, the display panel went out of order. Some serious problem with the display panel.

"
"

  Great phone in this budget.....sold my honor pro tk get rid of Chinese and bought this. Amazing phone in the budget with the tag of samsung

"
"

  I m using this phone since more than one month .Camera is good in every mood , but little bit haze in zoom covering. Excellent battery life .fingerprint awesome but when ur finger get watery it doesn‚Äôt get in single touch . PUBG is easy going even though in full setting no lagging , ram management is better than many smartphones of this prices . Sounds is good with one speaker ‚Äú louder and clean‚Äù . And one big bugs in auto brightness I hope in newer update Samsung will fix this bugs .

"
"

  Overall the phone is reallygood. The best feature is the battery. With heavy internet usage and video streaming the phone ran for 2 entire days. The camera is also quite. The finger print scanner is lacking. Does not work flawlessly. Have to tap 2 3 times in may occasions. In 14k range it is value for money. My display had been replaced as it was not working properly but since was in warranty period I got the replacement free. Now the phone is doing great.

"
"

  Everything is like as i expected but processor is not so good...phones functionality is average and also its weight is too much if you watch video for long hrs while phone is in your hand your hands are started getting tired soon so make you bought a cover with stand while you order this phone otherwise amoled display, camera and battery back up is excellent in this range of price bought at ‚Çπ11700.Request to Samsung please use snapdragon processor

"
"

  It's a amazing products, I can't believe this performance of camera and Finishing design for m21, I think it's a one of the best mobile in this price, battery life is good and fingerprint reader awesome thanks for Amazon delivering safely...I just purchased Resmi note 9 pro last month but it's not best between Samsung m21 I really appreciate Samsung m21 mobile for design and Touch experience. Thank you so much

"
"

  By using this for 10 days I am giving this review awesome display, fingerprint reader ,camera is also very good very nice battery backup all things are awesome in this phone  but in my opinion this is not a gaming phone but  there is no issue while playing games I am saying this because it hasn't a strong processor thank Amazon for Awesome product

"
"

  M21 is the best smartphone by far in this price interm of processors  baterry life  camera n ram n it body set . if you still confusing jus browse google about m21 advantage  with other phone especially  processorüòçü§©ü§© .in this price  yull be suprised .ithink i have choose the right product with out wasting my money n also thanks to amazon in these time like this which human being suffer from this virus but you guys you risk your life n delivery in jus 3 days  salute  n respect‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ to amazon

"

  I have been using Samsung Galaxy M21 for over a week and here is my review.Pros:sAMOLED display (a feature that made me choose samsung M21 over all others)Good battery lifeTriple main camera, making it good for photographyConsGets heated while chargingVerdict:Overall, it has been a great investment. It has the latest Android and Exynos 9611 processor which guarantees a smooth experience.

"
"

  I bought this smartphone from 25 days ago. Its camera quality is just awesome both rear and front but selfie performance in low light is poor. Battery backup is good for normal usage. Display quality and other features are also good.But it has lower heating issue. I am very disappointed with the processor of Samsung, problem with network connection.Overall if you are a normal user, not a heavy gamer and your budget is below 15k you may buy it.

"
"

  Purchase this phone on 12th of May. Was highly satisfied with the performance, but after 3 month it suddenly stopped responding to charger. Went to samsung service center, they said there is nothing wrong with the charger. Now the phone is in service center and they said it will take min 14days. Samsung produce more than 10k phones per day and it takes them 14days to repair one. Thumps down. Everytime I convince myself to go for samsung, it ends up by disappointing me.

"
"

  I've been using this mobile from last 2 months and now pink color dots appeared on screen n increasing these dot sizes& total screen invisible now. I've experienced same for M31 which i had to buy for my family, In M31 also same issue, Samsung showroom asked 5k for screen change&it doesn't qualify for warranty. I paid 5k for M31. I strongly suggest all users that if u r ready to pay 5k more on coming months after purchase then you may go ahead for purchase of M21 or M31.

"
"

  I had a very bad experience with this phone. Within 15 days off buying this phone. The screen started flickering. By than the Amazon return window was closed. We got it repaired from the service center during the pandemic :(It again stopped working in a month of the repair. All the money wasted. Not sure if it this phone specific or is it samsung phones in general.

"
"

  Using it for a few days. Baught 6GB 128 GB version. Very impressive phone in this medium budget. Delivery as committed by Amazon guys.Excellent speed in Apps for 2.3GHz Exynos 9611-Octa Core processor. Launched in March 2020, so latest Technological Specs are available.Thanks South Korea for making it in India. Strongly recommended. Really good battery backup. Only sad part , Samsung is increasing its price.

"
"

  Your phone is best in using battery life while I use my regular applications like uber, ola, starmaker,etc. There is no heating issue in this phone no hanging issues nothing. Just one complaint is on package I didn't get samsung earphones. Your earphones are best but in packing of this phone I didn't get it right now im8using boat earphones else I have no complain for this phone that's it sir thank you for this beautiful and smooth phone and I loved all features of this phone.

"
"

  I have a big desire to buy One plus, but then i realize that we need to boycott all Chinese product, That's why i buy SAMSUNG M21 and believe me the Battery life and processes and the look are really cool, I bought this in mid June so i just faced lack of back cover and tempered glass, because of newly release product.

"
"

  Overall not good,Camera is awesome,Network quality is poor as compared to other handsets,Battery drains so quickly and charging takes a lot of time,Flash charging not up to the mark

"
"

  Good looking. Good camera. Overall a branded mobile. But sometimes there is disturbance /Problem in network. I found the Signal reception power is low in comparison with other mobiles in somewhere. It also I believe that the network problem may be rectified by updating the software as it is Samsung. Overall Samsung is Samsung. üëç

"
"

  Amazon customer service is amazing....Excellent phone .Getting problem with new mobile but my mobile is replaced within 2 days after complaint registered.If you buy from Amazon you don't need to worry aboutFinally last advice don't buy M21 . Third grade build qualityThanks Amazon

"
"

  Personally I like this mobile for the battery life,picture quality,screen size,sharpness of picture quality,features and every thing 100% satisfactory and the value is more than the money( I spent the money for it ) buying this Samsung M21  mobile,Thank you Samsung and Amazon for best prices and best quality products,last time I bought one  Samsung M30,based on  its features,working,I decided to buy one more mobile of Samsung.So,I bought this SamsungM21.

"
"

  Camera: 4/5 good front and backBattery : 5/5Performance : 4/5 very good for normal use and slight gaming heavy gaming is some laggyBuild quality : 3/5 no problem u can use case for it to protect and tempered glassDisplay : excellent 5/5Charging : 15 w goodUi : good , screen recording option is not there, implement it , dual apps not working properly especially second whatsapp won't support stickers etc... Has to fix this

"
"

  Excellent enhanced performance with same reliability. I m a Samsung user since 2004, its flip model with polyphonic tunes, a great product always. And these phones are like Honda brands, they will give us great resale value, ofcourse u got tired of using but it will continue to deliver and one fine day, to buy a new Samsung u can sell the old one to the needy.

"
"

  The product is great the only issue is here is that the performance  is slightly  low in this price point compared  to other phone like mi note 9 pro which cost exact same price other than that every thing is ok üòÉEdit:- After using this device let me share some of the weak point you can't  consider  this device for gaming because it heats up after few minutes  of gaming  and also after heating  u will see lots of fps drops üòê

"
"

  I'm giving  1 star because  of poor battery  backup. Maybe  my Mobile have  this issue. I asked for replacement Amazon but very bad response.  Very bad experience in Amazon  first time. I'm not fool to ask replacement  unless  there is an issue.  The customer  care is not at all listening. Flip kart is far better than Amazon.

"
"

  Suboptimal performance. Issues with cellular network reception. Average camera, battery back up is good and UI software is flowless. Samsung has advantages for been ""made in india"".Phone has good specification in paper, but average in reality, considering the price range is fine, but competition phones seem to perform better. But then all of those are Chinese crap.. which can't be trusted. Well you don't really have a choice.

"
"

  Fingerprint is quite well it has good response  time.  As it has large battery  of 6000 mah battery and on normal use one can use it for 2 days. It has large battery  but Samsung  has amazingly managed the weight . This phone is very much lighter than realme x2 with 4000mab battery  and Galaxy  m20 with 5000mah battery.  Amazing  smooth  phone for daily users.  I am not a gamer so i haven't played  anh games on it but this phone is amazing  for daily uses.

"
"

  Dislike and not suggested to anyone to go for this one b'cos i have purchased Samsung Galaxy M21(6GB,128GB) on 08.06.2020. First issue charging problem in July 2020 and rush to service center it has been ready with service charge-Rs.1150/- . in September 2020 the display has gone out and the service center advised it will chargeable with cost of Rs.5900/-. one can purchased this mobile Rs.15999/- and within 3 months it attracts another Rs.7500/- appox.

"
"

  One of the best phone at this range this year, and it very well Does the job for daily work. Louder voice assistant feature Which similar to and talk back. ek specially suitable for visually impaired like me

"
"

  Writing this review after using 3 days, two full charges...Pros :1. Battery life is awesome2. Touch and fingerprint readers are very smooth3. Rear & front camera in day light is okay. Samsung can do better.4. Weight & size is comforting in palm5. Processor is also good and smooth, no lagging so farCons:1. SIM tray is cheap, it's not so smooth . Got stuck multiple times with 2 sims before I could insert it properly

"
"

  Well, totally money worth product.Battery backup is really good you don't need to charge second time in one day if you charge fully in morning.Screen Quality is vary good and it is smooth.Camera quality is also good but sometimes it takes time to load the camera.Memory is also good and suffient in this range.The fingerprint reader is also fast as expected.And this product is worth the money as for given the specs.It runs good and smooth.

"
"

  good for daily usage.. performs very well.* camera is too good* display, call quality is too good.* One ui 2.0 is great... very bettery smooth..* For music lovers, musics and sound quality is bit laud but its not much clear like nokia and moto devices. this device having dolby atmos tool but it will not help to generate excellent sound.* its not for gaming.. asphalt 9 playable on high qualty with some frame drops and lag.

"
"

  The phone itself is pretty amazing, great interface, great software, and it's still worth it of its price, the battery life is the show taker here, camera quality is good too, and I don't use fingerprint reader though, but you can count on it, the cons is the phone comes with samsung browser as it's default browser samsung browser is really buggy so that's frustrating, do change the default browser, and Samsung do improve your browser it's really bad.

  I'm satisfied with the phone but battery becomes too exhausted when using hotspot. Screen of the phone is not so strong. It is easily broken when fallen from a height of 2 feet

"
"

  I've been using this phone for three months now, the battery of the phone is quite good, if I charge it in the morning, I don't have to charge it all day long.The camera is quite good ,,But I will not prefer this phone for playing games,, I've play pubg in this phone and my experience is not that much great. The screen of the phone is not very easily screwed but the back cover should be attached as soon as you buy the phone. overall like the phone.üòä

"
"

  I won't recommend buying this phone .. it takes more than 2 hours to charge .. this is a serious drawback .. I had mi phone earlier and it used to get charged in less than half time taken by this one

"
"

  Notices Phone getting heat quickly while takingRest all value for Money

"
"

  In this Dolby mono speaker sound quality is awesome. Battery backup excellent, RAM & ROM is good. No hanging issues. Camera quality superb who loves  camera they can buy with out doubts. Few people said samsung phones are hanging but there are no hanging issues in it. Process speed is good. There are no network issues working perfectly. Finger print feature simply superb. Display quality excellent excellent. I love this mobile.

"
"

  SAMSUNG is always good but this time i found little bit problem with camera if you shaking your hand so you ll get blurry picture even little bit of hand shake its getting blurry otherwise good for battery screen and size in this price nice

"
"

  Pro: Affordable smartphone that brings a lot of features under its roof. Among all, the battery is extremely good that can offer more than one day of usage. It also has ample storage, an immersive display, a nice set of camera and a good processing unit.Con: Though it has massive battery life but charging time is little longer as it comes with 15W charger.

"
"

  This smartphone is really good with a huge battery that gives a very good backup along with the camera quality which is, well, it's better at this price range. I love Samsung's AMOLED displays, which brings the colors to life. Everything's good about the phone except the build quality. The phone is completely made out of plastic and it doesn't give the feel of a Samsung phone. That is the only thing I dislike about it, otherwise, it's a great phone!

"
"

  Excellent Mobile....Pros1. Stunning Display.. Display is awesome and stunning..2. Battery Life - very good battery life3. UI - One UI 2.0 is really cool and slick.4. Camera - Great Camera

"
"

  Value for money........facing some issues after usage...The auto dimming is not working in some conditions....Facing issues in network..don't know it is problem with network operator or phone....the thing is....i can easily stream YouTube videos...but at the same time may other apps including flikart..Amazon dont load....its keep on buffering too much to load the pages...

"
"

  its been a week n the phone(half top) is heating so much that i can't touch while charging or while internet is on. What's the reason ? I can't figure out.after a month reviewNow my phone is in good condition and not heating so much which I have faced before.loving it.

"
"

  Nice phone from Samsung. Good display, smooth touch, finger unlock, screen view. No hang, no heating problemBut battery of 6000 mah do seems to be what it should be. Charging is bit slow.Overall liked the phone.

"
"

  Samsung has lived  to my expectations,The super Amoled display with which we interact with the most is best in the price range.6000 MAh battery easily keeps up your phone for 1.5 days on heavy usage.Camera has improved a lot. And UI is smooth as butter. Need to mention that there are no excess bloatware (some samsung apps are pre installed) and unnecessary notifications.

"
"

  Such a good looking phone. It looks way more expensive than it really is. Feels really good in the hand. Great camera. And the blue color is just mesmerizing. Great buy. Go for it with your eyes closed. Loved it!

"
"

  Battery back up and storage is very good. In past, I was using Samsung Galaxy on 8. If I compare with that it is far better. In that phone volume of the phone was quite low because the speaker was on the back. But this time it is at the side so volume is loud and clear. Auto brightness works very well now. But what I miss is secure folder is not in it. That I used a lot.

"
"

  Decent phone  but its for basic phone user not meant for heavy usage nor for gaming. Battery is 6000 MAH but works as equal to 4000 to 4500 MAH. Sometime phone lags in between multiple APPS.Go for 6 GB RAM instead of 4 GB RAM

"
"

  Very nice product from samsung it has long lasring battery on normal usage it lasts about 2 days and game booster enables to play games like pubg anf freefire smoothly nice rear camera and front camera it has option lke slow motion superslowmotion paranoma effect anyway very hsply with the product!!!!!!!!!!!

"
"

  Nice phone with all specifications upto the mark.battery takes a bit long time to get fully charged.but once charged runs for the day.camera is also good.not much pre installed apps unlike Xiomi.back cover could have been of metal ,the plastic make doesnt give a premium look.Got after exchange for 11299.worth a shot.

"
"

  Received defective piece, front camera was not working, arranged replacement of defective piece but amazon delivery executive cancelled the the return order saying fornt camera is now working. He didn't listened to me, I explained to him that it is replacement of defective piece not an exchange but he didn't understand and cancelled the order. I have wasted my two weeks because your delivery executive is failed to understand difference between exchange and replacement

"
"

  First of allSuper Amoled is best in this smartphone.Battery life also good.Ram management is good.Loud speaker is slightly less compare with chinese mobiles.Fingerprint also works well.Corning gorilla glass 3 protection in it.it protects from major drops.Exynos 9611 processor works well in ram management.Dolby atmos support.it takes into the heaven.There is no ADVERTISEMENT.Slow motion and super slow motion in it.

"
"

  Solid performance... battery lasts for two whole days ...camera is very good...shot some sunrise pics with that....see the pics for samples....phone is with back cover ..I bought Raven black color....

"
"

  Hi,I have research many phones and select m21, now I m feel I have taken right choice, for this price range, sampled display is awesome, sound is good, camera excellent battery 2 days with normal usage, samsung is good option Samsung Redmi, fantastic,  go ahead without any doubt

"
"

  I will strongly recommend not to purchase this phone. I purchased this and then after receiving I again purchased Redmi 8 pro. This phn has inbuilt sound Processing problem. Garbel sound appers on other end. Zero rating

"
"

  After 25 days of use i can say performance is good for a budget phone. Display is the key advantage. Battery perform well for almost 36 hours with normal use.Camera and video quality is moderate with so many shooting mode options.With a branding or samsung you are getting more then enough.Most of all it is a non Chinese phone which serve its cause.Jai hind.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader: Excellent and very useful soft touch and more sensitive... Ok I'm using with fingerprint touch to go front panel....Battery life: Best Quality of Battery life, Almost one full day for continuous usage of internet and calling,Fast charging also very quickly...Canera: This is is best camera Quality ,I never faced any other phone like this... Lot of a option in camera... Live photo, Slowmotion video...You don't need to buy separate camera...

"
"

  Fingerprint reader and battery life is good. Takes 5 to 6 hrs to charge. Camera is worst. Takes 1 to 2 mins for the internet to start when internet is turned on. Handset speaker and loudspeaker is not loud. Also no headset provided by Samsung. In short I am not a happy owner of this Samsung handset I rate 0 to Samsung in terms of the above.

"
"

  It's pricey, obviously paying for the brand value. Fingerprint reader is slow. Processor is good for my dad but for users like me who multitask, u will notice the lag. Phone feels good in hand, solid.

"
"

  One of the best phone ever. It has an extra ordinary fingerprint reader which does no mistakes. The battery life is very excellent, enabling you to see internet for about 22hrs with 100‚ÑÖ charge.the camera quality is finest of all, Giving you a 48mp clear and bright image.the camera also has 3d view to take a shot of large area. Auspicious phone at this rate.very good and smooth for gaming and studies. Buy it by closing your eyes

"
"

  Loved it. The touch is so smooth. It's been 3 months since I bought this and there's no fluctuation in its speed. A vivid display and great brightness as the screen is of the fullest size. Battery is great and works nicely for outdoors. Have been buying Samsung phones since years and would always prefer buying them. Till now its charging fast. Camera quality is amazing of the rear as well as the front camera. Altogether, a great buy in a budget.

"
"

  Everything is just great in this phone...I think this series not supports knoxfingerprint is faster... dont expect a flagship experience, you are not buying a chinese phone with low quality faster fingerprint sensors.  battery is very good ... im using 40% to 80% cycle to charge the phone.  sometime heat comes from upper side of the screen .. but that is not a problem maker... the july update reduced some heating.i dont have any issue to unlike this phone

"
"

  First I would like to say that it is not for gamers it is four mid users and normal users .CAMERA 4.5 / 5Back camera is good but front is not up to the mark .PERFORMANCE  4.5 / 5This has  exynos 9611 processor which is for normal use .BATTERY 5 / 5Best under this price . Worth more than 5 . EVERYTHING IS OK IF YOU NEED A  MID PERFORMANCE PHONE AND HIGHER BATTERY PHONE AND A BRANDED PHONE .

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor not properly attached. Have to take the order already has been replaced. Already taken around 15 days time. If my old mobile been working properly, Must not have taken.

"
"

  Fingerprint is ecxelent and also battery life but charging time is high lumpsump 3 Hours.Rear camera quality is good but front camera is not 8 mega pixel an average 2 mega pixel. And Samsung Earphone is apsent.But overal product is good.Samsung is my first choice.

"
"

  I am very happy to review the samsung mobile M21.When i bought  this mobile I am not sure about  the performance. Frankly speaking after i have used one week, this phone is perfect for me becoz I alwaystense for battery back, this phone is superb for battery as well as camera is also awesome.Finally I can say my search is complete  on Samsung M21..

"
"

  Facing issues w.r.t. calling, voice breaks and signal fluctuates whereas in much inferior sets with same Airtel connection, this is not an issue at all when we compare all other sets in front of us simultaneously. Will try to cross check on the same problem today as well and let's c what happens.

"
"

  Phone very slow.... Exynos processor is slowest working processor.Camera quality is poorGo for a redmi with snapdragon , no other processor is better.Body also uglyHa best screen only 1 good thing

"
"

  Really disappointed....Very bad mobile ....2 time order both devices returned bcs of same network issue.....All mobile have very good network on same sim same location but in this samsung mobile network never shows full.....Very weak signal in mobile....m.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not working. Even it doesn't detecting the fingerprint while touching it by recieved date .I purchased for the first time from Amazon ,and  after this not going to purchase in future. I tried to return the product but the customer care services are making fool ,such as you have to download an app to detect us your mobile device issue and the irony is ,that app not even run in this device ..Such making fool of poor people in India.

"
"

  The phone is brilliant the cameras are outstanding the and the 6000mah battery is superb and its performance is quite good also it supports Smooth+extreme setting in pubg and is very impressive because I think that there are only a few midrange mobiles that supports that setting in pubg it's cameras are amazing it has a variety of features that are not available in many devices So in my point of view Samsung M21 is the best value to money smartphone right now .

"
"

  This is not a good one to use youngster. Suitable only for people need more battery life. Complaints are detailed below.Processor: it is not much faster even though you use a best network and if you type a word the letters will come net day. Speaker: if you use the maximum sound to listen a song the speaker will make extra sound. And camera quality is poor.Only the worthiest thing is battery

"
"

  Pros: great battery life, very fast finger print reader, decent camera in this price, need not say about display-it's Samsung. Love this display. Overall phone speed is more than OK considering the price.Cons: box should contain back cover. No good perfect fitted cover available outside market even online. If anyone knows any good back cover for m21, pls provide the link. Thanks in advance.Low light camera performance is not good.

"
"

  The fingerprint reader was very nice.The battery life was excellent.And a decent camera quality.Overall the Samsung M21 mobile is an excellent  performer at an affordable price.

"
"

  The phone battery camera quality(both back and front) is awesome.  But the finger print sensor needs some improvement. Altogether if you are one of those #banchinese product person then this is the product which is for you.

"
"

  I am using samsung M30s since last 5 months.This product is just amazing. Samsung has sone a good job. People might think it's just similar to it's predecessor M30s, but no samsung has given some minor tweaks in this phone. With the latest one up 2.0 there are some apps which are updated, as it is shipped with android 10 In box it comes with the latest security patch.Apart from the front camera is 20MP which is awesome.

"
"

  Very good phone . Very good battery life .camera quality is awesome . Good sound quality  . Go for it . I am fully satisfied . But sometimes finger print sencor not work . It may be my finger problem . Buy it . I will give Five star .

"
"

  Why did I purchased this phone from Amazon the worst service I get from. And the phone was in very bad conditions. I will never buy anything from Amazon. Thank you for your worst service

"
"

  Neither I nor any other person to whom I call from this handset can heard voice unless I on its speaker, it happened after  ten days. I requested to Amazon to replace but they say that more than seven days have been passed, so we can't do anything. Thereafter, when I contacted to Samsang Service Center they replied that motherboard of this phone will be replaced and it will take 15 days. Now what I can do ? A defective handset sold by Amazon.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very fast & smooth... battery life is awesome it comes 2 days for me... nice camera beautiful pictures comes in this 48 & 20 mpixel camera... m21 is the best mobile samoled screen is so good... totally beautiful & good mobile

"
"

  Awesome mobile in every Corner. I suggest go for M21 best battery backup, best camera quality, Samsung is the best Mobile....Everything works very smooth and fine.Battery is humongous. One ui is super smooth. Camera's are fine. Display is gorgeous. Performance is good for day to day use.Instead of 15w charging they should have provided atleast 25w of charging.Best is that it is a non Chinese phone......It is my open challenge Samsung is not compare any Chinese mobile.

"
"

  AR emoji features is amazingFingerprint is quite slowCamera is averageNo sense of 48 MPImage processing is very goodUI stands out of allOverall amazing phone for samsung phoneAverage midgrange smartphone for critics

"
"

  The display is stunning, camera is good, exceptional battery life.... for people who consume lot of media this is great as it has AMOLED screen and dolby atmos support.... one UI is really smooth... if u are upgrading from an IPS LCD panel, u will really fall in love with the sAMOLED display...

"
"

  For the price,the phone is just a beastThe Display is magnificent as every Samsung phone with an amazing 2 day battery life with a decent charging speed.The camera is pretty good both front and back though the wide angle could have been better with no option to shoot video from itThere's not much to be angry about keeping the price in mind and it seems perfect with the amazing build quality as wellQuite an amazing finger print sensor as well

"
"

  The phone MIC was not functioning after 15 days of delivery. I contacted customer care samsung telephonically but they could not solve the problem . Today I reached the service center at lalbagh, Mumbai and they say they the display is faulty and need to be replaced and they have found some liquid in the phone. They are charging me around 6000/- rupees. I said please give my phone in the working condition as I had given .  I feel some faulty piece has been given to me.

"
"

  Using this phone from 3 days. Best thing about this is suoer amoled screen, massive 6000  battery. Its processor is very good even in gaming. Youtuber have put negative impact on its processor which is not true. Only very small issue i face is that its front canera add slight yellow tint to photo which they can improve with software update. üëç Go for raven black its far better than blue. Purchace phone cover immideately

"
"

  I been using m31 and this product i had purchased for my father. If u compared both its more or less same. But camera is bit downside for m21. Could have been better but again at this price i feel its ok.

"
"

  The phone is very good with all the base requirements: snappy, bloatware free, ad-free, non-Chinese brand, very good batter life and a decent camera for this price range.The one area of improvement could be a fast charger but the battery life of 2 days kind of compensates for the same. Overall a wholesome phone for anyone looking at a long term (2-3 years) phone without having to worry a lot of phone degradation or brand issues.

"
"

  Amazing product by Samsung I this range.I purchased Samsung Galaxy this time. It much better than the others I had had

"
"

  It has a big software problem , it's auto-restarting ,it will restart automatically sometimes , please samsung resolve this problem with an update asap. I am really disappointed with it.

"
"

  Review after using Samsung M21 for 2 months.It gives 2 days of battery life.And almost 2 and half hours to fully chargeCamera Quality is great.Fingerprint sensor is a bit slow.Processor is Amazing,it gives smooth/extreme - HDR/Ultra pubg settings.phone has got a stunning look and build quality.It has wifi calling feature and lots of other features.Worth buying.

"
"

  Beware now Amazon provides refurbished mobile under umbrella of new mobileI got a mobile which seems refurbished display with some scratches on sides and glue type material around itAmazon technician also admitted something suspicious in product quality and say some products can have this type of issues but prepare report product is ok this is not acceptable for me I am highly unsatisfied with amazon service regarding this product  I want replacement

"
"

  The piece I received seems to be defective, everybody is complaining that whenever they call my phone is switched off, although it is always on at my end.Utterly disapponted!!Very much dissatisfied with Samsung..ordered for the first time because I wanted to order an Indian made phone. Now, will not order again.I wanted to replace it, but the return window is closed.I want to put my sim back in my broken Xiomi again

"
"

  This phone is just awesome.It comes with a massive 6000mAh battery which lasts for 2 to 3 days for a moderate user. The camera is ok but there is no macro lens and the front camera was little bad producing average images.But I think Samsung will get rid of it through an OTA update. Display is really cool with vivid colours Amoled display

"
"

  Reviewing after two weeks of usage.It is a good product ,I got it for 9,000 rs for exchange with my old asus ZenFone Max pro M1.It would have been better if it has 25 watt fast charger instead of 15 watt charger and the processor is the drawback it is good for normal day to day usage and medium games it is not suitable for high end games like pubg etc..

"
"

  Samsung  Galaxy  M21 6GB 128 not good phone. Battery backup  is named. Is hot when I use the internet. And charging  time. First time fingerprint and facelock does not work in morning. The camera is okay same extent.but this phone is not good for games. Loudspeaker voice  does not come  clear  while talking. Phone  is not right for money.

"
"

  Im not the much good knowledge of mobile phones, However I thought SamsungM21 mobile battery would stand by for atleast 2 full day. But I don't use phone ofen, I charged phone with üíØ%, later I done wat app video call for 10 mins max. Charge drain to 70%.that's very strange. With new phone n that big battery.

"
"

  The phone is designed for media consumption, if you are expecting to do gaming then don't go for it. If all you need is basic smartphone utilities and media consumption then it is perfect for you.It has a great battery life, you can watch video for 10-12 hrs continuously.Camera quality is pretty good for 48 MP.Has a slight heating while playing heavy games but, it won't be an issue.

"
"

  Fantastic phone it has no heating problem like China's phone have....Best use for multi purpose phone ..And support pubg in HD setting nd very smooth gameplay start pubg in just 26 secI love Ittt.... First reason is that it's not a china product üòç and after that many reasons like display nd all

"
"

  User interface is superb. Touch is class and I loved it...Battery Is large but performing good not best.As a whole great phone in this range and recommended. At least when u have to buy other than Chinese product.

"
"

  No words to say this is the best budget phone ever you go for the 48mp camera is so cool it gives you amazing experience display is also good and front camera is amazing this is phone for which you can hassel free go for to gift your loved ones. Only one thing os that it gets scratches on the back but don't worry you can use back cover for it. I am using it from a month without a single complain. It's easy to handle,slim body and cool looksIt's a monster.

"
"

  There is a serious problem with Adaptive brightness in this phone, there's no dedicated light sensor, it uses front camera as light sensor which is not so much responsive. You have to change brightness manually if you don'twant to burn your eyes. I am regretting my decision to buy.

"
"

  Camera: 7/10After 5 days of usage.Look n feel: 8/10Processor speed: 8/10Charging: 6/10Battery life: 10/10Multimedia: 10/10Multitasking: 9/10Best phone under 15k for multimedia consumption... Dolby Sound n SAmoled screen.. great combination

"
"

  First of all I would like to inform that there is network issue in this mobile that is very bad at the price segment of above Rs. 150000/_. Internet is also slow. I hv kept this mobile because of the network issue of the Airtel but later found that it is device issue. What to do if I wanna replace it??

"
"

  I am using this since a month..I just luved the display..Performance is good for my usage..Camera is awesome in daylight or good lighting conditions and it cannot perform well in low light due to it's high aperture...Battery is ok in starting few days but after few charging cycles it is excellent,no draining issues found.....Overall my rating is 4.8/5Better to go with this if you are planning on for a device under 15k budget

"
"

  Worst piece ..I bought this mobile on july 17th .. today date is august 25 ..my mobile is not charging ...if i connected another mobile with same charger ... charger is working but mobile is not chargingIf i went to samsung service point .. tha service is worst ... my mibile was idle from 10 days...Never expected this kind of service and this kind of product from samsung

"
"

  Superb phone with this price. I bought this phone at 15499.the only thing is u need to protect ur phone by tempered scrren guard and back cover as body is plastic type and can get easy scrates...Battery charges very slow takes around 4 hour to full charge from 0 to 100.though it comes with 15watt fast charger... Not meant for pubg lovers as phone get heated up soon... Rest overall its awsome phone.6 gb 128 gb.

"
"

  I bought 6Gb|128Gb variant and it is the Best non Chinese Phone in 15k.In case of display quality, there is no comparison with Samsung.Camera is also great in this phone , super slow motion mode gives awesome video. Processor works pretty well and I had never found any lag while playing PUBG.In case of battery, it works well 1 &1/2 day without playing any game .Only 15w charger gives me frustration.

"
"

  This is a great smartphone with awesome features. The best part is the battery. I have been using this phone for about a week and there's not a slightest problem with the battery. The 15W charger works better than I thought and is fast enough. Camera is great. 48 Mega Pixels works awesome and the Ultrawide Sensor just astonished me, it captures a lot. At this price range, I think that this Smartphone is the BEST BUY.

"
"

  Overall phone is good. First 2 days it becomes hot after doing work calling and in charging. But I wait for 4 to 5 days and then it becomes normal . Touch screen is very sensitive and phone is light in weight.

"
"

  The best and the most amazing feature is the battery life. I charge it 100% once in the morning and then use it the whole day. Even after that at night it just goes down to 70%.The camera quality is just awesome. The 48MP pics are beyond beauty. The live focus feature of camera gives photos like that of a DSLR. The fingerprint reader is also very adaptable. The ram and memory functioning are also too good. Overall, it is more than the worth of it's price.

"
"

  Good smartphone  in this price range,1- fingerprint sensor is fast2 -good rear camera quality, front comera quality is not good really disappointed,I expected more please improve it3 - Battaery life is very  good it's lasting  30 hours to 48 hours as per ur use ,I m not a game users,charging time 0 to 100% takes 3 hoursI m using  it since 45 days not hanging yetSuggested  to buy  please don't go for any chainese brand

"
"

  Great mobile under 15000 rather i should say the BEST one.Camera - Excellent Quality both rear and selfie camera. Also it has a wide selfie  option which is attractive.Battery - I just Love the battery life 6000 mAh easlily 33 hrs backup.Performance - No heating and Games can be played smoothly.Top quality screen and Design.I suggest buying this if you are looking for under 15k option.It is a VALUE FOR MONEY mobile phone.

"
"

  Good value for money phone.2 great things about this phone are battery and display.I guess very less phones (under ‚Çπ15k) give super Amoled display which gives a great viewing experience altogether and battery which can certainly last for more than a day and half.The only thing I can recommend Samsung is that they should have Qualcomm or Mediatek processor as they will make the user experience more fluid.Anyways not a bad phone as far as I have used.Thanks!

"
"

  I have used this product from last 10 days and yes its Nice Product. Loved that Samsung has provided such a good features in mobile. It is very smooth and very well functional. Just one thing I got disappointed with camera. Specially the front camera. It is not as clear as expected. Night mode is nice. I am ok with it .comparing to other mobile brands you are providing good specification in such price.Thank you please work on camera. üôÇ

"
"

  Battery life is so good , a full day pubg at low graphis extreme frame rate , nice camera but sucks a bit in low light , selfiesaaa brilliant , slow mos a perfect even at night time ,lag free using ,.camera perfomance could be better.best monile from samsung at 14000rupees... perfect for movie lovers ,,, and also travellers ,because of long battery life u can go stress free for 2 days and more only for phone calls and social media chats battery stands for 3 days

"
"

  It's a nice smartphone a bit overpriced but it's okay...the camera quality is just decent battery gets heated pretty much when used and the display quality is crisp and produces good colours...all an all a good phone

"
"

  Battery life, camera and the screen display and the color combinations are the best. Such fantastic phone with wonderful features at such economical pricing is the biggest plus point. Only one minor issue is the inability of the default Samsung widget  not getting updated. Please address this issue to make this model truly spotless. After system update, the issue is resolved and the Widget also got updated. Thanks for this wonderful phone.

"
"

  I got it delivered to me on June 9th. It has been almost two months and there is no immediate flaw that I can feel. Absolutely your best bet in this price range.Battery life is amazing. I use it for over 12 hours at times with almost no breaks and it still manages to survive at around 40% by the time I am done.Camera is also pretty great. Just the finger touch sensor is a little off. There is no lagging or heating problem that I went through either.

"
"

  Everything is superb But the processor should've been a snapdragon proccesor, fingerprint reader didn't meet expectations, face unlock requires a huge amount of light, fast charging should've been 22W for its Monster 6000 mah battery. The two things excellent about this is its launcher and camera quality. The 48 MP takes too much of time to process, and ultra wide shots met more than expectations

"
"

  Superb product... value for money...The battery backup is very awesome...Camera n modes make this phone premium... highly recommended...The only one thing which I want to say the Internet speed is not reach as much faster than other phones

"
"

  I got my piece 4/64 variant on 16th july and after thorough  usage i am saying it's a monster mobile in that price segment. RAM management is good , back camera 48mp is superb and front camera in low light is average. 6000 mah is  good and easily after a day long usage it comes down to 25-30 %

"
"

  Using 6GB/128 wrting this review after using 3 months..First there is heating problem while normal using the phone and also while charging its get heat up. This is very bad thingSecond battery life is very bad even it have 6000mah power worst more than the 3500mah battery.Third face camera quality not good.Fourth it get stuck or stop working for a while.Samsung Should improve the same.

"
"

  This is for people with tight budget and who needs big battery life...M21 is made for u but for others there are few cons like screen slow to response..network bad ...sometimes front speaker doesn't work ...slow chargingPros are big battery,great display and nice speakers ..good for gamingBuy it if you don't want to spend more

"
"

  All of a sudden it has starred showing battery issues. Charge gets drained pretty fast. And there are issues on network whichever service provider you take. Internet is being able to use but unable to make incoming or outgoing calls. Not issue with network provider but with phone. I have tried using different network providers but no luck.

"
"

  If you want a best budget phone under 15k with outstanding performance then go for it .I am using Samsung Galaxy m21 for 2 month. The camera is a monster.I played PUBG in this,I didn't feel any lag or frame drop.I got almost one and half day battery and when I play PUBG for 1 hour it will only decrease 10% of battery. The fingerprint reader faster and facelock is also for this price. If you need better option over this then go for m31.

  Very very sad received defective product does not work properly hangs a lot and its screen working automatically I didn't expect this from samsung I have used Redmi phones but never got product like this I was expecting very good quality and its effects me so much. Complaint regarding this product and Amazon representative does not providing solutions. Very bad day for me. I don't know what I m going to do with this defective product. Consumer complaint??

  ¬†Extream level phone. 2 day Battery lifeIlove the phone. It is branded in Samsung. All features is available. But the despoiment thing is it's processor but its working the games overall it's good. And this phone is supper ammo LED Display .and dolby atmos is available. Wifi calling is available. Camera quality good. 4k support. In my opinion The Samsung m21 is a VALU FOR MONEY product.

"
"

  Too much heating, while charging, while answering call, while using wifi, while using youtube. Basically worst mobile designed by Samsung ever. I tried to return the Amazon simple escapes that they dont have policy for return. I'm not at all happy with AMAZON and THIS SELLER. Please dont waste your money and dont waste your time.  I'm not going to use this phone further and put it on dust bin.Worst product, Bad support form AMAZON and SELLER.

  I like it bcoz it is a good long lasting backup 1+1/2day work easily along with sufficient storages ram and internal . Picture also coming good specially slow motion . And it's come in my budget 15k.Some extra fiction was there specially which was that I can save any what's up status of any body,when I purchased it. But unfortunately this function have been removed after updating my phone.

"
"

  Battery life awesome once you charged it will run for approx. 1 day, built quality is not so good, camera is awesome. Once you buy this handset you are not going to regret it,so many new features is introduced by the Samsung and i am happy with that. And also this handset is not good for high gaming. Value for money and i recommend you guys if you are planning to buy this handset don't think to much just buy it. üòÅ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  Wanted to buy a new phone in 10-15K range but didn't want to go for chinese brands.So Samsung M21 checked all the boxes and we bought it. Much better than the Redmi series. In all aspects.

"
"

  First of all .... No argument... its an extraordinary phone..it's a great phn for 16k..... Hell of a phone for gamers.... And battery backup is awesome...And the display is out of the worldAs a gamer ... I AM SATISFIED The charging time.......it takes 2 and half hours to full charge

"
"

  Volume and power buttons are on the same side...and sometimes it confuses. Otherwise from my two week experience,Battery life - so far goodCamera quality- goodFingerprint reader- good experienceDisplay- excellent..and I like blue light filterStorage - too good for my workWeight and size - handyFor me it is worth money and high utilityAnd I Always prefer Samsung for durability

"
"

  Inahve used Mi phone earlier for about 1 year..if I compare both Samsung M21 is not less than others brand in term of software interface but 2 üåü for hardware.. hardware quality is plastic which doesn't look beautiful. Fingerprint sensor should be little below for easy biomatric unlock. Rest everything is ok.

"
"

  Love the phone, battery life, turbo charging, camera options are all great. The only couple of aspects that I am not happy with is the length of the travel adapter chord and the finger print scanner.... otherwise...the phone is absolutely bang on target..value for money.

"
"

  ¬†I have been using Samsung brand mobile since 5 years, so I know the quality..this year I decided to buy new mobile nd again i went with Samsung nd got this monsterüòç..Come to this mobile..it has very good display nd battery. camera quality is too good..finger print sensor works very well..till now I haven't faced any hanging issues.. it has good look..over all I love itüòò

"
"

  Wish to give feedback to my fellow online shoppers in very wasy understandable way!!!1. Excellent battery backup (>1 day)2. Very good camera.3. Nice width to height ratio of mobile4. Value for money (6GB Ram, 128GB storage)5. Good audio quality6. Good features- finger print sensor, wifi calling, new andriod etc

"
"

  Worst phone. Don't buy this.Camara quality is very poor.Display yellowish.Battery charging time is too high, It drains very fast.Poor quality charger.Fhd video clarity not good.Original invoice not received

"
"

  I had bought this product a while backI paid 15999 for it...In the 1st day itself I noticed it hangedWhile attending phoneAnd textingI updated the software but still it hangedMy honest opinion is not to buy this phoneThank god for amazones swift and professional staff who guided me and refunded me cash as soon as I returned it backThank you AmazonAnd samsung I'm very disappointed.

"
"

  Listen to me carefully guys ...I bought it for my long battery life need....And believe me this is a disaster...Because it is very much unrealistic to charge a phone for 3 to 3.5 hours... It feels irritated guys ...Also it has a very very poor battery life like just 6 to 7 hour when operated......So Plz don't buy this phone..Coz I'm not a rough user.

"
"

  This mobile is one the best at this price, the look is stylish and elegant. The camera quality is awesome and comes with a number of modes including Slo-mo and Super Slo-mo. The display of device redefines super HD as I played games like PUBG with high graphics. The phone doesn't heat after 4-5 games. The battery life was not quite that good as expected according to 60000 mAh.

"
"

  Received the device in impeccable condition, the 6000mAH battery is the plus point of this device, u dont need to worry about regularly charging, AmoLED display is sharp n crystal clear, Camera is also worth satisfying as u can take sharp n crisp pictures..The only thing that has drawback in this device is its plastic body, considering this phone is a mid level one..Samsung needs to look in different ways to change its plastic body..otherwise its a good phone.

"
"

  Like:. Superb Screen Display, very good camera, does not open shortcuts during lock screen even in the pocket, user friendly features..Dislike: 6000MAH battery is not performing like 6000mah, camera speed is not so fast.

"
"

  Bad battery, sometimes finger print reader doesn‚Äôt work, camera doesn‚Äôt seem to be of 48 MP, again Samsung has poor network connectivity which is causing problems in internet access and calling .... so all in all this phone is not at all good

"
"

  It is a good phone to be gifted for elder people. Without gaming and normal usage of hotstar,youtube and watsap ..it easily lasts around 3-3.5 days on single charge.It does get warm after an hour of continuous usage ..but for youths the phone will last around 1-1.5 days...it is gud phone if battery backup is priority and you dont do gaming.Display is execellent and camer is above average.  overall a gud phone.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is seriously best phone which is surprisingly with in the budget of a middle class person. It's camera quality is excellent and clearity is mind blowing. The best thing about this phone is the picture quality after capturing is so realistic that you can even feel that event again. I really recommended this phone. Plz check out some samples of its camera quality.Hope you may like it

"
"

  This is a quality product from Samsung. Battery life is too good to believe, lasts all day even after playing games, music and videos.Camera quality is decent. I'm not much of a photographer, but I found the camera good at clicking all kinds of pictures.Sound quality is also astounding with a loud but clear sound.GPU does a good job while playing games. Best part is that the phone does not heat too.Thank you Amazon and Samsung.

"
"

  This is my second try to get a samsung m-series phone, and even then it has proved that the phone will misbehave after a couple days, previously I bought samsung m31, the result was the same, phone will touch on its own..and now I bought samsung m 21 and I observed the same, please do no go for it, you will be having better options at this price...believe TOUCH WILL BE A MAJOR CONCERN if at all you choose this!!

"
"

  Camera: Very GoodFinger Print : Very GoodDisplay: very GoodBattery: It is 6000 MAh but performing as expected in a day with our much battery is completely Drained.Weight: Slightly heavyBrowsing: while browsing merely half an hour upper portion of mobile become hot.Overall: Good Mobile in this price range

"
"

  Used phone you had given worst experience of Amazon. When phone opened Facebook account was already activated with the name of Abhijeet Birawdkar. Wont dare to purchase costly items thru Amazon.I was desperately need of mobile so dint returned orelse I would have returned this phone.

"
"

  Worst phone...much more heating problem....during camera run it raises heat on upper side of screen...nd also when we use net there is a problem of heat.......worst phone my money is waste on buying this type of worst phone.....plz don't waste ur money on buying Samsung gadgets...trust me

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 has super display and amazing battery backup .Fingerprint scanner is okay , Camera quality needs to improve , Software experience is awesome ,One UI 2.0 is good and handy for elders .Exynos 9611 is a good SoC but not for heavy gaming .If charging speed is also good then M21 will be an all-rounder but it charges very slowly because of massive 6000mah battery but the battery backup is best in segment

"
"

  Nice productIt's Indian not chineseI want to tell u thatPlz don't take any chinese product it's harmful to our indiaLike corona virus to all worldAnd this product fingerprint reader is niceBut camera quality also greatAnd it's battery is mind blaster

"
"

  I was looking for a budget phone which is not Chinese. I just came across this. I've used samsung galaxy phones before and I used to think they all are same. But I am really impressed with my purchase. Battery life is awesome. Camera quality is too good with latest features. Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't  work. But overall it's a very nice phone with all the features that are there in phones worth 30k or more. I would definitely recommend buying it.

"
"

  It's phone is awesome. ...battery life is much good....I can't believe that camera quality is very very excellence...you can easily crop the document like as camscanner clarity...fingersprint reader is much  fabulous....I want to give the review about this phone...5 star out of 5....I purchased two m21 mobile phone last 2 month....one is for me and another is one for my bro...why becouse this phone is much attractive...

"
"

  A great product by Samsung.Huge battery with fast charging. 80 minutes and it gets charged fully.I am a gamer and battery lasts 2 days without any question.Delivery by Amazon was 1 day before estimated delivery. Get service and great packaging.Now I haven't found any negetive till now. All positive in this budget. I prefer Samsung over all.

"
"

  I bought samsung m21 6gb mobile from amazon. Amazon sent me a bad phone. After 3 days, the touch of the display of this mobile has deteriorated. I aplly used my amozen app for mobile replacement on August 15, but amozen did not replace my phone. Bad mobile and bad amozen service.

"
"

  After spending 14k hard earned money this is what I got back case with scratches. Extremely disappointed. Not happy with the service.

"
"

  After 2 months of use its good in terms of performance and battery backup but the build quality is poor especially the BACK PANEL, on which dust seems to settle permanently if used with a back cover. It doesn't come off especially on the edges and looks very ugly. And takes 2.5-3 hrs for full charge

"
"

  Everything is fine, as per expectation. The only drawback is that it heats up a LOT in the following cases:- When there is a low signal.- When I do multitasking - when we run multiple apps at the same time.This is unexpected from such a reputed brand. Samsung has highly disappointed me. I would think 100 times before buying any of their product now.

"
"

  The phone is having good features compare to other model phones and the price is also very reasonable. In this price a good phone - purchased 7 days before only battery life need to be check  - it gets consumed in one day.  All the other features are really nice.

"
"

  Best phone in this segment. Massive battery, amoled display, light weight , good camera. Where as other brands are giving IPS LCD display, Samsung is giving  super Amoled displays. Go for it except those who want to buy phone only for PUBG or any other high end games .

"
"

  It's a pretty phone in this medium budget segment. I can say it's a value for money. The camera quality is awesome both front and rear but one thing, the upper part of the body at the back along with the face of camera at the rear becoming hot after taking few shots.The sound quality is good and it is awesome if played in Bluetooth headset. Have multiple features and very easy to use and have a nice grip if you put a back cover.Overall good but the camera is becoming hot.

"
"

  Just 2 days gone after phone was delivered. So these are first impressions...Pros:1. Excellent screen display.2. Face recognition and finger print sensors respond quickly.Cons:1. The battery charging cable is too short !2. The phone has bloatware apps, and worse is that we cannot uninstall some of them. Few apps like 'Facebook' and some Samsung apps cannot be uninstalled! That's bad!

"
"

  This mobile is wat you call as value for money.It's the best budget mobile and as a matter of fact it doesn't feel like a budget phone it feels like a premium ‚Çπ100000 phone. It's successor  SAMSUNG Galaxy m31 is just the same phone with a camera upgrade so I feel m21 shld be good. I have the 6GB RAM version which is excellent for gaming but I am not sure if 4GB RAM version is good for gaming. And it is very fast with no lag.

"
"

  Good phone with excellent battery backup and superb samoled display but At first it lack in signal strength but after update [29th July] it improved and it has little bit heating issue when your surrounding is hot (this summer times) and if you want to buy 4gb ram varient then u get only 1.7 gb ram free for apps so, think about it. Storage speed is excellentread speed - 352mbpsWrite speed - 186mbps

"
"

  Camera is not up to mark , main problem is network issue , net speed is too slow , sim is perfectly fine in all other phones , but speed in Samsung is too slow .Battery is also myth , only last 9 hr .I want to exchange for another Samsung M21 , help me out seller .... because I think this device has this problem, I saw the YouTube , there review are good .

"
"

  1. CAMERA PERFORMANCE IS EXTREMELY GREAT2. GREAT DISPLAY3. REMARKABLE BATTERY LIFE4. BEST GAMING EXPERIENCE ( NO ONE HAD EVER IMAGINED TO GET HDR GRAPHICS WITH EXTREME FRAME RATE IN SUCH PRICE RANGE)5. GREAT BUILD QUALITY6. FAST FINGERPRINT RESPONSE7. DOLBY ATMOS ACTS AS A BOON FOR MUSIC LOVERS8. PHONE PERFORMANCE IS ALSO OUTSTANDING9. VERY BEAUTIFUL BODY DESIGN

"
"

  I have been using samsung m21 for more than 2 months now.To be honest it is really 'WATTA MONSTER' in terms of battery,camera,the quality display with a decent sound level.It is best for day to day usage but it just has problem in terms of heavy gaming.If you talk about anything except gaming it will satisfy you in all ways.If you are looking for a phone to steadily do your daily work you have found the best in the market!!!

"
"

  First purchase from amazon....Adjustable performance in gaming....Not for pro gamers..I play pubg minimum of 10 erangal everyday..First week battery will feel like 3000mah or 4000mah,  but later battery will be the best..Camera not really great, expecting good quality in coming updation.... weight lesss... Overall im proud to use a non chinese phone...  and all my family members are using samsung

"
"

  First we just run after configuration but now we can also enjoy OneUI experience, humongous battery backup. Cherry on the pudding we get sAmoled Display. We can see the screen of difference. Experience of watching content on this sAmoled screen is awesome.üòçüòç

"
"

  Excellent phone.I am reviewing after 1 month of use and till now it is working perfectly. Nice camera, Longlasting battery life and powerful fingerprint security.Best phone ever.Last I would like to thanks Samsung for such an excellent phone.

"
"

  Mobile is good in all level.Only drawback is screenshot options not available on top menu.Have to use power button and volume button simultaneously to screenshot.If add screenshot option on top menu bar, will be fantastic.

"
"

  REVIEW AFTER 5 DAYS OF USE:--Display is simply super, best for movie lovers.-camera is also good according to price-battery backup 2days on normal use, 1 day in heavy usage.-intermediate gaming.-one UI is also a plus point-RAM management is also decent.-fingerprint sensor is very fast but a little bit slow face unlock-fast charging is not that fast it took almost 2.5hours but not a big problem because of 6000mAh

"
"

  This is just a very average phone, I see lags while switching between apps. Camera processor has some bugs because of which sometimes I just get complete BLACK photos, also the camera is slower. I feel there are so many better alternatives in this price range. And even the fingreprint reader fails to read many times.

"
"

  At the time of purchase of the item, I have selected my credit card as well as EMI scheme but when I have checked my bank account and found it has not been activated, would request you to kindly do the needful as in this pandemic time, I was not in a position to buy a phone for pay cut but I have purchased because my previous phone was not working and chooses EMI option which you have provided. Please convert my purchase in EMI.

"
"

  Yes this is more than anything in a budget segment.Some mobiles makes viewing experience worse even if you are watching a high quality video but SAMSUNG M21 is just opposite to that.  1. Good and long lasting Battery  2. Best camera quality  3. An amazing sound quality  4. A very Smooth user interface  5. More than value for money  6. And M21 is a perfect all rounderWhat else are you waiting for?????

"
"

  I opted for the Battery backup to resolve a powerbank carrying issue but i got a Good camera resolution with great RAM & memory support (for 6GB,128GB internal) in this price point .. the display is always a fan making ASP for #samsung ,i also had a TAB S previously.the more promising .. #MADE IN INDIA

"
"

  Phone screen started flickering off and on from day 3 or so, and had a patch of black screen a few days later. Amazon return policy ended a day before flickering started. Samsung care brushed their hands off the item, saying the phone had fallen(which it had not), and so warranty is void. Had to spend an additional 5500 rupees to repair the screen.Beware!! Buy these samsung models with extreme caution.

"
"

  This phone is another definition of perfection.As SAMSUNG means ""three stars"" this phone is a star in itself. The display and Dolby gives u heavenly experience while binge watching.Awesome camera it takes catchy pictures .Pleasant speaker. Fingerprint sensor  is amazingly fast. Biometrics work with speed of light. Touch gives u a fine feeling. Nothing can defeat MONSTER BATTERY. Everything is awesome . No fear SAMSUNG'S here.JUST GO FOR IT.

"
"

  This Mobile is best in terms of battery life and a decent camera. I am not a gamer but trust me one full day charge of the phone last till the day with good amount of mobile viewing whether it's youtube, facebook or Netflix..I don't need to get it charge every time. With its super smoked display I get vivid picture.

"
"

  Best phone for this price range.It has the best display with long lasting battery life.It also supports gaming for mid users.The fingerprint reader and face unlock allows you to unlock it quickly.Also,it has 48mp primary camera and camera quality was awesome.But the phone comes with a plastic body though performance stands ahead while the built is secondary thing.Overall this is a good product from Samsung.

"
"

  Battery life of the phone good. But it takes too long to get charged like 1.30 minimum. And battery quality is that usual like your redmi phones.. nothing more to expect. And it gets hung .. I ve bee. Using this phone since a month now. And it's already gets hung I I open some 5 apps.. like whatsapp. Gpay. Google search and play songs and one game. That's all..it gets hung..  u need to lock and unlock once.

"
"

  Got the device one day before itself üòä.... The display is gorgeous and the Ui is buttery smooth... Some bloatware is pre-installed (Can be Uninstalled) . The battery is lasting for 2 days on a single charge... But it takes over 2 and half hours to completely charge the device... Fingerprint reader is accurate and fast. Camera is decent for the price. It doesn't feel that heavy as one would expect as it has 6k Mah Cell... In love with the device üòç

"
"

  Defective piece received. Mobile do not  switch on  why  5 hours charging but not  turn on. Please replace the mobile

"
"

  Yes! Fingerprint sense is faster than I expect.Camera - the brand 'Samsung' again proved the quality of the feature, especially the wide angle mode gives excellence feel (can give 5 start to camera)... but I'm little bit disappointed with battery. Though I charge completely (100%), I can use the device for a single day (may be 18 to 20 hours)... other inbuilt features are good. üòäü•∞

"
"

  This product was purchased on 20th June 2020, but after some days phone screen is showing blank automatically I also went to Service center but there was no positive response. This phone is neither dropped nor suppressed nor any external damage is done, yet service center is telling my mistake.I'm going to complaint against this company in the Consumer Court, and I tell you also, Don't take this product again, this is totally waste of money.

"
"

  I bought this phone considering that it is a non chinese brand, i bought in on 4th june 2020 and on 12th july 2020 its screen has totally blurred and horizontal line have appeared on it...i decided to give samsung a try after almost a gap of 6 years and it still has disappointed me a lot!!....even after spending 3-4k extra on the phone as compared to chinese brands, i am getting this kind of service..its pathetic!!

"
"

  Screen protection is very poor...also after breaking the screen samsung service will charge around Rs.5,500/- for replacing the screen....After replacing my old mobile and switching into this Samsung mobile, suddenly I started facing Network related issues like Call drop, no data etc...Really really disappointed....

"
"

  A very nice build..... screen quality is amazing ..software not supporting secure space, floating menu, screenshots not in slider or three fingerscrolling screenshots these features available in every other brands.. Camara is average.... battery life as said in the description is 5000 but  not getting that quality.... some time it still hangs .... but I purchase Samsung for the durability and hardware quality....let us see

"
"

  I use it for my daily use as primary phone. (6GB/128GB varient)What I like:Display : colors are vibrant.Battery : last for 2 days in normal usesWhat I didn't like:Auto brightness does not work consistently.Camera is good but not as per competition from Mi And Realme in same budget mobiles.Noticed minor hung.

"
"

  I can guarantee you this that this smartphone is worth your money. And I myself ordered this my second M21 within a month of usage. I really loved this smartphone in every aspect that I ordered this second phone for my mother too. The camera quality is awesome with large battery and still it takes very less time to charge it. Fingerprint reader is also accurate and fast too.I always love Samsung and now I'm more into it.

"
"

  This is a beat phone in this price segment.I'm really happy with the performance of this phone. I'm not worried anyone about the battery life, easily it can last more than a day. Camera also superb. It can take wide angle shots as well as night mode also work nicely.... Screen quality also superbIt's a perfect phone for person like me who is found of watching movies and webseries.. I'm enjoying this phone seriously

"
"

  Best phone for moderate users . Fingerprint sensor is good. Battery life is superb  . After full charge  you can use it for almost  30 hrs( moderate usage).Samsungs ui  is too good. Camera is averageCharging speed is not much fast  ,it takes 2 hr 40 min for full charge ,charger should be atleast of 25wIt can handel  2 - 3 hr of gamingLook wise not much good from outside ( simple polycarbonate body )Exynos processor is ok ok

"
"

  Battery is good ....camera  is not that much good when its comparing with Redmi phones  .. processor is good and speed ...but within 3 days my phone's system is stuck sometimes  ...even when i didn't use it for long time...  And I didn't  get any hard copy invoice  with delivery  ... I get only soft copy

"
"

  Super product,1. Phone was so nice2. Nice Camera3. Fingerprint is good4. Super Display quality5. Other Features are goodBut1. Battery life is not good, draining Fastly if it's in idle.2. Network IC issues.3. Heat issues, it's like a Ironing Box .I expecting this all issues are resolves in feature. It's possible in hardware and software updation.Thankyou for spending to read this review.

"
"

  The phone is really a nice piece of device for people who uses their phone for calls mails and stuff like that. But if you want to take good photos then this device is definitely not for you. The camera fails(not even struggle) in low light or indoor condition. With this camera I actually got to know how important after image processing is. I have a 3 year old device with 8mp front camera,  and believe me its better than the 20mp on Samsung m21.

"
"

  Battery performance is very bad. Drains out completely in less than 24 hours. Moreover the product will not be replaced/returned by AMAZON even if you put up replacement request. They will ask you to re-calibrate the battery and will convince you that it is normal that battery will be discharged within 24 hours. It seems that I had done a mistake by opting for buying it from AMAZON.Amazon have started to befool customers which is not at all expected.

"
"

  Worst Mobile.I purchased this phone in aug.2020. I used it so delicately,After one month of use screen display got damaged without fell down or screen pressed.very poor quality. I used MI note 3 for last four year there was no problem at all. worst thing is all Samsung service center has server  problem in noida. After sales service is pathetic. Not recommended üëá.

"
"

  This is a worst product by samsung mobile because it's network connection is very bad and slow from other mobile.processor is not fast comparing to redmi or other phones.Amazon give me a bad product it have complaint.Amazon cheat enthey do not provide return option.I will never forget this cheat from Amazon and I will not purchase any item from Amazon please return this complaint product and give me a good item..Please it's my request to Amazon

"
"

  When I buying this mobile I saw so many negative comments but I dare to buy this mobile because brand samsung and amazon after purchase i like the product wellIt's to up to mark and brandBattery backup is goodCamera quality goodFingerprint also goodSamsung trusted brandAmazon also done good job delivery fastThanks Amazon and samsungThis all are prosI will update cons later

"
"

  Its only 7 days to but this mobile and battery is heating during charging.  Camera quality also not as like of 48 mega pixel. Have asked for replacement and review again.Even my replaced phone is hanging in same day, always showing connecting call but couldnt. a lot of connectivity issues. also battery heats when on charging and charging takes a lot time.

"
"

  ¬†This device is value for mony by samsungAnd camera is awasome 48 mp camera beat  other 64 mp cameraGaming is best in this seagment hdr support but in smoot and extrem is good graphic setting for itBig battery have long screen time and unlimited entertainmentAmazing in this mobile 6.4 inch superamolade display one of the best in this price rangeI give out of 5 star this mobile

"
"

  When did i purchase this product, I have availed NO interest charges option ( available on Amazon) site. however when i checked my back stmt there are Interest levied by Bank, also there was GST imposed on Interested amount.Total additional Monthly charges141.17 +25.41 = 166.58Total additional charges = 166.58*6 = 999.48/-

"
"

  Best phone you can afford in this price. Battery life is excellent. Even camera is good, we can take awesome photos from this phone. Screen size is good, because we van easily hold this size device in our hands. AmoLED display is something which makes Samsung different from others. Overall I can say it's the best phone we can afford at this price.

"
"

  I am very disappointed  with battery because i used 4000 mah battery phone and after 2 year that phone back up is more than samsung m21 6000 mah battery which is disappointed  me other wise phone is goodBad delivery  by Amazon because my friend has also samsung m21 but its battery backup is good but my new phone backup is less then a day on stand by

"
"

  This mobile limited features ,didn't fulfill my requirements as I want ...there is no app lock available in this mobile. Some other features are also unavailable...I'm not happy with this phoneüòî

"
"

  Samsung m21 superb smartphone in that price.Camera quality is good.Picture quality , dynamic range, saturation color, night mode is good.Display is superb.Battery performance is excellent.Fingerprint is fast, but sometimes it hv problem to read the fingerprint.Loudspeaker on call is good, It wd hv been nice if the loudspeaker was a bit louder.Call speaker is excellent.

"
"

  I think my device has problems with the sensors, auto rotate doesn't work properly I have hard time to put it from portrait to landscape mode or vice versa. The touchscreen is sometimes very sensitive or very less sensitive, it sometimes works or sometimes doesn't. The good thing about it is playing games was a nice experience for me, display is quite vibrant, fingerprint sensor is fast, camera is superb.

"
"

  It has been 3 days I bought this phone...Its okay for light use I suppose.But seriously... 6000mAh ?? You are kidding...I had moto one power before...5000mAh gave me almost 2days...Same user, same usage.. now its giving me less than 24hours with 1000mAh more...

"
"

  Battery takes very long to chargePoor quality pictures even with 48mp camera

"
"

  Finger print reader is really bad.....battery gets charged very very slow in comparison to redmi.......camera quality is worst......also sound quality is bad...... don't buy it....

"
"

  Hi it's a good product for the price. I purchased on Amazon and using it since 1 month. Battery life is good and camera quality is too good. Much of the apps I don't use but for my usage it's a great one.

"
"

  There is only one word to describe  this product  Excellant.  Battery  life outstanding. Compared to earlier mobile where I used to charge at least twice a day  now I am charging once in two days. Voice clarity is too good. No signal drop. No heating problem. Camera photos are really good. Value for money. Simply go for it

"

  Using it for 2 months now.....Display is superb .... Provides the best video experience in this range....Processor is fine ... I never ran into any lagging issues However haven't tried this with heavy games...Camera can be better....!Battery is very good... And runs for 1- 2 days with average uses.... However it takes around 100 minutes to full charge .... Which works well for me...

"
"

  It Take a lot Of Charging Time my phone was 47% then I  plug charge and after 4 hour charging it still 69%It takes 10 hour to charge fullWrost charger

"

  This phone is just amazing, whether it's camera, battery, fast charging (18 W). But one thing samsung needs to change immediately in mid range phones is processor, in means that since long time they are using Exynos 9611 & seriously needs to change..But I must appreciate service of Amazon, it's just marvellous. Just fan of service - I'll give 6 star out of 5...

  Samsung  M21 is budget phone with good battery  life. In this pendamic situation when online  classes  are going on....this phone proves extremely useful  for the kids to attend all the sessions  without interruption. I will recommend this to new buyers. Before buying there was wrong image for Samsung  phones regarding  stucks of the device..but I am happy with the functions of the phone.

  Buying a Samsung phone for the first time.. I've been using Redmi note 4 for the past two years.. Don't believe in spending more than 15k for a mobile.Btw.., so far so good! Gets heated up, though.  I played candy crush for less than 30 min & it heated up like crazy.

"
"

  After 2 weeks of use I can say there is one issue with the phone. This works slightly on the slower side, and it never gives me a feeling that it has 4 gb of ram. I have not tried playing games but then the response from the phone is slow. APPS open slightly slower. Camera and sound is good.

"
"

  It's really an awesome phone. The best thing in this phone are Its Super AMOLED display, Monster Battery of 6000mah with 15w Fast charger. It is having really awesome camera as per the price with different modes too... It also contains a Dolby Atmos Function which will enhance your music quality. I am loving this phone. Great work By SAMSUNG

"
"

  -Value for money-Great battery backup, no need to worry about battery, it lasts more than one full day, i feel very much happy when i travel without worries.- Extraordinary display in this price range- Very good call quality, and low SAR value.- Feels sturdy in hand.- And i love dual sim + seperate micro sd card slot, instead of hybrid sim slot.- I would have loved even more, if it supports to connect 5Ghz wifi.

  Samsung galaxy M21 is the latest smartphone phone to join galaxy M series. It has a crisp AMOLED Display, very good battery life and great performance. The smartphone has 6.4inch AMOLED Display. It has 6,000 mAh battery with great battery life. This phone has a triple camera setup. Dual sim smartphone with 48MP Camera. It comes with fast face unlock and a finger print sensor. A must buy smartphone with all the features.

"
"

  Writing this review after 10 days of using this phone. Battery backup is quite good but the charging the phone takes a lot of time I mean at least around 6 hours. Gaming is ok but if the phone has 6GB RAM it should had performed better. If looking for good battery backup and moderate usage i.e no gaming this phone is good , and also the back body if of plastic that lowers the standard and sometimes the touch is unreponsive

"
"

  I have been using m21 for last 15 days.battery is really a monster,front camera is average but back camera is beast in day and night mode ,SAmoled diaplay so smooth to touch and no stress on eyes,lots of features of android 10 ,even having 6000 battery it does feel heavy .i will suggest dont go for cheap chinese phones when samsung is giving u such amazing feature smartphone in just 13,999 rs.also its totally made in india

"
"

  cons:--Mobile Hanging Problem as usual in any samsung phone-Bad touch response-Otg not supporting-Slow processing while playing even a light game like ludo and carromPros:-Good Camera qualityLong Lasting Battery

"
"

  Not decent but overall good smartphone.Main concert is about to processor and One UI is lagy in this device. User easily feel freezed screen.Camera is not good in low light and artificial light condition.Performance is below average.This phone is only for who searching non-chiness smartphone otherwise we have more decent phone in price segment.

"
"

  I have been using this phone for 3 weeks now, It's performance is very good, battery life is tremendous but it takes time in charging due to its massive battery. Exynos 9611 processor do all the daily task smoothly and image processing is also good considering the price. I hope Samsung will also launch phones with snapdragon processors also. Anyway, This product is worth buying for daily normal uses (Gaming is not that good in this). Cheers!!

"
"

  A nice looking phone.Lightweight because of the plastic body. The performance is pretty good.But it doesn't feel like a 6000 mAh battery. Probably a little shy of that figure. It Drains relatively quickly than what is expected of a 6000 mAh capacity.But overall a product worth its price. Probably not good for high-performance gaming.But expect it to be durable with a low-medium usage.

"
"

  Best phone for student.Durability is not so good and cheap build quality.No glass back don't worry.Amoleds are very weak in Samsung phone but this phone is on opposite sides.Display is durable in m21.I saw durability tests.Processor is downside of the phone.Lots of lag while heavy multitasking and gaming.I don't like design.Front camera struggle little in low light.

"
"

  It is a good mobile for non pro gamers ... There is frame drop issues while playing pubg Its an all rounder without massive gaming while looking through non chinese smartphone brand its the only one with this features.The battery  life  is typical 6000 mAh  we feel that its a 6000 mAh . Fingerprint  readers are quiet okay. Camera ,we are not getting a good camera experience  . Heavy lighting is provided . But low light experience is so poor

"
"

  This is my honest review after 1 month of usage..Truly good battery it stands long and I am not gamer but I use mobile for long hoursPerfomance is also decent for its priceShould say it's worth for its priceConsUser experience for putting mobile silent and most useful tools are not that quick accessible because of bad user experience  it can be improved..

"
"

  The phone is pathetic after 10 days of use 11th day the phone stopped working , I took it to the Samsung service centre the response is very poor waited for nearly 2hours and then it is 1 month still I didn't get my phone or refund from samsung service center , online classes are running which is very hard to manage really feeling bad for taking this phone , I will edit the review after  I get my phone from service center

"
"

  This phone is not for ""GAMERS"".It is a nice phone in this budget. Best for those who don't want to buy CHINESE phones like OPPO VIVO READMI REALMI POCO.This phone has everything.But doesnt include a back cover.

"
"

  Stop charging after 10%, remove cable and insert again then again charge 10 to 20% more battery, and repeat this till 100%. What the hell is this. Return window closed 2 days ago and no samsung care near me.This problem started after 12 days of use. I got fked. Should go for redme note 9 pro. Life's 1st samsung touch phone and they fked me real hard.

"
"

  Excellent product at this price point.The battery blasts for more than 24 hours in single charge with moderate to high use. The finger print reader is very responsive. But the need to get used to the location. Camera quality is fantastic including in the low light conditions.I have already used the phone for nearly 3 months now and very happy with my decision to purchase.

"
"

  Purchased this phone on 4th of June. After 20 days touch screen and display not working properly. Went to Samsung Care and they have not accept the phone in warranty stating that some of the parts are missing. Raise a complaint on Amazon customer service still waiting for the response don‚Äôt know how long I have to wait for this. Completely disappointed with the service..My suggestion would be never brought any phone from Amazon.

"
"

  Dont get fooled by the 6000mAh battery, it pity average, infact phones from realme, redmi, vivo with 5000mAh lasts longer than this. the exynos chip is not power efficient, hene you get average battery life, otherwise its okish phone for around 10k but 13k is too much.  But if you want a samsung phone in budget, this is the only and best option.

"
"

  I felt really nice aftrr getting mobile. But after use of 1 month how all of sudden display gone automaticly. Dont know the product was original or dublicate. When qe gone to service center they ask for 5600 and thats too much. They said display doeant come under warrenty.  Please its request to amazon that please check the seller if they are selling origional or duplicate product.

"
"

  Everything is perfect  - best UI , perfect camra - its classy in looks - finger print senser so well. The only thing that bothered me is its slow charging. Only 32 percent in an hour. That's too slow. Idk if i am stuck with damaged type c cable or what ; but this is taking too long to charge.

"
"

  Very good phone at its price. Amazon has satisfied me with it's delivery service. A good budget phone by samsung. Specifically battery is awesome its more than 10 days I am using this phone. Camera quality is great with lot of added features. All in one a great phone by samsung in this price range.

"
"

  12699 is awesome price for this product. Battery life is very good. Camera is ok ok. Camera can be improved.overall feel of the phone is good. Display is top class and gives good experience. Instead of M31 or M30s or any other M series this is best including price difference.

"
"

  1. Camera quality is below average2. Battery performance is good (max. 1.5 days for average user) but charging time is more than 120 min.3. It's suitable for normal usage.4. Play heavy games like COD, but sometime facing graphical issue.5. Sound quality is below average6. Display quality is goodIt's perfect for average users

"
"

  Pros: Excellent battery life.On a single charge with a fast charger(provided with phone),it lasts more than 24r hrs.Very good CameraGood RAM,providing fast surfing.Cons: Speaker sound could have been better.Overall a very good phone in under 15000 segment.Worth a buyüëçüëç

"
"

  Battery life is very good. Stunning display. Video quality is extremely good. Performance is very smooth. Call and sound quality is also good. Overall very good and useful phone.

"
"

  This phone is the best in this price range. Battery life is long and it doesn't overheat. Processor is speedy and meets all my demand. Camera is good but not great because you are getting 48 megapixel variant but it's satisfactory. Fingerprint sensor is also fast and very sensitive. I would suggest to buy this instead of getting M31 or M31s unless you want higher megapixel camera or want to spend some money. Overall a great product 4.5/5

"
"

  A very good phone in midrange price......Camera, Touchsensor, Fingerprint are really cool. Its face recognition is awesome and I just can't get enough of its massive battery üòÖ. But, for heavy gaming performance the processor should be better as Snapdragon, but I think its Exynos processor is more than enough for users like me. Its storage is also good with great multitasking capacity. So, a great phone to have overall.

"
"

  The advertisement is way too misleading,  my Motorola G5 - 16MP camera was way better in comparison to all these 5 cameras put together.Writing this review after a month's use.0 value for money, it's just for the name Samsung customers are paying this amount for a poooooor product.The ratings start from 1 hence had to give one otherwise, if it was 0 or - option available I'd give it -5 for the camera.

"
"

  First things first this is monster for sure..Battery life is top notchCamera quality is superb as usual we find in all samsung M seriesSuper Amoled display is rich in colours you will see the actual colours on this displayBest thing about Samsung is there Ui which we can customize accordinglyAt last the best and far better mobile of the year

"
"

  Even after having 6000mah battery, the battery backup is very pathetic..even without gaming, videos playback phone didn't last one day.One UI of Samsung on this device is utterly rubbish...disabled maximum possible Samsung bloatware anf without opening any other apps, the Ram available is just 1.2GB. Doing multitasking phone lags and freezes eventually.Really poor because of Samsung addons

"
"

  Such a disgusting camera.. not at all 48 MP, asked customer care to return it... but the product is only eligible for replacement, got it checked from tech experts crom amazon and they said the camera is good..So if you are buying it for camera.. just don't but..it is pathetic.

"
"

  After Using 1 to 2 months it not Properly Functioning because amazon has Dispatched me defective product after facing the ussue in the phone samsung service center Refused to Repair my phone then i mailed amazon but there no response hate purchase Experience with amazon

"
"

  Monster battery backup. Fingerprint sensor also fine. The camera given 48 mp but honestly camera is not good as what I expected.I will give 3.5 to camera out of 5.Its worthy for price. Blindly buyers can go with this product if they have decided to buy phone at range 13k to 16k.

"
"

  Excellent product in this price range. But phone is getting warmer when charging and also in moderate usages(without playing any games). Battery life is excellent, getting almost oneandhalf days of battery life while waiting YouTube, Netflix, browsing social media and other things all day.

"
"

  The phone is really good.no overheating problems.this is my first phone and I'm very satisfied with it.great camera quality.user friendly.with many features at a less price.it has fabulous sound quality due to Dolby atmos.the battery life is amazing,better than any other phone I have used till date.both the front and main camera are awesome.There are many advanced features in settings too.another nice feature is smart view.i highly recommend this.

"
"

  I never thought that a new phone will hang so much. Lucky to be a customer of Amazon that getting it replaced within 2 days of purchase.Don't know whether to recommend or not as of now.

"
"

  I Buy it before 4 months and now wants to give its reviews as under :-1.  Camera is good.2.  Speaker are not good. Not listening 2nd person  voice properly.3.  Finger sensor is not so good.4.  Phone got over heated while use.5.  Wire of charger is very short. Please give some donations to Samsung to buy some wire for increase the length of charger.6.  Rest is OK.

"

  My hubby  gave  to me in my birthday in advanceFinger print  is apply quicklyBattery  charging very fast and drain slowlyCamera quality sun time is perfect and superb in front and backBut I feel night time especially home, front camera  is not perfect much more sun timeTouch was so smoothI love itI fall in love in my phone

"
"

  Received defective product panel was not totally closed,a gap was present in between panel and front body when received.Returned immediately on same day(27may2020)still didn't received any update when i will get my replacement back,and i was very disappointed with the customer service as being a prime member i tried calling customer service several times but no answer i got from other side.Overall product is good and budget friendly.

"
"

  Excellent service by Amazon during this Pandemic. They replaced my M21 in a day. M21 is having all features that someone can expect & imagine in such regenabel price. Camera is excellent with ultra slow motion feature. Ceiling fan rotating at >3000 RPM can be seen at 10 RPM with this feature. Can't imagine the battery life too,  it's 6000 mah battery not charged even after 3 days use. I suggest this is great mobile with exceptional features.

"
"

  Battery Performance is Really Good and Best for this price.Sleek and Slim , Look wise very classy and RavenBlack Color looks Awesome.Display is Very bright and Vivid.Camera Performance is Satisfactory and Real Good photo Quality.Ram Performance is Best.

"

  Not supporting 4G..it's an Volte only, I'm facing difficult with jio sim..

"
"

  Awesome BatteryAwesome CameraGaming is Good but I expected more in 6GB RAM and 2GB GPUCharging is kinda slow, charges to 100% in approx 2 hoursAll features of Android and Samsung's combination makes it the best smartphone here.Totally Satisfiedüòä

"
"

  Pros -Amazing batteryGood displayGood camera for the price rangeOneUI (depends on individual preference)Cons -Exynos 9611 SoC (good for regular day to day use, not amazing on intense games)Bloatware - can be deleted/disabledFingerprint reader is a bit slowNo dual Volte standby

"
"

  Best phone , features all are good, battery back up sometimes it automatically restarts ........Smart phone i bought to avoid china mobiles......nice phones for gaming also .........no battery heat .nice phone compared to redmi and all china mobiles........

"
"

  Review after 1 day usage-battery excellentFingerprints sensor not uptown d mark as compared to mi handsets.Camera have heard a lot but got disappointed after clicking image when I xom the picture get blurred. Lots of unwanted app preloaded.Handy and comfortable and screen display is as usual mindblowing.

"
"

  The phone is best among all available in the catagory .. even better than a21s,m30.. the only thing that is a little deficient in the phone is the video recording stabilizer... if you are in a car or moving vehicle the video recordings will lack stability.  But if you are not into vlogging or hard core video recording on the phone then this phone is perfect in every other aspect.

"
"

  Best product at this price better than any other phone. Made last moment decision to by this phone and hurray I was correct loved this mobile. I has some best features such as all apps can be converted in to dark mode in just one click and fingurescanner can be used to drag the notification bar which is best for me. Thanks samsung for making such product with long lasting battery life. And best part is it is made in India.

"
"

  Phone is ok but Samsung need to upgrade their UI.Its not good compared to other mobile brand UI's And camera is not upto the mark and even while playing game i feel frame drops due to exinos processor better to use snapdragon in upcoming phones

"
"

  The phone is very good. It handles daily tasks effortlessly. The screen is super Amazing.I know this is not the best spec. Phone in it's price bracket.But you won't regret buying this one as well.And the peace of mind of your security ofcourse.

"
"

  Hi all, I got the mobile yesterday and don't buy this mobile and waste your money.1. they mentioned fast charging. charging is happening slower than normal mobile2. heating issue is there.3. There is no return or replacement for this mobile.4. battery is draining like anythingAmazon is cheating like this kind of product. here after never order any electronics item in amazon.

"
"

  This is delight to own. with 6000 mAH capacity, the battery life is excellent and yet the phone is sleek. one of the reasons of going in for Samsung is the camera quality and with the triple camera feature the photos are so awesome. its TOTALLY VALUE FOR MONEY. with so many features packed in, this is worth every penny. the screen size is also perfect. this is super duper phone...

"
"

  awesome display, good battery, good camera, performance is also good(runs pubg on smooth extreme setting). OneUI is the best ui, no ads, very smooth user experience, excellent ram management. You'll enjoy watching videos on this one. For me there is just one con - heating issue while charging, hope it gets fixed with software update.

"
"

  I bought this because I had m30 s. It was giving wonderful battery backup so I decided to buy this,but this is not good because when it comes to battery it has6000mah but it doesn't seems like it has. because it's draining battery like crazzy even after switching off always on display and many more battery draining options.its draining battery even in sleep also. Overnight it will consume 20% of the charge it has.Please let me know.

"
"

  In this price range we will get many other brands phones especially chinese phones with more features. But i love samsung because samsung is a brand.not chinese. SAMSUNG IS ALWAYS SAMSUNG.Good product.. i like this phone very much. There are many good features  in this mobile... m21 is very similar to m30s.. both phones are same in look and features. The front camera of m30s is 16 mp and m21 have 20 mp.U MUST BUY THIS PRODUCT... u will like it.Go for it

"
"

  Got this phone delivered on 24th August, 2020, the charging port has stopped working within 7 days of usage.This was a birthday gift for my mother on her 50th Birthday and now the phone is not getting charged at all.I am left red faced in front of her now and she is left disheartened due to this.I want my handset changed or a full refund asap else I am going to file a complaint in the consumer court.

"
"

  It's been 7 days I'm using this handset.Honestly I'm not that much satisfied with the quality. 14k is more. I know it's Samsung but still, I felt there is alot of compromising done with the quality.  Camera is not up to the mark.. battery  is better,  but the market it as 6000mah, but actually it is 5830 mah.Before buying consider comparing. I'm happy but not satisfied.Thank you

"
"

  I liked this new phone from Samsung. Battery life is amazing. Just the charging capacity needed to be much more than 15W because it takes too much time to charge 6000mAh battery. The touch and feel of the phone is very good. Camera is amazing. The fingerprint scanner at the back is a bit of problem. My earlier phone had it in the front so it was easy to unlock without lifting the phone. But because this phone has it in the back it needs lifting. Overall a good phone.

"
"

  Call disconnection problem facing . The same problem faced with samsung m30s and now facing M21 also.And processor hanging frequently.And camera showing same object in different colours . Informed to samsung customer care nothing has done to resolve the problem .

"
"

  Not a good phone at all for the cost of 14000/-. The camera is good. The fingerprint and face recognition is really bad. Also the keyboard keeps getting stuck and apps like YouTube keep hanging. You have to restart the phone to get it working.  Quite disappointed with this Samsung phone. Would not recommend it to anyone

"
"

  It's a budget friendly mobile which comes with 6000mAH battery and 48 MP camera rare and 16 MP camera from . The thing iam really impressed  is that the feature included in the mobile are quite impressive  and wonderful because no other phone would come it this cost with a bag full of features the iOS and the ram , interface of the mobile makes easy to use for anyone  . I just simply love this gadget  and I recommend  to my circle .

"
"

  I ordered my samsung M21 on 4th July. Amazon delivered it yesterday. The look is amazing. Quality is also good. Manufacturing hardware problem is found. The alignment of the top and bottom panels is not done properly. The pda panel and thebase are separated somehow. It looks like an uneven extra surface coming out of the phone. This kind of service is not expected from a company like Samsung.  Please check your phone properly.

"
"

  The Samsung M21 design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome, Massive Battery-As a title it is obviously a monster, amazing display & great performance.Phone got delivered with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is awesome and face unlocking is fast.The Samsung M21 is great and I'm just loving it.

"
"

  I have bought sumsung phone after many years hoping it could be good phone but samsung again disappointed me a lot.They claim it has 6000mAH battery but drain like 3000mAH and it take almost 3.30hrs to charge from 10% to 90% so its fast charging is not as fast. Within 3 month data cable stopped working so went to samsung authorized services centre it took around 3 hrs to resolve my issue and replaced my data cable.

"
"

  it take 8hours to charging  phone

"
"

  The Galaxy M21 has a crisp 6.4-inch AMOLED display, It is powered by the Exynos 9611 SoC and i purchased 6GB+128GB handset which is not that much costly as compared to others handsets,It packs in a monstrous 6,000mAh battery which is it's best feature!! Camera is also great in short a phone with all features and that to at such an affordable price!! Loved it and what's more it is manufactured in our own country india!!

"
"

  I bought  this mobile on 7th August , not even a month  mobile  is not working  properly,always getting stuck. Let me get complaining now and will provide more reviews laterüëπ

"
"

  Am using this phone for the past one month. Phone camera quality is not like I expected. Speaker is very small so if am hearing the call conversation via speaker mode, output is also not like expected.  Battery life is good. Video streaming quality is good. Phone is good but not suitable for my requirement. If you're using too much of social media or watching video,this is best because of battery

"
"

  First of all the built quality is fine eventhough the body is made  up of polycarbonate plastic.The amoled display  is the usp of the M series.if the phone  is continuesly used (hotspot on, mobile data on, and screen on time of nearly 6 to 8 hours) a battery back up of one day we will get.Little bit slow to launch camera app and capture a picture when compared to other phones.

"
"

  Delivered on july14th,fingerprint reader is not much better sometimes it's not working,and battery life is comes with 5800 and it works like 4500Mah not as excepted poor in battery,camera quality  not capturing like 48mp&20mp,it is capturing like 16&8mp,and replacement is mentioned for 10days but Amazon stopped it fro 8days and iam not eligibility to return this product for this product its 9th day,Amazon plz help me to return this product

"
"

  Below average phone in this price....!Back pannel is polycarbonate.The plastic attached on the edge of the display is really bad quality!Camera quality is also bad even the front camera!Battery is pretty good, the only good this in this phone!

"
"

  In hand feel is good ..overall a monster at this price . Camera pulla out a little over saturated pics which  annoys some time but the battery back up is great..processor is good for daily purpose. However doesn't provide good long term gaming experience .keeping in mind the other features and the brand value I think it's a complete package and should really be a option for people looking for Mid range phones.

"
"

  After using 2days, this mobile went into Non-responsive mode even by using limited apps below 2GB RAM. Still in 2GB RAM remains in mobile and surprisingly getting BLACK SCREEN and below issues . This really disappointing , not sure what caused the issue .1. All of sudden mobile wen into UN-REsponsive Mode2. Not able to do any action only BLACK SCREEN.3. Even POWER OFF/ Re-start also not working:-( ;-(

"
"

  Samsung M21 is really a very good phone within 15k. I liked every feature provided in this phone except the battery life. 6000Mah battery exhausts like 4000Mah battery...!!! Though I felt no issue regarding chrging. Besides camera is superb, fingerprint reader is also superb. Mine is Raven Black, 6gb, 128gb. Looks really very stylish and classy. Phone is as fast as expected. I am pretty satisfied with this phone.

"
"

  This product is so far very good.  I bought this phone battery capacity.  Its very well maintained in my daily day life. Camera is 20 m.p when comes to quality of photos is little bit poor. May be it will update on software updates. Most importantly the fingerprint is working very well and fast. I bought this mobile for 14,000. Amazon delivered the product superfast. yes I get this phone delivered within 12 hours

"
"

  This is a really good phone. The price is quite reasonable compared to the features it has. The display is fantastic and the cameras are superb. Captures very clear photos even in lower lights.

"
"

  Worst mobile ever. Very poor voice quality both speakers and headphones has constant buzzing sound, even can't hear voice on call. Display is excellent but sound quality is very very poor. I regret buying it. And the problem started from 10th day of buying so I can't return or replace as per amazon rules and regulations.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader,Face scan work really well, 6000mah makes this phone really a monster,triple rear camera is great,live focus feature is so... good.Samsung m21 is really a monster ,at an affordable price,exynos processor gives smooth performance,amoled display is amazing,Dolby atmos sound quality,other features like blue light filter,do not disturb modes are helpful.Finally I suggest this phone ,Iam writing this after using this phone.Display size is 6+inches.

"
"

  Dumbest mobile..Too slow .At a same place and network My frnd able to view hd video and i cant even in 420.. came back to buffering age..While wathing videos.. it buffers at every 1 min..Cam shutter speed deadly slow..takes 10 times  if you need to capture a moving object.. even a puppy.Battery excellent.Amazon cant replace your phone.. asks to download an app..which predetermines your mbl is excellent.

"
"

  Its a very good phone in the budget. Been using since two weeks and had no problem. Battery life life is great as of now. Once full charged its good enough for 38hours with wifi on and playing games in interval. Good display. M not that fan of any camera but its cool. Works great

"
"

  With in 3 days of delivery touch stopped working,Screen was blinking by itself,apps were opening without touching and suddenly touch gone.I never liked samsung phone but for my mom in this budget and in this time I got no option other than Samsung but it turns into this.Though I have requested for replacement,i expect a better product now.Please dont prove us wrong on this part that online phones are not for purchase.

"

  Brand like SamsungScreen like Super AmoledBattery like 6000 MAHSensors like Face unlock fingerprintMomory like RAM 6GB Internal 128GBPrice like 15kAbove all non Chinese product.Who need some thing else...thanks Samsung.Only 1 Con-Indoor Camera results are not that perfect..outdoors good

  I wrote this product review after using of approx one monh,Battery is 100%goodScreen: super amoled is goodCamera: average ( what should u expect form this price range phone)At the time of charging phone got heatRecommended kindly switch off ur phone before start the charging.That's all, if anyone have budjet near this go for it ... Awesome üëç

"
"

  As per specs written 15 watt charger is to be sent, but only 10w charger is sent in the box.

"

  I'm writting this review after few months of use. All over this is a very good phone in this pricebrange. I bought this few months back then it was 12,700/-. The finger print sensor was a little slow. All other features are awesome, good camera. 6000 battery is very good, takes longer to recharge, but fast charger makes it better.

"
"

  Good budget phone in this segment. Multiple camera options decent pics. In this price range cant compare it with other phones above 20k as it won‚Äôt be justifiable. In this price range it gives value for money. I bought it for my mother and she seems very happy about it. Battery life is amazing. 2-3 days on one charge.

"
"

  The phone is excellent with longer battery life and good camera. I switched from iPhone because of the battery as was fed up charging the phone every few hours. I love the large screen which is proving very helpful while reading emails and messages, it causes less stress to my eyes. Overall this is an excellent phone for this price. I bet you won't regret üòÉ

  ¬†Back body plastic is not scratch resistant, my phone got scratch in one week even after using TPU case.Camera stability is poor during  recording vediio. Battery drain rate is fast. The major problem is network. Internet speed is very low as compared to my last phone. It is always running with 2G rather it should running with 4G. Finger unlock is also defective.

"
"

  The mobile is good.  The battery life is quite satisfactory.  The camera is  good and has many features.  The only disliking part is that the external speaker will not work on Bluetooth when we want to listen to Radio.  The quality of the built-in speaker could have been improved.

"
"

  Pro - I bought this Samsung Galexy M21 phone for my sister who loves to click pictures so much. Camera quality in this price is perfect and Live focus option is great. She loved this phone because light weight and easy to carry and it's touch so smooth. Finger print reader fast and smooth touch. Fast charging.Cons - 6000mah battery back up not up to the mark. The battery runs out in one or one and a half day with internet open.

"
"

  You cannot find a better camera, screen and battery in this price range. The processor might not be the best but I have used it for about 10 days now and the performance is good enough. The 6gb of ram is able to handle multi taksing easily. I am able to use split screen to listen to music alongside maybe fb or twitter without any issues. Playing pubg and CoD is also quite smooth. So overall, it is a nice device for just 15,000 rupees with everything one needs.

"
"

  There is no option in review for processor , build quality, display response,UI etc..... Don't buy this mobile....this is cheap quality mobile.... I brought this mobile insted of Mi due to china issues. But, after 10 days display not responding properly.... mobile hanging issues....I'm not gamer...... there is no appointment slot available at Samsung service centre vadodara.  So, I have to buy newmobile from Mi.

"
"

  As of now all function is working good.Now samsung is also having same price of range with other brand so better to buy samsung.

"
"

  It is an over all well balanced product with decent specs and good camera. The USP is the massive battery.Pros:-1. Impressive Battery2. Decent camera performace3. Budget-friendly4. Almost no bloatware5. Ad freeCons:-1. Fingerprint sensor works slowly (rarely)2. Charging could have been faster.Overall Experience - Good. Go ahead if you are thinking of buying this.

"
"

  Best smartphone in this range offering some important features like long 6000 mAh battery, fast fingerprint sensor, great camera and display. Phone itself is a complete package and very useful during this time. Videos are treat to watch on AMOLED HD display of this mobile which is very good compared to other phone my  friends using. Lastly size is also perfect to hold and carry. Very happy with this product.

"
"

  Friends, Samsung has now understood the people of India and have known all their demands that the consumer of India wants what. And what he sees when taking a new device. That‚Äôs why Samsung started working on the new Samsung Galaxy [M10, M20, M30] series and stopped its J series. And soon will launch the M series. This phone was made entirely by keeping the Indian consumer in mind, or it would not be wrong to say that this phone was made for the Indians only.

"
"

  Disappointed with Amazon service.But phone is really very nice its display is very good compare to other company's mid range phones.Finger scanner  is fine but not fast like Chinese phones.Camera is good .Over all performance  is very good.(After sell service  is amazing  you can take appointments to the nearest service centre through  your phone. Customer care service is always  available  for you )

"
"

  This is my honest review after 20 day usageI liked this phone. But I should say some cons alsoProsExcellent displayGood CameraFinger sensor is fastConsSometimes feel like the battery is  losing so fastNot too good for gamingThis phone is for you if you are not a hardcore gamer,  You like to see videos and you need a phone mainly for media consumption.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is the best budget smartphonethe display is outstanding,performance is stable ,OneUI is highly optimized ,the battery is amazing (I read some negative comments,but honestly I didn't face any such issue,Fast charging is 15Watt not too fast but better for longer battery life,Overall it is the recommended  smartphone to all the budget users..if you are planning to just heavy game on it then only buy from others...

"
"

  Battery life is doubtful, draining like hell, full charged battery with 6000mah power finished till night just using official work.Camera's are made to look good with software degradation but Hardware is cheaper i guess, that's y quality picture are not made.

"
"

  Very nice phoneCamera is very good in the day time and in the low light it's ok but overall it's very good.Samsung given you all the important apps and games .Smoothly running all features are goodI personally like and I will recommend all to buy this phone you will not regret after buying.üòä

"
"

  Good phone for most users. It is not recommended for heavy gaming.Software, screen, battery life and 'manufactured in india' are the strong points of this phone.Price to performance is good but there are better chinese alternatives like poco m2 pro and realme 6i at this price point.I got this this phone with sbi 10% discount so it was definitely worth it at that price point.

"
"

  I was using Samsung A7, I have purchased it during last month during prime day sale, basic features like calling, youtube, camera and battery performance is  fine but the phone is very, very fragile so you have to be very careful and after buying it immediately you have put on good case and screen guard.

"
"

  It is much better from previous samsung mobiles and far better from MI Mobiles. It does not heat during call & using internet. I have been using MI Mobiles since 2014.

"
"

  Just now got the delivery product looks fantastic front camera need improvement in low light. I'll keep update you after 1 month usage. As a gamer I never think to buy Samsung due to #BanChineseProducts I ordered this mobile and never get felt bad because this phone having very less SAR value as well so healthy mobile for Indian youth and parents. THANK YOU:)

"
"

  The best midrange phone till date.Battery life is excellent. One can use it for 2days on a full charge. Camera is very good. Very good quality of images can be achieved. Display wise I think best in class. Fingerprint reader is very responsive. Sound quality is also up to the mark. No problem in call and network related issues. I am very satisfied with it. Performance is average as compared to snapdragon processors of rivals.

"
"

  I am not satisfied with product quality. The device is not in functional condition and has developed issues of automatic deletion of data store and now after months time the screen started blinking. I showed it to customer service center, they were not helpful at all witout properly checking my device they declared that my phone's LCD has damaged. It looks like Samsung service center is intending to cheat me.

"
"

  If you are using smartphone phone then the main thing is battery but battery of this phone is not good.Its taking too much time for charging 2-3 hrs. And battery taking less time to discharge.. in a single day...No fast chargingNo full day batteryRest of thing is good in this phone except battery and what the use of phone without good battery.

"
"

  Pros1. Nice battery life.(1.5-2 days)2. Nice camera(but ulta-wide camera is not so good)3. Display is amazing.4. Good sound quality.5. Phone is light weight.6. Clean UI.Cons1. Fingerprint reader is not fast.2. Build quality is not so good.Overall it is good, value for money phone. I am very thankful to Amazon for quick delivery.

"
"

  I have been using Redmi from almost 3 years but I m ditching Redmi now and falling in love with Samsung.The great thing about this phone is the ease with you can switch with apps and ut doesnt have that annoying brower notification..I just wish the camera clarity could have been bit better..it is seema bluryThank you Amazon :)

"
"

  Liked this phone very much and recently bought the same phone again, brilliant camera, all day outstanding 6000 mah battery, great samoled display and fast fingerprint reader was well and good

"
"

  Pros: VoWiFi, batteryCons: Galaxy bloatwareDoes not allow SIM cards from other countries unless used for a day with an Indian SIM card. Took a while to figure this out.

"
"

  Best phone üáÆüá≥ , the processor is powerful, don't compare this with chinese Xiaomi/realme.For day to day practical use you need GOOD display (amoled),battery life(6000mah) And most important good UI interface.The most practical phone of this year.Just add tempered glass and back case to cart while ordering...

"
"

  This is the most affordable superemoled display phone. It has massive 6000mah battery wich last 2 - 2.5 days with normal ussage. Cameras both front and back are very good. If you are a person who consumes more Movies, Netflix, YouTube and other entertainment apps and do some casual gaming. This phone is made for you. I'm very satisfied with the phone. This is clearly a good choice go for it you never regret.

  The phone is awesome.The camera quality is too good and the battery is very powerful,goes two days without charging.It also Provides better voice clarity during calls.

  Good phone  for decent usage . Some Chinese apps present in the phone which can be uninstalled. Samsung file manager is ok. Camera is good . Battery can last up to 1.5 days for normal usage .

  The touch of the phone stopped working on 17th july. I received the product on 1st of July. They have also closed return window. What now i have option other then wasting my time at samsung store. I also dont have invoice of the phone, from where i can get the invoice.?  Rawat

  You can say they are offering premium mobile with less worth of money. Such you're getting more than what you paid in this.While talking about performance,  nothing can beat this monsterIt Worth of value, Durable Battery power, The Triple camera image Quality is best. While we talk about the speed of Performance nothing come close to this mobilehttps://amzn.to/3jVDJ4H

  After using redmi for 3 years i trusted samsung brand ,but it really disappointed me.Camera quality is not so good,After taking selfie no image comes for 1 to 2 click .Phone keeps hangingBattery backup is not so good.Full day normal usage(Without using hotspots and playing  game) discharges around 60 percent of the battery.Fingerprint sensor is very insensitive.Dont buy this product

"
"

  Good handset, with a good battery back up and amazing camera. I had previously samsung galaxy in 2016, but this samsung m21 is amazing. It doesn't hangs. Samsung has returned with amazing range and variety. Thank you samsung.

"
"

  Battery life really horrible, never expected it to drain so quickly, I feel like using 3000mAh and not 6000mAh. Don't go for it, if you prefer for battery life.

"
"

  I have bought the 128GB versionSamsung has always managed to come up with one of the best mid-range and flagshi[ phones in the Indian market Pros:1. Long battery life2. Camera3. great colors4. Enhanced processorsCons:1. Placement of the fingerprint scanner would've better2. Become too bulky even just after a protective back cover

"
"

  Excellent Battery life and the very fast fingerprint reader.There is slight variation of colour of the images captured by M21 to the original colour of the images  which was disappointment to me.and there is a problem while focusing the images.The display provides an excellent experience to watch videos.Totally it is good product for those who seeks for battery and other features like finger printer,display,ect under 14 thousand.

"
"

  I'm reviewing this phone after a few weeks of using it, and I must say I'm really satisfied with the phone in almost every aspect, battery life, built in features, fingerprint sensor and the camera quality as well. Honestly I was confused because of the negative reviews but I anyway went on to buy it and don't regret at all üòÄ

"
"

  Negative:Fingerprint scanner is not working...Initially I thought that there is some other mechanism to set fingerprint. After learning from youtube, I tried several times but fingerprint is not set.Positive:Everything is better at this price range compared to other brands. More important is as this company is Not Chinese.

"
"

  Amazing product from worldwide accepted brand again..camera quality is more gd nw ..almost class if  compared to Chinese phones ,battery life also very gd getting more power at this time even work it with full of online games on whole day there is no problems ,display is also gd .Battery 5/5display4.5/5Camera 5/5So go for it ,u will not disappoint

"
"

  Amazing phone at this price. Battery life is superb. Camera quality is good. Color catchibg is perfect but if you zoom the photo then it will become hazy due to foucs. Video quality is good. Good detailing in HD quality video. Storage is sufficient.I have taken 128 GB and I am really happy. Thanks to amazone for their service. I have got this phone withing 36 hrs.

"
"

  Awesome Non-Chinese smartphone.Cons:-1.Camera interface is slow2. Takes about 2.45- 2.50 hrs to charge.3. Camera is worse in low light.Pros:-1. Big battery- big screen on time.2. Camera is awesome in daylight.3. Non-Chinese.Gaming is okay. I tried PUBG LITE & ASPHALT 9. I had no issues playing in balanced and hd settings.Overall Value for moneyüí∞.

"
"

  So far, so great. I can say that the battery life is insane! Can run for two days, no problem. Display is good. Fingerprint sensors are dodgy but overall, it's good product.

"
"

  Here is my review after 10 days:This is a good phone in this budget category bundled with features like sAmoled Screen, Massive Battery, Good Camera Quality, Simplified UI.On the negative side is its Face unlock which can be more better and faster.As I am a Normal User i.e. not a heavy gamer so it is working well for me and till now have not found any major flaws performance wise.

"
"

  The first look at display and it feels premium. The camera quality is good as well. The GUI takes time required learning curve though as I transitioned from Xiomi to Samsung. But it does give you Samsung brand feel. Face recognition at this price range is quite good and works really well. Battery lasts long. And I would recommend this phone as I have already used it for over a month now.

"
"

  Very poor vivo better than this

"
"

  Battery is shown as 6000 mah but it is draining so fast like it has 3000 mah battery. Mi phones are far better than these.

"
"

  So far so Good. Camera, battery life, picture quality, sound everything looks good. However the phone is heating up while charging. I think this has been problem with samsung for quite some time now. But apart from this heating issue, I think it serves me well.Thnks

"
"

  Review after 10 days of useBattery life is good. In full charge about 1.5 day you can use it.No hanging problem.Phone gets heat during charging but there is no heat issue during work on it.(I replaced my first phone bcoz there was a sound issue related to speaker.  Now in replaced phone speaker is in okay condition)

"
"

  Purchased samsung after long tym. loved the fone.camera quality is betrer than redmi ,realme, asus. I was using these phones from past few years..never had any complaints with them either but now when comparing with samsung i feel this fone is better...camera is the best....good battery life....fast charging n i loved the display....nyc gui....compared to redmi n all.....they feel like kids fones when it comes to gui

"
"

  Battery life is to goodCamera quality is mind blowingFinger print sensor is okSuper amoled display you are getting in this phone which provide you a better video watching experienceIf yo are looking for a allrounder phone bellow 14000 rupees then m21 is your destination

"
"

  Phone  is fab main top two is amazing  display and battery  , camera is good and speaker ok charging is ok , phone display  is top notch ,but creases  between  phone  and display lots of dust accumulates  , and mainly  I got refurbished  phone

"
"

  I bought this phone (4/64GB) on a price Rs12700/- although Samsung is selling this phone without discount at RS. 13999/-This is a budget phone. According to value, you can grab it. It's a Korean phone, as india has banned Chinese apps  and Indian citizens are looking non chinese mobiles. There are probably three options Samsung, apple and Nokia. I grabbed Samsung. I'm very happy.

"
"

  Camera is ok not snappy.Fingerprint magnet. Buy case and screen guard in advance.Battery is good.No bloatware.Remove animation and phone is super snappy.

"
"

  This device is OP. I found it to be very satisfying for the price I paid for a samsung device. It's battery capacity is really good.Pubg- (added advantage)smooth + extreme=40-50fps which is very good according to a normal gamer.(I don't play games,just reviewing it's gaming experience)A little more software optimization required...

"
"

  This phone is amazing.This is an outstanding phone at this price value.You all should not wait.Just grab it.It is lightweight and sleekAnd easy to handle.Good processor everything.makes me study online too easy. I love this phone. This is my one of the best buys from amazon. Thank you amazon and samnsung for making such an incredible phone available at such price value.

"
"

  Its Nice Budget Range Smartphone.The front camera is literally very good.In daylight condition the rear camera does its job like a pro.But in Night it struggle.Ui is also nice. Wide-angle clarity is worse. The it add orange tilt to the picture most of the times

"
"

  Nice phone under 15k. Best camera and battery life under 15k and everyone knows about thequality of camera of Samsung Devices. And pubg is also supported at 60 fps without any lag. Sensors are also working accurately. Nothing to worry you can definitely go for it. And Amazon delivery is also awesome always on time. And I am always happy and satisfied with services of Amazon. ThanksRegards,Abhishek

  Pros:-*Immersive experience for streaming  videos bcoz of sAmoled*Good battery backupCons:-*Build quality below average*Bad processor at this price*Fingerprint sensor is not good*Heating issue in normal uses even I didn't  play any games on this phone*Company should provide atleast normal  TPU case

"
"

  Display is not good fully yellowish camera is also not in fair quality but battery life and the branding of Samsung is good my buying experience is average with Samsung

"
"

  I purchased two sets of Samsung M21, for me and my wife, Fingerprint sensor is ok type,  Battery life is little bit disappointed, Camera quality is good.  Overall mobile is good in this price range, but faces some heating issue in one handset....

"
"

  After two weeks Iam writting this review.The phone is very good at this price 1399/-it looks average but perfomance is good,  this battery perfomance is good ones u charged it u can use it for 2 days. But the battery takes 2 hours for full charge. The camera and display screen is good at this price not superb. Finally at this price I satisfied the phone.

"
"

  to sum up my review in just a few words... "" best phone under 15000 rupees"" and it is a complete package.very good seller. no problem. new set running very nice. battery life is so good with 6000 mah.very good seller stpl

"
"

  Worst phon of samsung company.Worst battery performance:- samsung claims that this phin is equipped with 6000 mAh battery but its performance is like 3000mAh that too gets discharged very soonHeating problem:- even in a average use like 39 minutes , its get heat upwithout playing games. Slow charging:- This phon is 15W of fast charger but is takes more hours that of standard charger .

  A professional mobileAn all-rounderAbsolutely fantastic to purchase it from Samsung in this price6gb / 128gbSuperb performanceGood camera qualityBut Battery life is not like 6000 mahBut still it's good.

  The phone is just in 1 word its Awasum‚ù§Ô∏èüòçBt 1 week point is the front cam is not upto my mind satisfaction. Otherwise i should give 4.6/5 3% negetive for front cam . Really from my side i m truely speaking it jst a little monster‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòçüòç

  On 1st Jul'20, I have purchased Samsung M21 mobile, It got delivered to me on 11th Jul'20.Now after one month on 19th Aug'20, it has got problem. Screen is showing the mobile is charging but it is not starting.I have shown to Samsung service centre & it is under repair. We are not expecting such service from Samsung.I am totally disappoint with service from Samsung.

"
"

  The mobile is good, but the build quality doesn't seem to be up to the mark. It feels a bit fragile and must be used with a phone case of some sort. The camera is good, and so is the speed. The mobile doesn't lag.Overall worth it but invest in a good mobile case.

"
"

  Its a good phone at its price range, Samsung is a good brand, so it is obvious, it has got everything u wanted. Long battery life is impressive. The only problem Samsung could not dealt with till date is 'the phone can betray you in between urgent operations- it hangs alot' and too many adds while using different apps, even in between playing games- which is way irritating. Otherwise the phone is great.

"
"

  Awesome batterylife and camera quality, I think the M series lineup is better than the A series except for the additional features(useful to specific) and looks. I bought this phone for my dad and he is using it for a month, still no lags and gives a battery backup of more than two days, the ui is cleaner compared to the chinese brands in this range! It is best under 16K category! Above all it‚Äôs a non-chinese product ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  I don't know but I use m30 and 30s also which never ever got hang. But this mobile I gifted someone and they started using phone after 20 to 22 days of gifting and phone started hanging. I checked according to my settings but still same..

"
"

  I'm  writing this after one month of usage..and myphone  galaxy m21 6-128 .. is doing it's  job well ...no problem  faced yet...the  thing which i like very much is it's fhd+ super amoled  display.....i think charger should be around  30 watt so that the 6000 mah monster battery  charge much faster ..it has heating issues  when my network  single  is low... overall it is good ... üò¨üò¨

"
"

  Monstrous Battery at this price point. Battery just won't drain even  after full day usage.Superfast face unlock. Camera now comes with single take after the update. Super slow motion works brilliantly well. Bloatfree user inteface. The quality of display is mind bogglingly phenomenal. Just experience it. A complete packaged product from Samsung, manufactured proudly in India ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Too many Chinese apps preinstalled and there is no way to remove them. Also Samsung app keeps installing more and more apps for advertising and there is no way to stop that. Please do  not buy Samsung phones. Why these guys ship basic android and let users decide what to install ?

"
"

  The battery drains way to fast there is no use of having 6000 MAH battery just after 5 to 10 minutes of use the battery falls down to 7 to 8 % very bad quality and the Amazon  executive MRS. Swati was so rude in listeningto my query it seemed like she was not interested  in listening to my grievances she was just imposing her thoughts didint expect this kind of reponse from amazon i am very disappointed

"
"

  Can't connect galaxy m21 to my laptop via hotspot. Came to know from Samsung community that many Samsung phones are having the same issue. Felt pity that they have not tried to resolve the issue in forthcoming models. Will never recommend Samsung mobiles for connecting to internet via hotspot üëéüëéüëé

"
"

  Best product for millenials and best display as in used full day it gave me more than 8 hours of continuous usage including games and video movie and youtube music as well... all apps browising. I Tested rigorously.

"
"

  While purchasing , we thought Samsung will give a quality product , but within 2 months cell phone start giving problem . Instrument gets hang or get restart automatically. since yesterday we are facing problem with charging. Not worth buying . waste of money .

"
"

  Samsung M21 is great at this price. The biggest selling points are the Big Battery, AMOLED Screen, 4GB RAM and Samsung Exynos 9611 processor. Performance is Amazing, No Lags.The One UI offers great experienceOverall A Fantastic Phone!

"

  Fingerprint is not good quality.sometimes it work and sometimes it does not work properly.battery was good when i bought it.i bought it on the 13th july 2020.but after 3 months,charge of battery reduces speedly being 6000 mah battery.samsung should develop the quality of battery.company should provide higher watt adapter.it takes more than 2.5 hours to become fully charged.camera is good.üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí

"

  As this phone has 48megapixel camera is not at all seems like this yes but this has many options which gives better quality images and videos I have been using this phone from 1 month gud for gaming and multiple work on this phone at same time having 4GB 64gb variant and at the best price of 14k is fair enough with everything but if having much expectation so my recomend is go for upcoming m21s or m31s

  Pros. 1. Screen is best in class. Super amoled is just great for movies and pleasing to eyes.2. Battery backup is good3. Samsung one ui is very smooth and bug free4. Light weight.Cons.1. Charging time-though cannot complain much as 6000 mah need time to juice up2. Camera is on the average to good side not excellent3. No headphones included.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is a best budget oriented phone with amazing features and price as well and with good battery backup and camera quality is excellent and finger print sensor response is sharp. Happy with the Samsung M21.

"
"

  I am using Samsung M21, normal use battery drain out after 36 hour, and in description it shows 55hrs, and battery 6000 mah but it works like 5000 mah battery, heating problem if your are seeing video on internet more than 1 hour, I am putting review after using 15 days, finger sensor works fine but you can add only one finger, camera quality shows 48mp but not satisfaction on camera

"
"

  good product overall. battery good to last two days.game experience average, since I am not an avid gamer only time pass for a very short time.temple run 2 blokudoku. camera is also good in day time and average in evnings.call recording in built and without unnecessary ads.sound quality could have been better.  but hey ! paid only 15000/- bucks only , what do you want deepika !

"
"

  After using 2 monthsPros:1. Great display. 2.Good battery backup. 3. Front camera is awesome. 4.MS office and some Samsung apps are very useful.Cons:1. Processor could've been better considering it's competitors' ones at the same price range. 2. Cable ends are low quality plastic. Charging time is too long. 3. Rear camera isn't upto the mark. 4.Case is a must.

"
"

  The highlight of phone is 6000 mah battery that easily gives 2 days of backup and multitasking works great. Camera performance is up to the point as compared to the price of phone.Pubg runs smooth with descent setting options without any heating issues..I think m21 is the best option for under rs 15K with compared to other Chinese brands phones consisting bloatware and malicious apps.

  I love the screen resolution , camera clarity , office apps and more faculty in our budget That's why I will consider it as one of the most loveable best seller with a delicate screen , and storage with RAM .If somebody asks me about this phone I will strongly recommend theme to buy this phone at the earliest since it is the only one  mobile which proves our all facilities and budget too.Love the manufacturers.

"
"

  THE smartphone feels nice the cameras are also very good , it takes very sharp pictures . The speaker is very nice and lastly the screen or the display is fantastic the SAMOLED display really does the job. One gets the latest ONEUI CORE VERSION and lastly and android 10 operating system . The powerfull exynos 9611 does most of the tasks in a seamless manner. SO according to me M21 is worth every penny

"
"

  Very good product.  I am facing problems with internet and app sync. It take 15 sec to deliver a watsapp message while a  download in process. Internet is comparably slow .

"
"

  Crisp SuperAmoled display. Very long battery life. 15w fast charge doesn't seem slow(if u r changing from a old model).  CPU is fast. High graphics games works without lag. I'm not a heavy gamer(played Free fire and Asphalt). It works fine. No heating problem while gaming. Camera quality is fine. Face unlock works fine even in low light. Fingerprint sensor is fast.9/10 is my score among the mid budget phone.

"
"

  Trust me , don't buy this product . It has very much heating issues that I am not even able to hold it in my hand and its battery drains as much fast as a 4000mah battery,  I doesn't even feel like I am using a 6000 mah battery. It also hangs some times . I found  all these problems in just 2 days . I recommend you to buy realm 6i or poco m2 pro in this price range instead of buying this useless phone

"
"

  Have been using this phone for over couple of week now. This is truly a monster make.1. Long lasting battery2. Doesn't drain out easily3. Camera is very good and click very clear picture4. Camera give good results in night mode as well5. I have been running multiple app to test its performance and this has proven to be very good.6. Value for money

"
"

  I quite researched about this product and find this best under 15k1.Best Screen Quality2. Audio quality through speakers and headphone (Dolby Atmos) are just perfect.3. The battery is just awesome from full charging I got 18 hrs with moderate usage and AOD4. The camera quality is best in live focus and and the software of  main camera need improvement little bit5. And one UI minor freezes rarelyOverall -4.75/5üëç

  Excellent phone is the budget bracket and samsung is always trusted the the quality and security.

"
"

  Samsung has produced a very good phone. Its good in all respect. Not sure of gaming performance as i dont play much games. Its very smooth and fast. Happy with the purchase !!!

"
"

  Phone to catch 4G Network .. option of ""always"" is not provided. Only Auto chance option is given, so it changes to 3G anytime even if i am in a 4G network zone & i have to do Flight Mode ON & OFF & then i get 4G Network.Little Headache it is.Other all features are Nice n ok

"
"

  Purchased M21 with 6gb Ram and 128 GB storage. Speed is good.Touch is very goodDisplay and camera is very goodBattery life is very good.GUI Interface is excellent.Soud quality need to be improvedGo for it without thinking twice

"
"

  Good Phone for Daily use...Display quality is superb, battery backup is awesome, camara, UI, all r very great but I think Samsung must give a 25W charger .15W adapter is very slow for 6000mah massive battery to charge, it takes around two and a half hours to full charge.

"
"

  Best in-bugdet phone . I have been using REDMI NOTE 7 PRO since 1 yr , but it's performance was not so good in terms of battery-life and camera quality . I found my m21 model was better than my previous phone , in terms of battery life and also it's camera quality is pretty good .Overall it's the best in budget phone for the one who used to travel alot and needs best battery life experience and quality photos .

"
"

  Good mobile for daily use . good mobile under this range . Camera Quality is fine as expected from a mobile phone , Now If u want DSLR camera Quality , Go and spend 50000 and Purchase a DSLR , Good battery life , Better interface as compare to mi , oppo and other brand , Blue back with black edges works great

"
"

  Camera quality is worst. Nit satisfied with camera quality grunt back both the camera pic looks like fadded yellow shade and colors totally different sky blue looks like purple etc.Other features are good

"
"

  Processing of mobile is slow.and other negetive point is mobile having too much weight...not easy to carry ....overall i am giving only 2 star for this product ....internet speed is not so good ....Guys i personally recommended to you that not go for this mobile ....search another option ...

"
"

  After using phone for a month..I can say the phone is awesome..it works very well..the camera quality is absolutely amazing..the charging takes time..about 2 hrs..to charge fully..but after its charged it works for a long time.. fingerprint reader also works very well..I'm very satisfied with this model of Samsung.. impressed me a lot...At such low price..it gives quite a lot of features..I can surely say you to go for itüíØüëçüëç

"
"

  One of the wrist product .After I buying Samsung m21.14days later touch was not working I called amzon they said return time is completed .when i go Samsung customer care they said manufacturer mistake now to repair parted are not available and wait 15days for replace or coupons  this one wasting time of customers .So amzon pls take some action regarding this issue

"
"

  Received faulty phone finger print not properly fitted with back body and phone over heating while calling. And pickup guy asking to hand over phone without phone receiveing or acknowledgment. I refuse to return phone without receiving but amazone person arguing with me. now waiting for next pickup date. I want product replacement not refund. Rest phone is good

"
"

  Very good product in this price range.Camera quality is very good then expected.Battery life is very long. Almost 3 days after fully charge with all time internet ON.Front camera quality is too good. Night mode shot is also good.Very happy with the M21.Specially new feature give in update is AR ZONE. Very good app with latest camera filter.

"
"

  After using M21 i can assure each and everyone who wish to buy this phone that you will never feel disappointed.  Samsung Galaxy m21 is such a phone everyone will love it, not only because of its look but also its features. Camera clarity is superb with crystal  clear images. Totally, i couldn't  find any defects  with this phone and i am always proud for the decision i made to buy a Samsung phone..

"
"

  fingerprint reader is seems ok, battery  is 6000  MAH with fast charging,  not satisfactory as mobile takes more than 2.30 hours for full charge, hiwever it drains very fast. So forget about Long battery life, you have to charge daily your phone.  camera quality also not up to the mark like it's having 48 megapixel camera with scene optimizer,  it cannot focus properly while taking pictures specially text.

"
"

  Phone is really nice here are some points I want to tell1. Best battery backup 6000 mah2. Decent camera quality with ultra wide angle mode.3.light weight even with huge battery appreciable.4.some amazing features like long screenshot and one hand use can be activated simply and much more features5.no lag while playing PUBG in Ultra HD

"
"

  This is one of the best mobile phones in the price range. It gives amazing performance coupled with a heavy battery which will last upto 36 hours or so. The finger print reader is good but could have been better. I like the smoothness the mobile offers. The camera quality is really good and the new update is really good too. I like the display.One of the best buys. Go for it

"
"

  Awesome product by Samsung. I opted this bcoz of super amoled display which is rare in the athor brand of this price. Very clear and bright picture at night, and yes no red eyes at all which distinguish Samsung from the other. The device gets charged slow but lasts long. Feels sturdy. Using for three months yet no issue. Go for black it's more elegant than blue.

"
"

  I have given 4 stars so that they post my review.Within  2 months a purple smudge appeared on my display . Then I searched about it , and they say it happens when you drop the phone or put it in liquid , which i have never done this. and then the purple stain keep spreading through out my display. Now my display is completely damaged .Very disappointed.waste of money ,dont buy it.

"
"

  Good quality camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a good value for money and Highly Recommended than other Chinese phones :)

"
"

  Have been using since last one month. A good phone with decent camera, 6gigs of ram and massive battery to give you plenty of power enough for 2 days with moderate usage. No hanging problem. Body is solidly built. Go for it without going for those Chinese scrap.

"
"

  Good product in this range and well delivered. It has powerful battery, amoled screen, smooth touch, and high quality display for which Samsung is known for but camera quality can be improved further. I am not playing games so dont want to comment on it. I believe galaxy M series is far better than A  series. I recommend this if someone is looking a good phone in this price range

"
"

  This I my review after 1 monthPros1. Super Amoled Display ( Excellent )2. Huge Battery 6000 mah Backup up to 2 days (awesome)3.Camera Improved when compared to previous M series ( Nice)4.One U15.SOC Nice performance when compared to exynos 7906Corns1. Fast charging Better if Samsung will give 20 or 30 w fast charger

"
"

  After long time the Samsung launches a good mobile within budget  with awesome  camera and battery. I PLAYED  PUBG mobile atlest 6hour after 1 time charging. So it is good for gamer

"
"

  Battery capacity top . 10/10Display quality top . 10/10Performance quality top 10/10But camera focus & low light conditions need improvement . Plzzzzzzz

"
"

  I explain my personal experience about this Samsung galaxy M21.this is the worst product of Samsung .I use this phone only 2 months and suddenly one day phone is not working.i contact with my nearest services center and he told me your phone's mother board is totally die.and I noticed 5 same model phone has this type of problem so I doesn't suggest this mobile.please don't spend your money for this worst product.

"
"

  Pros-Very good battery life and awesome display.Battery will last for a whole day with heavy usage. Low SAR value makes the phone much safer than others.Cons-charging of phone takes nealy 3hrs. Because of low SAR value,wifi connectectivity from longer distance will be an issue.Strongly recommended for those need more battery life,very good display and low radiation level is the main priority as I am.

"
"

  Works very smooth, nice pics with the camera,charging fast even having 6000 MAH battery. In normal use battery works till 1.5 day/36  hrs. Experience of fingerprint reader, superb.Very nice product

"
"

  First of all in my review the best budget mobileMarvellous displayMonster batteryFast fingerprint sensor but not much fastProcessor is excellentCamera is decent üëçRear and front cameras are working greatNight mode is working greatBut takes a lot of time to chargeDisappointed as there is no case in the boxOverall a great product üëåüëå in this mid range

"
"

  I am writing this review after 1 month of use1.Monster battery with 6000mah can last upto 2 days after heavy usage2.Camera quality is superb having super colours3.Display is awesome full of different colors4. Fingerprint sensor is quite slow but not bad5. Sound is nice clear6. Lag free gaming booster feature goodOver all best in this segment at this price

"
"

  There is major problem in samsung m21 which i bought through Amazon . Pin pointed pink color appeared on the screen without any physical damage to the mobile, which is gradually incresing. The mobile is in under waranty period but the service centre is saying this type of disorder is not covered in the warranty and will have to pay for the repair. Very bad experience in online purchase of mobile.

"
"

  Phone is also surprisingly lightweight even though it packs in a whopping 6,000mAh battery. Colour accuracy of the M21‚Äôs screen is quite remarkable on the contrast levels also it happens to have Widevine L1 certification to watch streaming services‚Äô content in HD.

"
"

  Its my review after 1month previously i use one plus 5t for 2yrs unfortuntly my phone was broken and i choose this mobile .it battery backup not better compare to 1+5t eventhough this mobile have a 6000mah battery.  i never play  games or  any social media on my phone. In 1+5t charge time is max 1hr for full charge but this one i put 2hrs+ for full charge after that almound display good and performance is good .

"
"

  Samsung m21 is a very very most beautiful & Powerfull Smartphone.i loved it.Iam used number of mobiles But M21 is a Marvelous üß°.I will buy Another mobile to my Dad..My friends are will Redy to buy this.because they are attracted by M21. Ssssuuper battery life.. ssssuuper display..sssssuper processer.sssssuper stylish mobile.. ssssuper Comfort & sssuper smoothness. I loved it very much ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks to Amazon .this is a gift from Amazon to me ü•∞

"
"

  This phone is awsome in all aspects but lacks in ram management...when i checked average ram usage it was upto max of 3.2 gb i don't know that it should be like that only or not...but that's is the only problem...and leaving this issue everything is great about this phone...camera is great for photography enthusiast and gaming is average...you get 50-55 fps on smooth and extreme settings...loved thia product samsung...‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Everything about this phone is excellant.I have been using it for a week. The camera quality is good. The battery life is over 24 hours.The touch screen is responsive.There is no bloatware, only required apps come re installed

"
"

  Pathetic phone. Recieved a faulty phone. Had to visit Samsung service centre. Phone was not replaced by them but they repaired. Spending 16k and using a repaired phone. Was not expected from brand like Samsung. The charm of using a new phone is lost. Wake up Samsung please focus on quality don't take advantage of boycott chinese brands and dump inferior products to us. Shame !!

"
"

  Product is good...Camera quality is good...Battery wise - My mobile data will be always on during day time...If I charge 100% it will withstand for 1 and half days till it reach 15%.Only issue i am facing is that rarely phone gets restart automatically....

"
"

  Using it since 2 days.Initial comments:- excellent battery life (lasts 2 full days)- excellent camera- excellent display due to Super AMOLED screenCouple of issues: little bit heating during phone charging, audio output should have been bit louder

"
"

  I have bought Samsung galaxy M 21 two months ago..now the device has started creating problem like charging issue, phone gets hang, phone is working slowly. Samsung stores are shut in my place. So what's the procedure to get my phone's problem resolved.Do not buy the mobile phone from Amazon , they are not helpful.Very disappointed,Will never buy any products from this website.

"
"

  Galaxy M21 is a reasonable phone for its price. My primary objective was the camera's quality. And of course, I was let down as soon as I began to take pictures. Its features are decent and don't believe the hype, it's not up to it. Maybe I was expecting way too much, that was the problem. All I can say is this. If you would go for it with certain expectations, chances are you'd be dissatisfied.

"
"

  Highly disappointed with front camera quality..my old samsung m30s phone with 16 megapixel camera gives better selfie than 20 megapixel camera of this samsung m21..very bad phone not has the quality of other samsung phone..they r not exchanging or replacing also

"
"

  I don't recommend. Only battery is the advantages. Camera is also average.Now a days screen shot is most essential part a mobile,but it is not easy like other mobiles, better to buy redmi,Vivo or oppo .

"
"

  Full Charging time 15 hour

"
"

  This Phone(Samsung M21) is Amazing. I'm using this for one n half month now I can clearly say that M21 is real Monster coz  earlier I had purchased Samsung M30s for my mom which is quite good but in price range M21 is winner coz it has Monster Battery, decent camera and a super amoled display in super budget price, I'm totally wondered with this Samsung M21.

"
"

  In a single sentence,  Samsung M21 is a extremely good product, who can meet our needs from a quality smartphone. Super value of money.  My son is a student of mass com  he make some small professional VDO and edit with this phone  which are highly appreciated by viewers from youtube.I strongly recommend to go for SAMSUNG M21, it will definitely fulfill your needs.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader battery life camera all three are very satisfying things in which the mobile have. But one thing I want to mention charging speed is little slow bcs 6000mah battery is present so extra fast speed charging charger will be fabricated by campany in future smart phones üòö

"
"

  Battery drains fast irrespective of 6000mah.Pls don't buy as the main problem with this phone M21 is too slow and gets hanged. Surprising is that even a phone takes min 15~20 seconds to restore after the call gets disconnected.

"
"

  Mob is good but the problem is it hits up while charging also strt heating when u use it for a long time.. battery is of 6000mh but battery life is not that much gud...camera is very gud and display is excellent!! Overally its ok ok type redmi and realme are btr than this

"
"

  Heating problem.. within in few seconds on switching the camera, the phone gets heated. Not really a good mobile for a long time use ... I didnt expect this from Samsung makers . Even after replacement I got the mobile with same problem, so all the Samsung Galaxy m21 model have the same problem ..

"
"

  Value for Money üí∞Pros:*Amazing Camera Quality*Mind boggling Display with AMOLED. Smartphones with AMOLED display in this price range is very rare*Smooth Experience especially One UI 2.0*Dolby Atmos*Awesome Video Recording with stabilizationCons:-*Battery Backup is Just okay*Little bit heating*Feels thicker and little bit weighty*Outdated design

"
"

  I like the battery back up as well as the display of the smartphone , no other company is offering you FHD+ sAmoled panel in this price range , also the cameras are good enough to capture brighter and punchier images , overall a decent package from samsung.GOOD JOB SAMSUNG....!!!

"
"

  The phone performance is excellent.  Camera and sound quality is tremendous.  Fingerprint sensor is also nice. All app in the phone is running smoothly. The voice of calling and receivig is excellent and clear.Finally, the performance of the mobile set is tremandous and it is nice to purchase on that rate.Thanks

"
"

  I had purchased this phone for my mother and within 15 days , it stopped responding. Screen has gone and not able to do anything. Cant expect such thing from Samsung when we trust our Made In India concept and place the order. Please dont buy this phone and waste your money.  I am Struggling to fix this phone issue .

"
"

  First of all thanks to Amazon for original products delivery our bonding is so strong now and if you look this smartphone is one of the most budget friendly phone with all the features with a big battery life. I personally use this phone for 2 months now amazing phone not a single problem occur in it superb performance no lacking issues ,camera quality is at it's best. Without any doubt go and purchase this samsung m21

"
"

  The overall quality of the phone is awesome. The camera is performance is great, battery is long lasting, screen quality is best in the segment. But there are some areas where it lags behind that first of all case should be included in the box, charging  cord way too small.I would say a the phone is bit overpriced as compared to other  phones in the segment.But Samsung's  has improved  a lot.

"
"

  Best budget buy.After thorough search n analysis I just wanted to go with m21. In fact its display is the most common factor which attracted me to bought this. Best buy in this budget category. Battery life is some what below the expectations. Camera performance is good grt colors.... only drawback I noticed is its singal reception not uptown the mark.... finally I suggest u that it gives u gd experience. Go for it

"
"

  This phone is awesome in this price segment i got in ‚Çπ12699 that's very good price it have nic display and huge battery it is really monster and processor is also good o bought this phone for my dad he like Samsung phone this was the perfect option that's why i decide to buy this phone , you can go for it ...

"
"

  Not satisfied  yesterday my mobile were fell down and display not came.. it's got repair.. Its just I bought two weeks before only.. it's not for worth of money, now I think  how can I change thisBut overall specifications of the mobile phone is good.

"
"

  Its average best phone in overall specifications.Pros :* Battery backup is well.* Display is very clear and smooth.* Camera is not very bad. Average clearity cameras.* Sound quality is better.Con's :* its Not working like 6 GB ram. Poor performance of Processor. Some times hanging.* 4g /volte /Network connect properly due to hanging.*

"
"

  I got my samsung M21 on 8 August 2020 yesterday my phone stopped working.when I contacted to service center they said that the set is damaged from inside.how can a mobile phone get damaged from inside without getting screen broken or even without a single sctrach.i have attached a photo of my phone..they have provided me a damage phone..and the service center also not giving appropriate answer

"
"

  The device started acting up within 5 days of delivery.When requested for a return, we were directed to the Amazon Tech team who in return suggested an app to be installed.Post app installation, it worked fine for another week and the touch screen is not working now!Apparently the app ensured that the device works until return window expires!!Ridiculously sad experience

"
"

  Samsung M21 is exactly a monster among the mid-range  mobile phones. First of all this device is not for heavy gamers as you can only enjoy Pes Football kinda games in an average level but for UI and UX and Display and Camera (in Daylight) you won't get a better product in this price. There are a number of cons but if you consider that,  you can add a little more to the budget and can get better devices than M21.

"
"

  So this phone has a major issue you are going to face . this phone has a screen flickering issue after 10 days of usuage. Now I'm in a situation where I cannot replace and have to visit the service centre where your phones lcd panel and a few softwares will be uploaded. As per the covid situation it would take a long time to get it fixed. If you are ready for all this go for this. Many people have faced this issue.

"
"

  The worst decision I ever made purchasing this model.When I get a call the screen is blank I don't know who is calling me.And can't hear from.both sides.The worst phone of samsung.I purchased this on Aug 7th-20 and the service center lady told I am not eligible for. Replacement. Waste of money.

"
"

  Using Samsung product after 5 years again, must say not disappointed as of now, reviews after usage of few months,1. Screen view quality is good2. Audio quality is good3. Not much of a camera person, but still I feel it's good

"
"

  Likes:-#Non Chinese Brand and make in India.1.full hd AMOLED display2.6000 mah masive battery3.tripple camera setup4.Weight management5.fast charging.Dislike:-1.build quality2.night ligh camera is not so clear3.some time fingerprint scanner not response in starting few touches4.not crystal clear images.5. slow fingerprint scanner.

"

  Here is my review of using 5daysI like the smooth edges of phoneüòäThe battery giving its best powerüëåFingerprints sensor is a litlle bit slow but the accuracy is good üëÜandThe cam quality doesn't reach expectation of 48mp qualityand also have few noiceü§èLast but not least the performance is the best at this budgetüëèüëçüëå

"
"

  The Samsung M21 is too good. First of all its look cool. The UI is very siMple. The AR systems in this phone is preety cool. Like performance of bettery life, camera, and super fast fingerprint sensor. I like samsung. In my side the price range is totally fair. Lucky to have a samsung member.

"
"

  The battery backup, back & selfie cam's, the super Amoled screen,  the screen size, biometric security, software updates and many more flooded features are super fabulous. I strongly recommend this mobile.

"
"

  I have purchased it last month and within 15days its screen got blank and hanged after this I have visted samsung service center they were given me 10 days time but since now they are also blank on their side.... So it's my personal advice to all them who are going to purchase samsung phone due to patriotic reason pls don't be foolish... You guys definitely going to face lot

"
"

  It has been almost one week that I am using Samsung M21 as my primary device. The battery backup is good. For normal use one and half days will be covered with one recharge. It takes 2 hours to recharge fully.Features are good and user friendly. Wonderful screen. Nice experience while watching multimedia.Overall nice Budget phone. Recommend to buy....

"
"

  The phone was soaking wet when delivered to me.  The cardboard was melted due to water damage.  Even the phone was little wet to

"
"

  Purchased this for my dad as he dont want too constantly charge his phone but still use for all day and consume media in high quality. AND THIS DOES IT ALL! One of the best android you can pick at this price point! Lived this one.A quick tip: buy back cover before the phone arrives it is prone to scratches and feels like will break in one impact.

"
"

  Love it In 13999Great battery which is really monster after charging 100% it will stand up with me almost 3 days as a moderate user. Software quality is too good, camera is much improved than others. Build quality is much solid.That's why I am trust Samsung.

"
"

  Superb battery life around 1 and half day, camera quality is awesome, really good product..

"
"

  I am much  thankful  to  Amazon ü§ùü§ùü§ù for  the ""SAMSUNG  GALAXY  M21""The amazing features , best design quality , best features,best performance, best resolution, best battery backup ,best multitasking ,good for  playing  pubg , freefire ,battleground,call of  duty  for long  time  without  any  heating or lags,best for rough  and tough daily usable phone.

"
"

  I think I got an already defevtive piece.It was not even 1 month since I bought it and my phone started to hang.And from then it's performance has become very poor. Per day, it hangs and switches off by itself atleast for 2 times, and some times, even more.This is one of the most disgusting experience a user could ld ever get.Battery life is good.Camera is fine.

"
"

  I could only find 2 cons in this mobile1. The fingerprint reader can't always read my finger. To be fair this might be because I live in a city with humid weather.2. The heating issue, the phone gets really hot sometimes. Specifically during charging, or when installing a system update.Everything else from battery life to camera quality to UI to smoothness is awesome.

"
"

  The mobile was a gift for my Mother. She was using an old Samsung my sis had gifted. So naturally went for Samsung to avoid complication for her usage. Being not so careful person - as age related trouble are there, she never wanted to spend on flagship models and spend money.  In this model - we got all required - and she'e quite happy with the display and camera features.

"
"

  Lives to it's title.... Best in all segments... Vfm... U can purchase it cause for the cost it is offered it bang and more for it's buck... Got it delivered before time. Don't think jus buy it.... Excellent phone in the said budget... üëç

"

  This mob I purchased 2 weeks before for my mom stil I can't use  , it's not working properly ( automatically flight mode is on and off ,this mob is given to Samsung service center Kodunallur and they can't fix .. what will do next.. now they are saying mother board need to changeI am not happy this product..

"

  Best mobile under this budget it as 6000amh battery it gives full day battery fullhd+amoled display it helps to see movies in hd1080p on Amazon prime videos and its sound quality is better because it has dolby atmos and go for it

"
"

  I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER USING M21 FOR ALMOST 1 MONTH AND I WILL GIVE 5* TO THIS PHONE SPECIALLY FOR BATTERY.IT IS VERY GOOD MID SEGMENT PHONEPRO1.VERY NICE BATTERY BACKUP2.VERY GOOD CAMERA3.VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE OVERALL4.FULL CHARGED IN ALMOST 45 MINCONS1.FINGER PRINT COULD BE BETTER2.AT THE TIME OF CHARGING IF YOU RECEIVE SOME MESSAGE SCREEN REMAINS ON

"
"

  Great product but got disappointed because they haven't gave mobile cover neither screen guard. At least they should give screen guard. Also charger included was Samsung's basic travel adapter which didn't stand against 6000mah giant battery.Display was out standingBattery was amazingCamera performance great.

"
"

  Been using this phone for about 3months know and I absolutely love it! It's got a good camera, a massive battery that lasts an entire day even with me being on social media and CoD all day instead of studying for my semester exams. Would definitely recommend this to you if you want a budget phone and you don't like charging your phone often.

"
"

  In the budget of Rs 16000, this is an amazing  phone. Very smooth in operation. It has got good camera, long battery  life and smooth feel. Anyone who is looking for a phone for routine  use to access internet, use camera and to have nice experience of having trouble free mobile phone, this is the choice. I have used Nokia, Asus and Redmi phone and as per my verdict,  this is the best phone in this budget.

"
"

  third class product when you zoom the pics that you click there is no detail in the picture.6000mah battery but it decay in only 24 hrs my last phone MI A3 which has 4000mah and it is used to run uptown 20 hrs.fingerprint sensor is worst every time it popup a message that fingerprint sensor is cancelled.don't buy this phone invest 2500 extra and go for M31 or else

"
"

  One of the best, made in India phone. All features are good,  clear display, picture quality awesome, ofcourse you need a good internet connection.  Still more to explore...

"
"

  Review after 24 hour.overall the phone is good.but the camera is not good.and also you will get only phone,charger,user manual,and eject pin with this.battey will last only 24 hours.

"
"

  Our phone started having a set of  pink dot near the side power button on the screen , this is just less than a month from the date of purchase , bought this based on good reviews , now we are having tough time repairing this , as the service person is telling this is not covered under warranty and needs a replacement of screen , 5000 INR . Anyone having similar issues? , how you resolved.

"

  Best Samsung Phone at this rateGalaxy  M21 is a another blockbuster mobile phone by Samsung.As no one offers us 6000 mah battery it is the first important feature of this mobile phone.Also it's look very good at this price and very nice phone to  buy.It very smooth to use and handle.Camera can be improved but very good at this price.All over 9/10 points by me.  Thanks a lot ""Amazon"" & ""Samsung""

"
"

  As per my experience the fingerprint reader is highly sensible . Huge Battery life of the phone is long lasting. I used it for 12 hours regularly to see the videos and 50 % battery was consumd. As far as concern to camera quality it gives high resolution images with the best quality and has a lot of functions. This phone has attractive display and wonderful features .I recommend this phone for everyone.

"
"

  Please don't buy i have been scamed.Very bad product cheap quality dont buy no customer service i have buy on 4th sep 2020 and whithin 10 days only phone gone a blank its self  and no function at all, and service centre excecutive  said its out of warrenty no support even amazon also didn't support me. i have never ever seen such suck  serivces like that.

"
"

  I am writing drawbacks of this phone... as advantages are already mentioned in the product description. I have just purchased 15 days back.1. Battery charging very slow.2. Mobile heats lot without any reason... no matter whether it is charging or using or browsing.3. If battery doesn't perform good, mobile performance can't be said good.

  1. Screen Quality - 10/102. Camara Quality - 7/10 (becoz not focus immediately also in video and slow mo video quality in not good)3. Battery -5/10 (after 3-4 days not feel 6000mah battery life)4. Charging time almost 2.45 hours but at charging a little bit heating5. Very Good Icon6. Dark mode, focus mode ,blue light filter ,AODs superbOther Things in m21 very good

"
"

  Within 14k price range it's a good smart phone . Am giving this review after using it for 1 month . Camera quality is good and processer is also okay at this range . But there is some issue sometimes with lock screen , sometimes without asking for password phone get unlock with just sliding up . And for 6000 battery life it work less may be . But phone is fast no hang problems so far .

"
"

  The phone Samsung M21 not even compared with any other 10000 rupees phone it does not have sufficient management system and hangs a lot and the processor is very weak it is only for ladies and watching movies and not for everyone

"
"

  Charge 100% and I challenge you to drain the battery fully withing 8 hours , its has  monster marathon batterylife .. You can charge your phone and dont worry for 2-3 days , if you play games then it ready to rumble for the whole day.. Processor is not that ultra smooth for pubg , camera quality is good and better for making slow and super slow motion videos... Pretty awesome piece at affordable price ..

"

  Camera quality is goodDisplay awesomeBattery life awesomeNetwork connectivity good (with dual volte support)User interface awesomeOverall performance for normal uses awesomeGaming experience not badLight weightSound quality is good but not loud üîäCharging speed slow (It can take aprox 2.5 hrs to full charge)

"
"

  overall is good but day by day battery life reduces that is day by day battery down faster and also when connect charger to phone some amount of heating issue is theredont update phone is my advisecamera is goodno hanging problembuild quality is quite oksmall scratch come quickly on back panelfingerprint are quite good

"
"

  Every thing in this smartphone is just very good and people says the processor is not good but guys trust me its very decent for this price, you must have to buy this phone in 14000. Fingerprint sensor is very fast and talking about battery its massive from 6000 mah it last long for 3-4 days and talking about camera quality cameras are very good but the pictures are just beat oversaturatedThank you!!!

"
"

  ¬†overall  product is good and 100% genuine ,mobile is really fast and smoothbut camera quality is not that good as specially  at nightbut yes  i am  facing problem  with speaker when it is in loudspeaker at  full capacity it feel like sound is brustingotherwise overall product is good just camera and speaker must improve

"
"

  Awesome phone .Display is super.  super amoled display is one of the great in smartphone display segment reallybetterthan ips display.Speaker quality is very good.Camera quality is super.Performance is excellent...Really good choice.Best in this price range..I trust  Samsung because I'm using Samsung tab2 for 8 year without any complaint.

"
"

  Best phone by samsung at this price rangePros:-1) Big Monster Battery2) Amazing Camera3) Best Amoled Screen in market4) Such Premium Looks and Finish5) Charging is Super fast. Good for busy people.Cons:-1) Not a con but it is premium quality case not for messy rough use.Use you phone with love and care it is amazing at this Price.

"
"

  Writing this review after 2 months of use, this is really a monster phone. Camera quality may disappoint for indoor shooting and photography. Battery life is awesome, you can binge watch any webseries and still it will work for next day. Dolby is provided but I am not too impressed with that because earlier I was using lenovo which had awesome sound quality .Nice phone you can buy in this budget

"
"

  Using for almost 7 days now. This is good phone. Battery is super for me lasts1.5 dayOr more with 4 to 6 hrs usage per day approx.Only delay was delivery time was 8 to 9 days after purchase.Camera is better and meeting expectations for me.Also I got 6 GB and 128 GB device, looks fantastic.

"
"

  The mobile is very awesome üëå and very shiny .I have taken raven black its looking very classy .The screen is very soft and touch is very smooth .The cam is very clarity 48 quad cam and 20mp front cam .the quality is very good and reasonable price for this mobile.

"
"

  If you are not game player then,It's a dynamite.Lots of features going your mind blast to see this in Samsung.Thanks Samsung,thanks seller, and thanks to amazon for such great fast delivery in 3 days only.,üòò

"
"

  The phone is good in  every aspect  for a normal user...Camera ,battery life  facilities all are good. But never use it witjout screen protector.The screen broke when it fall from hand only from a height of half feet.The platic back will not give you that much satisfaction as you  hope looking pictures from the internet.The gorilla glass 3 protection is valuess .It does not protect at all..

"
"

  Its been more than a month and I haven't found any issues yet. The battery takes less than 3 hours to charge(I mean its 6000 mAH! we are talking about), and works all day long (when using like hardcore 7-8 hours). Camera quality is just fine. RAM and processor works perfect. One UI and android 10 looks lit. It is also getting android 11 update soon. A product worth buying at this price.

"
"

  For the price, this phone is definately worth it.Well built.Good camera.AMOLED screen is really vibrant.First time owning a Samsung phone and so far it's been good.One drawback that I could think of is that the back is really smooth and little slippery.  But putting a protective cover can mitigate this.

"
"

  Amazing phone. What a display. What a camera uwaaaavvvv. But in playstore you may see the issue waiting for download. It is not an issue background downloading is interrupt. So you stop the auto download. Enjoy the phone.Panorama, very small size picture only clicked is that or any app settings.

"
"

  Awesome handset with all the features you need. Battery is enough to use this mobile with video or call or music.. go 4 it...üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç Thank you Samsung.But the delivery time is irritating from Amazon. It took 6-7 days to shipped the product. Please rectify this problem.

"
"

  like the battery.. it last more than 24hrs.. in video, talking, music and reading on the phone... charging is very fast within half hour.. 100% charged.. nice phone

"
"

  Best smartphone üì± in this rangeFingerprint sensor is smooth and fast working.Camera is also nice,Battery backup is totally outstanding.OS with Android 10.0 also niceI love this phone.....Highly Recommended phone mid range priceAll way totally outstanding performances of this phone every new smartphone buyer must have to check one time this phone...

"
"

  Best phone under this price rangePros:1. long battery life2.super amoeld display with sharp colours3.comes with android 10 have Advanced function which make mobile easier to use4.camera quallity is awesome5.camera with super steady and slow motion optionBest mobile for the price range of 14000Cons:-1.Sometimes net speed is slow and network problem

"
"

  Just bought yesterday handset is good but no back cover plus box looks as if the seller made at his house . Packing hopeless , Only Gods grace the charger and the pin was there

"
"

  It's a very good phone but for everyday user. It's great to watch videos in the amoled screen. The camera quality is good but sometimes the colours came out very punchy which is annoying ( thinks Samsung should put an update about this). But if you are s pubg lover just ignore the whole samsung M series. But for a normal user it's an affordable buy in this price segment.

"
"

  Let me give true feedback of this product.Pros1. Good performance2. Good picture  quality3. Touch and fingerprint  are fast and goodCons.1. Taking  almost 4+ hours in charging2. Don't  expect much from camera3. Sound volume is very low in speakers and wireless headphones

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is one the best smartphone of the year 2020. In terms of battery,  camera, user interface, spec's is all best. But despite 6000 mAh battery it is being drained throughout the day perhaps background apps must be heavily consuming battery,  need for fixing this issue.

"
"

  Right after we buy exactly on the day 8, the phone totally  stopped working, touch never worked.. hanged ..  no use from Amazon or seller.. no.refund replacement yet!! Also they recommended  to.give it in samsung service  store.. and the phone who bought the phone..  has to.relay on someone to get it done.. hopeless product and seller..!

"
"

  The phone is great. But not a premium feeling. I love the ui. Camera quality is decent. Picture quality decrease when zooming. Processor is great. Everything is running smoothly. But it does not include any music player.whatsapp is not installed. Back design is not so good. I love the screen. It's super smooth. Battery backup is very good. But charging speed is slow. Great job samsung.

"
"

  I totally dislike the word 'dislike', as far as my Samsung mobile  is concerned. Amazing camera quality, highly useful finger print reader and unimaginable battery life. I am blessed with this mobile.

"
"

  Everything in this smartphone is good. It is my first time buying a Samsung Phone after all. It's good and all but there are some restrictions in this phone also, like you can't access the full system specification on any third party apps. If you want a phone that can give you 10+ hour screen time usage then buy this. Also the Amoled display is good too but not HDR10 supported. You can play it though but can't tell the difference.

"
"

  I liked the product so much, as a photographer it has a good camera so far with auto HDR and within camera stability is also very awesome for videography.Super Amoled display works best in this phone for movie lovers as it gives best colours to our eyes.30 hours of battery time on a heavy usage of netflix and social media, with 6000 mAh battery.Overall the best budget phone is galaxy M21

"
"

  Delivered within 2 daysTouchpad is not workingRequested for tech visit amazon took 2 days to send tech to review the issueThen tool another 4 days to deliver it to me. Next is box is onthe way and will be delivered on 9th Sep 2020.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is really a monster in terms of camara , Battery and its build quality .best budget mobile phone under 15000 segment. Aesthetic appearance is awesome.Both front and back camera are superb.Battery is excellent.Display quality is Amazing.Overall perfomance is best.I recommended this mobile phone to new buyers.Thank you samsung for giving this product.

"
"

  I've waited a month before writing this review. For the price range, this is a pretty decent phone. Suggest you go for M31 if you're looking for better Ram/Slightly better camera quality.The only thing that bugs me about the phone is the fingerprint reader. It is a pain to work with, you'll be better off using the face recognition / pattern to unlock your phone.

"
"

  What a invention."" Beauty and the beast"" combonation with super amoled display with monster battery life. Value for money product.

"
"

  This phone meets all the expectations  in terms of quality,  Samung has lived up it reputation  by giving  this phone in this range..1.Mamoth battery life.2.Best Quality display..3.Sound is also good..4.Camera quality  is also best in this range..Go for it value for money..

"
"

  Firstly i should tell display which is very good for eyes because of samolededEvery thing is to much fast as compare samsung m20 like app installation or opening of any applicationAll process is very fastAlso huge battery good for gaming or any things

"
"

  Definitely best budget phone under 15000 price range. Monsterous Battery which long lasts approximately for 2 days. You cannot ask for a more better camera in the given price range. It's just awesome. Bought it for my Dad‚ù§Ô∏èHe just loved using the Galaxy M21. Honest review after using it around a week now.A Big YES is you are planning to buy a new budget segment smartphone.

"
"

  Samsung lacks many features that other phones have, especially MI phones.hopeless fingerprint sensor.. No notification light.. Notes app has no dark mode..

"
"

  i bought this phone a month ago for 14kprodisplay quality is goodcamera is goodone UI is smoothcons6000mah battery does not perform like it should be it does not give me good backup even i do not play any gamescharging speed is slow (15W)blotware is there in phone some banned apps were there like HELO app.

"
"

  Words are not enough to praise the quality of SAMSUNG products. I am completely satisfied with Galaxy m21. I am more happy with the Dolby Atmos feature. I think the persons who loves music must have this mobile. The mobile is priceworthy with this features and didn't expected a mobile with top class quality from Samsung in this budget. Love you Samsung.

"
"

  I have attached 2front camera picture and one rear picture with full zoom and normal mode one also.You can differentiate how the poor quality of samsung m21 camera.I can't return my phone due to some issues otherwise I have return it.Don't ever buy it as I also taken review to my colleagues also who recently bought it.

"
"

  A great and superb phone for mid range price pointAmazing cameras build quality and performanceAlmost outperform most of its Chinese mobile phone brand competitorA must buy and i highly recommend this phone for budget users who is look a great phone in this price range

"
"

  Charger is not workingI charged the mobile for only once and Amazon app is not allowing me return or exchange this. Had bad experience on buying iPhone SE even then bought the same through Amazon. Vendors here are really suckers.

"
"

  Detective but not taken return

"
"

  I am writing this review after using Samsung m21 for 5 days...this mobile is amazing camera clearity, battery life and display quality is excellent...but may be there is sim network issue some time it shows full and suddenly only one or two lines don‚Äôt know that is related to service providers or mobile issue...

"
"

  Cons:1.For All third party app asking all permission that's drawback.2.Taking more time for charging . 3hrs required for full charge.3.No app lock inbuilt.Pros:1. Good display viewing2. Nice feeling to use3.good battery backup.

"
"

  It's fingerprint reader is very good battery life is also good but camera quality is very excellent we should appreciate and tell Amazon please make me a Amazon prime

"
"

  Best product  product Samsung m 21 . I purchased  29 july and best product.  Its very long battery  life . I charged  tomorrow  then today evening  have left 51 percent . I used phone very good products.  Best phone m 21 . Its excellent camera and touch awesome.  And display  is very best for viewing movies amazing entertain for movie because  original colour view full hd  and fast internet  connectivity

"
"

  I bought Samsung Galaxy M21 Raven Black and happy with the purchase as I found it to be a reliable smartphone within budget. All the specs like UI, Camera, Battery Life, Processor are Excellent. Call quality is also excellent with this phone. The phone is packed with good features and observed no lags while multitasking. Thank You Samsung for a good product and Amazon for delivering the product on time.

"
"

  One of the best smartphones till date in this price range. Battery life is awesome and so is the camera quality. I am writing this review after using this smartphone for 1 month. No problem with the phone.

"
"

  It really a worst experience with Amazon, I faced an issue with this mobile with network connectivity during the first order it will automatically get disconnected for each 5 mins,  I replaced it with a new mobile and just now it got delivered and found a damage in the mobile with a buldge in the back panel near the finger print sensor

"
"

  The CAMERA ,BATTERY AND DISPLAY IS THE BEST THING IN THIS PHONE AND IN THIS PRICE .IF YOU ARE A DAILY USER BUT NOT INTERESTED IN GAME , I SUGGEST YOU ABSOLUTELY GO FOR THIS DEVICE BECAUSE THIS DEVICE .A LITTLE ISSUE IN THIS PHONE IS IT HEATS QUICKLY IN IF YOU ARE LIVING IN COLD TEMPERATURE AREA THIS SHOULD BE A BEST OPTION FOR YOU .THANKS . YOUR TRULY ,GAURAV.

"
"

  A very good phone with an extended battery life which is good for a day and half with moderate use. The camera is superb too. The only advice is to not take the Raven Black Model due its heating issues while charging or running tech heavy games or applications.  Its a basic budget phone which ticks all the boxes, so don't even think of complaining.

"
"

  This is an amazing phone... if you need some highly powerful in terms of gaming, battery life as well as camera you undoubtedly can go through this product... I am reviewing this after 10 day of use and believe me.. it is truly a monster.. fingerprint sensor,  face unlock are doing great job... and the camera is just class apart.and the battery is so powerful that a whole day pubg will run only 50% of it ... it's just amazing

"
"

  Please Understand : You don't have any Indian alternative for now and this is one of the best chinese phones alternetive you have. So, spend some more and go for it.It's best in class product.

"
"

  A nice phone from Samsung with nice budget ... I'm happy. First I was an mi user I shifted to Samsung coz tht was an Chinese product.The thing is I did not get music app in this new Samsung phone and also I'm not finding status of my daily data usage. Only these two features are not there. I request Samsung to update this as soon as possible üôÇ

  It's a nice phone in this budget the camera is very nice n I m really thankful to Amazon for such a good service my previous phone was having a heating problem so I claimed a replacement n I got the replacement this phone is working really nice this also heats but normal heatness so overall it's a good phone

"
"

  Too worse experience. Battery won't stand for a very minimal usage. Mobile restarts automatically on its own Don't know what to do. In past 2 months from the time I bought formatted the mobile multiple times.Very bad experience, I say no . I am using realme for a while now no complaints at all...

"
"

  It is really ""smooth""experience with Samsung M21. Camera is very good.I have not reviewed finger print reader as I am a physician and using gloves all the time hence not activated this. Storage is gr8. Only thing I want is that whenever phone is locked it does not show missed call, one has to go to calls to see if there is missed call

"
"

  Its been 4 days since i am using this.The best thing about phone is its battery life however fast charging is not as expected.The phone is beautifully designed and seems to be build strong.Camera quality is better than expected so plus points for it.Overall, i am happy to make samsung m21 as my new device

"
"

  Great displaySmooth usageLiked the colour of midnight blueFingerprint reader very fast and sensitiveSlight heating up issueBattery life ok but not like 6000mah takes 2hrs 45mins to full charge..Camera quality ok ok typeEarphone output good dolby atmos but its mic is not recording any sound, while calling other person can not hear anything..Overall best phone for media consumption

"
"

  Samsung should give Qualcomm instead of Exynos. If you want to increase sell of your own processor than at least give higher version of Exynos. I wanted to buy note 10+ but i didn't only because of Exynos. why are you not giving option of Qualcomm to Indian consumers also? This might be the only reason public preferres iphone more than samsung for premium products.

"
"

  I purchased this monster smartphone around 2 months ago and I have really loved it. When it was launched I thought of buying it but had some doubts that if Xiaomi or other phones are better but considering the fact that they are Chinese and this is not I bought it and I am seriously happy that I didn‚Äôt buy the Chinese and instead I bought this. I love everything of this phone and it‚Äôs every featureüòçüòä

"
"

  I would suggest not to buy this product because within 15 days of its purchase the display got cracked because of heating. The service center people are worst in servicing the customers... even the crack is because of heating the samsung not accepting their mistake... Dont buy this product...worst product....battery life is only for 8 hrs....without gaming, camer quality is ok only

"
"

  Really a very good Product according to the price it had launched. I am Satisfied with the Smartphone M21. But i feel a little bit heating on the upper side of the phone while playing games like PUBG or even Temple running. Overally For the entertainment purpose this is really a good device to go for at the price segment of below 15000.

"
"

  Very good phone. Value for money.This phone is excellent in terms of performance, having 6gb ram and 128 GB internal storage and Amoled display, it becomes monster.Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing.Gaming performance is also good and if talk about battery it is having 6000 mah and it seems good so far. Camera is also nice.

"
"

  The sim holder is not properly fitted. When we call to other a person they cant hear audio.Do not buy online rather than go offline stores. at least they will entertain you and resolved problems.

"
"

  I am super lucky to have purchased this phone for Rs 12699 and trust me it is too good a phone thand most of its rivals . Be it the camera or it's amazing sampled display  it is certainly the best buy in its range. And also #boycottchineseproducts

"
"

  The battery life is good. I charge for 2.5 hours and it works for the whole day. For gaming experience it is best for this cost. If you want to go for made in India product then I will advise you to go for it. The camera quality is superb and the display is totally HD this is one of the best in it. Audio quality is Dolby when you plug into the earphone. Internet + call connectivity is also very good.

"
"

  If you are a casual user. Its suitable  for multitasking. Amoled screen is best feature, 6000 mah battery is a plus but need to improve charging  speed. Can't  use Gcam dont know why. Processor is outdated, it is being used in almost every Samsung Mobile above 13k. Other companies  use varieties  of snapdragon & mediatek processors. Technology is changing  very fast samsung need to understand  this.

"
"

  The two cons are camera's face beauty mode is ok looking and beauty mode is not as perfect as like oppo phones and realme phones and heating issues is another major problemInstead of these two cons phone is best for performance,display,built quality, batteryApps are not able to install from playstore display is excellent and wonderful

"
"

  SAmoled display is awesome, the colours are vibrant enough and even the brightness is good for outdoor usage. Whopping battery about 6000mah hope that the battery backup will be fine and 15 watt charger is good but it would better if 18 watt charger was provided. Processor is good for daily usage but not for heavy gaming, multitasking between daily apps will be fine. Camera is also good but not the best.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader, bettery life & Camera Quality is best, I have used & after I can Said Samsung Galaxy M21 best Mobile. All Sensor is good. I like Samsung Galaxy M21. This Mobile Selfie & pic very nice fingerprint also helps for my Mobile security. & 6000MAH best Bettery for long time working. Samsung Galaxy M21 is Branded Mobile & I like also Samsung Galaxy M21.RegardsAjay KumarMobile No. ~ 8383026614

"

  A very awesome product of samsung in these modern time, Humongous battery life, In my mobile the battery lasts more than one day. As usual the camera Quality of samsung is better than other smartphones, it shows reality in camera. The best thing in this M21 model is the body of smartphone, like fingerprint scanner and camera are not popped out this is the best thing in these phones.

"
"

  It has a good battery performance and nice camera.Its finger print sensor is primitive and often doesn't recognize and has to be opened by passcode.It often hangs as well.I bought it for battery quality so I am somewhat satisfied.But if you are looking for gaming purpose than I won't suggest it.

"
"

  Product is good . I got defective piece twice and amazon is giving excuses that their policy can't address by exception issue where bank discount, old mobile exchange and other coupon discount was involved. They are blaming RBI for not able to return by old mobile value on bank account. I am terribly disappointed with amazon service.

"
"

  The main problem starts when it gets heating up. While talking phone gets heat upto 47-50 degree.. when you complain to Amazon they say till 48 degree it's normal.. while charging also phone gets heatup. Camera quality is not so good.. only additional feature it got is of super slow motion.. but in slow motion and super slow motion shuter speed blinks and is noticeable.. over quality is not soo good..

"
"

  Writing this review after 57 days of usage.Awesome phone in the budget.Battery life is really good.No lags .Camera quality is really satisfying.User friendly.Can't comment on quality as Samsung is known for the display..Being greedy... If we can get intellicam features in updates... It would be good..Over all, a device worth for the price...

  Display :- FHD+  sAmolad Display super combination amazing pictures viewBattery :- 6000 mah it's monster batteryCamera :- 48mp triple camera best in segmentCharging :- 15 watt it's not fast charger its but type c port and charger good for mobileProcessor :- its not for gamerFingerprint sensors :- its quick and fastOverall 4.7/5

"

  Tried to use for zoom / google meet. The camera starts continuously focussing and screen becomes bright and dark, nobody will be able to see what we write on white board.Secondly, when we miracast,  the picture does not occupy complete screen of the 43 inch Panasonic led. No adjustments.My earlier phones, Asus, Redmi worked perfectly well.

"
"

  Battery life is too Good, It can last to even 3 days with minimal useONE UI is so Good.Camera is ok but not good enough.No Lags and nothing to complaint about the phoneCan play COD without any lag or heating issues

"
"

  The phone stopped working after 15 days.Heating issue is there after 45 mins of continuous use like attending live classes or watching movies. Touch of the phone is not workin just after 15 days. Service center said that they will change the screen as the phone is under warranty but if anyone never expect this from brand like Samsung after spending 14k. It hangs every hour.

"
"

  Not worth it for 139991) Camera is not good you can get better camera in redmi basic mobile2) battry didnt perform like 6000mah3) performance is also ok not that great chinese phone offer better performance in cheap rate4) I brought this thinking that it is made in india also read many good reviews of it, but i did not find it worth phone to spend 14000rs.

"
"

  Phone performance is very nice amoled display using very colorful,camera quality it's better than other good quality, 6000mah battery back up very good but charge down it's very fast if I use phone chargeing down stand by just 12 hours only as well if I put to charge my phone getting time 2hours to get full charge compare other brand very worst battery back up and charging hours,

  Worst Phone ever used.Initially faced battery problem frequently phone was restarting contacted CC no solution some how it got fixed after some days.This review is for the Samsung customer service who keeps calling 10 times a day and ask to give a feedback about the phone. Hopefully this feedback should be considered by the Samsung team.

"
"

  The Display is amazing.Cameras are GREAT.Battery Life is MONSTEROUS.Performance is good too. - might not be great for heavy gamers, but for me C.O.D. ran totally fine and the UI is super-fluid.Overall, this thing is a MONSTER for it's price! Go for it!

  First of all the weight management from samsung is awesome.Although itz having 6000mah battery it feels very light weight in our hand..Cam quality is superb mainly in day light condition(both front and rear cam)...Very good mobile for light and medium gaming.For daily usage itz a killer...The UI is pretty god..Overall Best samsung budget mobile...If ur budget is 20k and u are a medium gamer Just go for it and Save money..‚ò∫

  1. Provided with 15W charger. It take approximate 3 hours to full charge.2. After 3 hrs charge it last for 1.5 Day Approximately for average user.3. Camera is doing good job.

  Best mid range smartphone for this type of massive battey, processor is also good, fingerprint also works well in this smartphone. I also bought Samsung m 30s earlier and now this smartphone.You can't find any other smartphone at this price point.

"
"

  Dont buy this mobile...Simply waste of money and time..Very disappointed by the battery performance. Its battery reduces like 3000 maH. And also take much time for charging..its not like type C.  Taking more than 3hrs for 0 to 90 % charging. And also get heated when charging...I applied for replacement and get it too..But new piece also has same issues...Bad mobile from Samsung m series..

"
"

  Phone is overall good, battery is powerful, Display wise better than redmi k20 , phone does not feel cheap and is light in weight compared to size of  battery,this is my first non Chinese phone after being in a mi family for more than 7 years , speakers are quite okay,ultra wide angle camera üì∏ is working as it is supposed to be,not a very big game lover but games likes candy crush working very well.

"
"

  Phone is working perfectly however sometimes it lags a bit sometimes..Everything's good except camera quality. It's a hit and miss .. Sometimes it clicks very good photos and sometimes dull..Battery is a plus point..easily lasts about 2days on moderate usage..charging takes 2.5 hours.SAMOLED Display takes ur viewing experience to next level.Go for it if u are a moderate user..

"
"

  The processing of applications is slow. It will take long time to screenshot while making video call. When playing high end games the processing is slow and some times it got struck and you need to restart the game in order to continue. Due to this problem I replaced and again I am getting same problems. Unfortunately my return period got over. So I have to use this phone anyway.

"
"

  Major issue with this phone it does not support hotspot on your pc/laptop, but hotspot connect with other phones, u have to run net by using usb tathering, I bought this phone to help work from home.I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED

"
"

  Samsung phone is very best mobile for all type uses. battery backup 3 days on internet use and very fast mobile.

"
"

  Network problem found in new Samsung m21.My old set Samsung G.Grand neoGt-19060 withthe same network hand set working OK.But in new set very offenely no network shows, signal will come up to 3 bars only in new m21,while I get 4 bars in Gt-19060 old set.Tell me what to do now.will arrange replacement or any other good handset?Please reply.I am sending this feedback from Gt19060.

"
"

  Very good phone, sometimes when I typing suddenly its stop for a while. Touch pad totally senseless then I have to minimize it go to other app,after that its working.I don't know its only my handset or other people's also have this issues. It's just not even a month.But as I m in remote area I can not visit service center. Rest all are very good.

"
"

  Highly disappointed..I brought this to avoid redmi series and every aspect of this phone has issues, from camera quaility , WiFi network detection and I can't even play simple games without lag...For god sake don't buy this phone...

"
"

  New phone. Delayed opening because it was a gift. When opened, touch screen not working. Amazon says return window is closed - go to Samsung.Ultimately, this is Samsung‚Äôs bad QA. My first and last Samsung phone.

"
"

  I have chosen this after a long research and the battery capacity that impress me the most, it takes approx 2 hour to charge and last more than a day. Fingerprint sensor is faster than expected. And also this phone looks pretty nice in hand ranther than in pictures given in product. This phone is very smooth in use. Camera quality is not satisfactory as I read in previous reviews

"
"

  I have always purchased a Samsung mobile. This my third Samsung mobile. I am I hard user of my phone due to work. I always prefer a Samsung . I  have been using M21 from 2 weeks it's an amazing choice. Camera is good battery life is also good. For a complete day use. Games run pretty well. Overall it's a good choice in under 15000 I always prefer Samsung than any other phone they are the best.

"
"

  Processor had to be better, Dolby atmos had to work without  earphone, but an outstanding  phone....love  it..before  packing  the  product  should be  free  from  corona

"
"

  My sim card tray is defective...after putting a micro SD card it is not detecting my sim 2...my device also ship with a slow 10 w charger while my friend got a 15w charger...very bad quality check by Samsung..

"
"

  After 20 days of working automatically touch is not working. Showed to samsung service center, he told mobile genuine problem and need to replace the touchpad.Not a good phone. Except this everything was fine. But touch is not working rest everything is useless. Don't buy this phone.Now for repairs minimum 20 days are required n i do not have 2nd phone also.

"
"

  Really suggesting you not to buy this phoneYou don't need to get impressed for just 6gb ram and 128 GB ROM. It's a scam to sell this defected setSensor problem alotScreen hangScreen glitchAutomatic switch offAgain and again.

"
"

  I am reviewing after 1 month:excellent display and battery life but it takes more time to charge the battery.In one hour 36% will charge.I am not a gamer so I didn't feel any problem with exynoss9611 processor. The only problem I felt with that fingerprint sensor it doesn't work all the time properly.Except fingerprint sensor the m21 is a real monster.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my mom, but I mostly use this phone.  Because it is very handy.  Its camera is very good.  The display of this phone is excellent.  Fast charging is one of the best features of this phone.  This is a phone that offers excellent battery backup.  It also offers excellent gaming performance at this price.  This is a phone you can buy without any confusion.

"
"

  Using it for more than 3 months now.....everything is working good ....performance , camera , display all are working according to their capabilities,...all in all on of the best phone at this price range..And obviously a non chinese phone..which we all want...i got it for 12699....now its price is increased but its of ....bcz you are getting a good hardware and software

"
"

  Battery life is very good, camera quality is also good. Its a strong handset as it fallen down many times from around 2 meter height, also thrown when got angry, but all these done with mobile back cover & glass guard on screen. In settings I have checked for blind people screen reading activation option is there. Its a beautiful smart phone for ‚Çπ13999/- only.

"
"

  Super Fantastic Mobile Under 15,000 Display and Camera Quality is Good and Features are so good Design and materials good But Battery Backup is not good Fingerprint Sensor Some Time Not Working Only 15 Walt's Charger In The BOX Not 18 Walt's Charger

"
"

  High quality Fingerprint reader gives smooth one touch access which is far better than Vivo and Oppo. Battery life which was earlier a concern in samsung phones now improvised and gives 48 hours 100 to 0. Camera quality is amazing. This camera quality deserves actually more price than it is available for users. So, overall i can say its an awesome phone at very economical price.

"
"

  First device i got was dead on arrival. I struggled a lot to find out how to return the Product. First the site asks me to install an app on a Phone which is not even getting on. Then they say Take a picture and upload then only I can contact the Amazon support.  After so much of struggle I was able  to contact the support and order for a replacement.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor... SuperbBattery life...Beast Battery..I use mobile continuously 24hrs good for heavy users no lags while playing PUBG..phone process is very goodCamera quality...Nice camera micro shots are super Night mode is just ok remaing super..I write this review after use of 1month....Samsung Galaxy M21 6/128 Excellent...ü§©ü§©ü§©

"
"

  This is a great phone in every aspects, the price, the main cam in daylight, massive battery backup, smooth UI. It has ok signal reception.. not low nor high. But there are some features that are exclusive for M31 considering these both have the same CPU and everything aside from main cam. M21 is way better than those Chinese redmi phones which gives you better performance at the cost of bad user experience and quality.

"
"

  It is my first  samsung mobile purchased. I am enjoying first time super amoled  display  with delightful watching  media. As for battery 6000 mah isn't up to mark , it's an average.I m not a gamer,  so I m happy  after  purchase this non Chinese phone.  Go for itüëçüëçüëçüëç

"
"

  You guys are taking lots of money for this m21 phone plz give some standerd quality to the customer to use and experience the good name of Samsung.i think Samsung is good company but now onwards my thinking will be changed.please replace my phone as I pay for this and please I requesting you guys this time send the phone with proper checking and that will not have any defect.

"
"

  Bought this phone for my father after his 10.or got unresponsive. No regrets.My father is using it for a month now and he is very happy. No lags and UI is simple and he is totally on his own for basic calling and YouTube, WhatsApp etc.Overall a good mid range phone.

"
"

  Midnight blue is the first time I tried anything different from black.And it looks really good.. The battery backup is too good.. Monster aptly describes that.Mobile seems a bit heavier compared to my previous ones , but the use of apps is seamless and smooth.No complaints from my side ans a very nice present to my father.I had bought the same mobile but black in color...

"
"

  I'm amaze after using this mobile Samsung Galaxy M 21 and I bought another for my spouse.  Need to thank Samsung for launching a great product with affording price.

"
"

  Within 15 days mobile was got pinkish screen.i went samsung care but they said you have to pay 5500 inr for screen.i hv refused. The seller is responsible for this.

"
"

  This is worth of value given but if you are looking for long battery life than  I would like to say this is not 6k MAH what Samsung is claiming it's just like 3500 -4000mah only, camera is gud but not the best as when you will zoom the pics you will see the difference rather than this everything is perfect. If you want to boycott Chinese items than this is perfect for you.

"
"

  Nice phone,  great battery backup and performance, but camera quality need to be improve more as compared to iPhone. Otherwise phone is really good at this price.

"

  I bought the 4 gb version of the raven black  phone. I must admit that if you're interested in a phone which isn't too costly and has decent specs then this is easily the go to phone to buy.The phone quality is very much appreciated compared to the price. Its battery life is great, its performance is very good.As a casual phone user I'm very much happy and satisfied with this phone.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader quality ok,Bettery backup ok but not like 6000mh ,camera is extremely good,though the ram is 6 GB, only 2.2 gb is usable rest is already acquired by system.

"
"

  ¬†Finger print is the best of this phone.Battery life is also very good and run upto a long duration about 2 to 3 days with 5 to 8 hr. daily useses.Camera quality is amazing of this phone.Best front and rare camera .Best pic. taken by this phone and also for making video.

"
"

  The package seems to be intact but the mobile inside the box seems to be little used (with finger prints everywhere). It is suspicious that it could be not fresh piece. But when we test the mobile as per instructions, it shows to be genuine mobile.

"
"

  Review after use:Pros:Good camera(yes videos at night wont be as good as higher versions but one of the best at this range)Good batteryGood displayGood AudioGood interface overallPerhaps the only con:If you have very small fingers, you might have to stretch a bit to reach the sensor.

"
"

  Its is the best phone under 15000 range.I am using it since 2 months and I loved its performance. It is all rounder phone.-The 6000 mAh battery gives you complete one day backup even you use it continuously.-The camera quality is also excellent.- The super Amoled display gives you a wonderful experience.- I also had a wonderful gaming experience on this phone.

"
"

  i purchased m21 got defective piece battery was having a bump and all sides of phone were open from front panel i have uploaded pics alsoamazon should check before sending the mobile to customersafter purchasing also i am not able to use my mobile as it a defective piecei would recommend all to not to buy from amazon this was my fiirst and last purchase from amazon

"
"

  I'm writing this review after using it for a month. Brilliant camera, huge battery life, brilliant display, fast charging (takes at least 2.30hrs to fully charge from 10%-100%) V happy with this purchase. Totally best budget, Branded smartphone. Go for it guyz. Big Thanks to Amazon and the Seller. ü§©üòÉ

  Hello friendsAfter one moth condition of my phone. color bleed at on point. I contact to customer care when this problem appear. They told me that go to service center and when today I reach Samsung service center at sikar- raj (System & Service center- sikar). They refuse to change in warranty.

"

  Handset is awesome, in 14000/- INR price one of the best mobile. It's comes with samsung super amoled display infinity U Noch. Performance also good but but not satisfied with processor. It's comes with samsung Exynos.I suggest it for daily use (movies, music, calls, ect...,), I don't suggest it for gaming. Battery is awesome you can use it easily one and half day.

"
"

  Samsung made a great return with low budget smart phones with best specs. I hope it helps Indians to say bye to low budget chinese smart phones.

"
"

  This mobile is real value for money and i bought this fror my sister and she liked it very much the key features of mobile are latest technology based and are :- * Its fingerprint reader is owsome * Also have best battery life * Camera is amazing

"
"

  very good product with great camera great battery life great fingerprint sensor this product will be a very good product in market. Health and this product picture quality was so good so good so good. You can see hundred eighty pictures in YouTube with this Samsung M21. Subhash who want to buy a phone under 15000 rupees taken by this phone easily the don't need to hesitate.

"
"

  Excellent product by Samsung. This phone Galaxy M21 is really worth buying in this segment. It's been more  than 4 months i am using this phone and till now it hast disappointed me rather I am happier now as I chose samsung over other brands. Blazing fast 4 gb ram rom is also good 64gb and camera is fabulous. The display is the best amongst all other phones in this segment.

"
"

  ¬†According to configuration phone dose not working properly. And Some of the feature are missing in this phone..1th oct 2020.: today I found a new problem in my phone when I try to open any application using my phone high speed internet connection sim Vodafone network connection is disabled automatically I have to restart again

"
"

  I have received a bill invoice copy after discussing with customer care, delay due to Corona lockdown.Thanks to Amazon for delivering a best smartphone in this budget segment of Samsung better than other companies.We should boycott Chinese products at any cost to reply the laddakh infiltration, I choose the way

"
"

  Luv it...Samsung should be appreciated  for this owsmm product with that reasonable price.Phone feel premium and have lots of feature.With the trust and reliability  of samsung .You have to compromise in gaming for some sort.if u r a heavy game.Otherwise it is the best phone.Most importantly #NOT CHINESE.and security is good

"
"

  Dont buy! Dont waste your hard earned money on this mobile! Battery  is draining like crazy! 6000mah battery working like 2000mah! Also draining battery while on idle state means literally 20% overnight without doing anything! Nam bade darshan chote. No matter you use or not your battery will drain. I haven't played any games only fb, whatsapp, and surfing.

"
"

  Overall performance is smooth and good but the problem is camera very poor front  camera and rear camera is ok ok and coming to battery its jus been 3days since i bougt this phone i cant tell as of now battery life is ok ok overall i would recommend as budget phone to purchase but if you a camera lover i would not recommend apart from that it a decent phone

"
"

  And Mobile looks like republished Mobile...wit dust while in unboxingthe Mobile... I'm total ....very much disappointed...wit the front camera.....very very bad.....one...in low light mode...camera  performance too bad....Disappointed  with  #Front camera...old Samsung  galaxy ....please please don't buy this mobile  total....waste of money.....othet than front camera...everything..is ok..

"
"

  it's price was under 12699 but it was increased to 14kfor it's price.. decent phonephone is not for gamingapps when opened too many tend to reloadno case cover provided in boxintial impression is a decent buy but have to check it in long term

"
"

  Battery Backup is not good discharging very soon, it's just 8 day I have purchase the phone. Never purchase any item from Amazon, flipkart is best for purchase and return policy. The nonsense technical assistance team is saying to go first service centre and then they will raise the return option . And blaming why not you read the return policy before buying the product.

"
"

  Excellent battery life..Display is awesome..No heating problem trust me....I m happy with the mobile and its features...However 2 star less because sound is quality is awful...as compare to my old phone redmi note 3...Very bad sound quality....in terms of bass lovers...not a suitable phone...

"
"

  The best things about this phone is ""display quality"" and ""camera"" in this price range. One UI 2 is also interesting.""Fingerprint sensor"" is working very fast, if it is slightly lower than the given area it could be easy to use.""Battery life"" is not looks like 6000mAh and it takes much more time to charge fully (about 2 hr 30 mint).Overall it is a ""value for money"" smartphone.

"
"

  Great phone . Decent battery and awesome display . I love this combination of greater display and big battery life  plus samsung . I bought this smartphone specialy for this deadly combination. Good camera awesome photos in day light and the one ui of samsung is great . I liked it very much .

"
"

  Worth for money good for gaming battery life is superb but EXYNOS 9611 processer lightly consumes charge little then Snapdragon  other wise best mobile it's best than other mobiles in this price Security level is one of the best thing in this mobile if you by a mobile in this price this is the best mobile I say that this is the best mobile as a gamer and also a normal user

"
"

  Very nice phone i had never used such phone like it in my life it's battery life is very good in first some days it's battery life is some small but after using it some days it's life became good as I had thought it's fingerprint reader quality is also very good it unlocks my device within just a second it's face unlock is also very good in time of night it's brightness become higher and unlock device in low light

"
"

  Delivery was in time. Everything is working fine. The fingerprint sensor is really fast and face recognition is really good and secure. No doubt about battery. At the end of the day more than half still remains. The camera is good. I have clicked many pictures and they are really clear and bright. Shooting videos from these device is also good. But the phone really heat up very very quickly.

"
"

  This is my first phone and I would like to say that this is the best phone under 15000.The camera is very good.And ofcourse with it's 60000mah battery backups .it can give more time on screen in comparison to other phone in this price segment.It have a cool display also.I am very happy to buy this phone.And the fingerprint responds very quickly.

"
"

  Best smartphone in this price range with great battery and user interface . Back cameras are really good. Gifted to my mother and she is loving it.  I find Samsung phones really worth the price .

"
"

  Best phone at this price . I bought it 12699 rs.1. Camera - rear camera is good but front camera is avg.2. Performance - perform very good in day to day usage . I do not play pubg so for me there is no issue in day to day performance.3. Battery - excellent battery life.4. Display -no need to describe its fhd super amoled so no issues for display.5. Design - not so good not so bad .

"
"

  Overall experience with this device has been great. Best phone you can buy at this price point. One UI by Samsung is smooth. I really like the overall user experience.Dark mode looks cool.The battery lasts for 1.5 days, Even after using my phone heavily throughout the day for work and personal purposes(This is absolutely great)Haven't used camera much, but the initial impressions are impressive.

"
"

  This phone has not disappointed me at all. The extraordinary battery life is something that is worth mentioning. It's extremely good in terms of graphics and the processor speed makes operating the phone a seamless experience. I recommend this phone for anyone who is looking for the best budget phone in the market.

"
"

  This phone is a nice product and has value for money. Its features are as mentioned and I found it suitable for my need. Problem area is the back of the phone which is made up of plastic so it easily gets scratched and spots if not covered by  a back cover immediately.  Battery life is very good  and once fully charged it lasts quite long .

"
"

  This phone is awesome and monster in all terms... But unfortunately in just 20 days of purchase screen stopped working suddenly and was forced to sent it to Samsung service centre. They said the screen needs to be replaced by new one. don't know but then after 10 days, I received my phone with new screen. All is working well. Is Samsung really and seriously does quality check before selling?

"
"

  Got it today on 17-07-2020 as I booked it on 13-07-2020. The delivery is on time and the product Samsung M21 is very good in quality but little heavy in weight. Overall look is 9/10 As I got it today so I will review it then will come back to help other more about this product.

"
"

  FACING HEATING ISSUIE BUT SAMSUNG SERVICE MANUFACTURER  DENYING  FOR SERVICE  BECAUSE IMEI NUMBER NOT MENTION ON  WARRANTY / P SLIP

"
"

  Display gone today after charging and phone was hearing too muchI m shocked on this worst experience of performance of samsung phone that bought just before three days and display of phone is gone.This is terrible

"
"

  User experience is disappointing. Placement of finger print reader is awkward. I switched from Moto G6 to an older Samsung version to this, and Moto was far superior in all aspects.But the worst part is the overload of Ads on the samsung set. Unwanted advertisements everywhere. It feels less like a personalized phone and more like a billboard.

"
"

  I am very old Samsung user since 2013.(This my 5th samsung mobile) But this time with Samsung M21 it really Great deal and value for money.If you are very pragmatic person and really value for money then must go for it.Note:- I did not want to give pros and cons as I actually got what then have written in their product descriptions

"
"

  Good productBetter than mi note 8 and note 7 proI choose samsung because good servicing is available all over the india.Good cameraBattery goodFingerprint sensor is slightly slowNice displayOverall a good budget phone in this segment than any other oneThis is  samsungTrustful

"
"

  The display is awesome.The processor is fast.Camera is really good.Battery life is insanely long.The specs are worth appreciating and the phone is worth buying.

"
"

  M-21 having fantastic look, battery backup is also good,camera quality also good but not satisfied me as I expected,no heating issue,fringer print sensor work properly,I wrote the review after 20 days use the phone , this phone having a good budget phone under 14k.....if u planned to buy a Samsung brand phone under 14k bindass go for it...

"
"

  Camera picture quality is excellent.Display is Awesome.Finger Print sensor is lightening fast.Battery life is a major plus point.

"
"

  This mobile is very weak in catching the network signal where strong signal is available.  Youtube vedio streaming quality is very poor. I got tempted to buy just by seeing the mobile specifications. Heating issues are there.

"
"

  Everything is OK with this phone but not that much speed when compared to redmi, realme phones because of this exynos processor.. If you want a phone with best display and massive battery and a average speed mobile means you can try this mobile.. Its battery backup is 10 to 11 hours screen on time..

"
"

  Best phone in this price rangeI don't face any frame drop in pubg and no hang problemCamera is way better than any Chinese phone,(Redmi note 9 pro, and pro max,real me  etc.)No ads, No vulger notification,I suggest you to go for 6 Gb ram and 128 GB storage so that you secure your phone for future.A very good alternative of Chinese phone.

"
"

  I am writing this after using Samsung m21 for more than ten days, from day one it starts  showing Samsung's typically quality obviously hanging and the other problem with this phone is it could not even open Google chrome whenever I tried to open chrome, phone gets hang. I am suggesting people before buying samsung make sure you are strong enough to cope with the difficulties you will face..

"
"

  I am having a great experience with this phone :-))At this price we are a such a good quality of product that to by Samsung. The most loved part is its display,  battery life excellent,  even the camera works pretty well. One thing which this should be improved is its charging speed. Rest the phone is very rough and tuff.  You can manage  most of your daily activities on Samsung m21.

"
"

  Not Happy. Display  is stop working know 1 week. My phone (Samsung Galaxy M21) screen goes black  but the buttons (power, home) and bottom lights are still working.Strangely, the phone works just like usual. It still can't receive calls, messages, chats or any notifications, but the screen is black/blank maybe that's caused by some system problems/errors that affect the screen.

"
"

  Camera quality is superb battery life is fun can last 2 days if you watch 1 movie a day and 1-2  hrs screen time  for full time screen users battery may work full day but very good option in price segment only 1 flaw I feel biometric reading like face is way much better in my previous  phone comparatively  but other features I am happy are much better that my previous phone

"
"

  i am giving this review after using for a week ,mobile was good but some small things they have to change ,(i) mobile charger connector was not good not proper charging(ii) phone is getting heat while speaking ( like a china mobile)

"
"

  Phone is overall ok but the battery charging time is very bad. It's take almost 3.5 hours to charge 100% at initially who knows what happens after 1 year of use.

"
"

  Excellent phone and battery backup is my uses for complete 2days. And camera quality is super .Then very very more important for I am notice that Display is very excellent super quality best display in Samsung brand mobile Their not any compression for other brands . Display is very super . And overall Samsung M21 mobile super best range that price. So Mobile was Buys don't any objection .

"
"

  Good product I write review 10 days afterPubg  good playDisplay verry niceBattery  good  but not a verry good 6000=5000 mah  Product sand but not give me a product purchase  invoicebill sound quality verry niceScreen verry good

"
"

  Overall performance of this phone is very decent and the battery life and screen quality is awesome. But the camera stability seems to be very low especially after this One UI 2.1 update. It takes time to open the camera app and there's some crash or lag while shifting between front and rear camera. Night mode could be more better. Hope it improves with further updates.

"
"

  Sir , Phone is not able to working ..It doesn't work properly ....Phone is hanging most of the time nd now there touch not able to work , we are not able to open the phone ..Touching System was not working any moreSo we request you sir to help us for repair this phone... because warranty card is available ...Kindly request you sir to resolve this problem ...

"
"

  Very good mobile as per price... Almond HD display, very good battery life, nothing much new than other Samsung mobile but battery and HD display are inaf to satisfied me at @ 12699....for 64 gb varient... Just go for it.

"

  I like this mobile... But display quality is not much as good as m31 which comes at 15999 rs with 6 gb varient and 64 mp camera....and m21 is with 12699/- rs with 4 gb ram and 48 mp camera with little bit low quality display than m31...so its huge difference just with rupees of 3500/-  so wt and buy m31 it is best mobile at that price range

"
"

  If you miss this, it can be a lifetime miss. Display , camera , touch response , processing ,..... everything about this phone is adorable. I love it. #Hail_Samsung . Don't wait grab one ....#Update after a long term usage.The keyboard actually freezes sometimes.. it's irritating... bt it's ok..  I'm in love with it

"
"

  Bought this for my mom after reading the reviews. The phone is good. Got it in blue and looks quite decent. Although the body is plastic. Has an okayish battery life. The rear camera is good. Good quality photos but the front camera is not upto the mark. Since my mom doesn't play hardcore games and only needs it for basic stuff so it serves the purpose.

"
"

  More than a week and noticed just one thing that the battery doesn't perform like a 6000mah one. Heavy usage discharges it in less than a day that too without playing any games. I think it night be  a software issue, as m30s with almost same specs provides better battery life.But other than this, a good product in this price range.Hope that s/w update will improve battery life.

"
"

  It is very good. Fingerprint reader is very fast and phone also. 1st day there was a heating probelm but from 2nd day all good. Battery is good but not like 6000. Camera quality is too good. Overall product is good no doubt.

"
"

  Writing review after using this mobile for a month.Display -10/10Camera-8/10Battery-8/10.(although  fast charging is there but it takes almost more than 2 hour to charge fully)Network-10/10. Both sim work on 4g volteOverall its a power packed mobile in budget segment. I will suggest  this mobile to everybody. Its an allrounder.

"
"

  I am unhappy with no duel app, no multiple choice in call recording, no screen recorder.no inbuild app for cache clear and app lock, issue in network, battery was not working like 6000mah. if you resolve these issues, then it would be best phone of my life.

"
"

  Wow display (S-amoled)Wow batteryWow UI better  than stockWow SoftwareComfortable screen sizeWow reliabilityWow security and privacyBest mobile to purchase in 15k

"
"

  Samsung phone will Hang, sooner or later. It will frustrate you. You won't be able to use basic apps let alone games. There is some problem with Samsung which they can't rectify. Bought this M21 and I'm sure I would never buy another samsung mobile afte this.

"
"

  Worth of every single rupees spent, good battery life, good camera, decent build quality, screen is awesome,Decent phone for normal user.Adding this after playing cod for two months, great to play cod game in medium graphics settings. Moderate heating is there but its manageable and nothing to worry about it.

"
"

  Samsung has been making phones in the Galaxy M series out of plastic to keep costs down. The Galaxy M21 feels like it was designed with a tight budget in mind. The back panel is made out of plastic and has a glossy finish. It picks up fingerprints very easily. Samsung does not provide a case in the box, so you'll have to wipe the device often till you buy one yourself.

"
"

  I was waiting to write a review on this phone based on my rigourous usage.. My final Opinion is value for money with quality camera and battery backup compared to some high end phones as well... I would recommend this Phone to my family and friends.. I wasn't happy customer with Samsung 5 years bak.. But now the M series has changed my opinion towards Samsung for good.

"
"

  Overall it's a decent phone at this price. A battery life that you can't believe, bright display with night mode, processor good for normal usage and a nice camera setup to produce natural colours. Samsung M21 is a good purchase for me.

"
"

  The phone is very good. Exactly same even if you guys from store, I was worried I won't actually get the phone and iit will be fraud but that isnt the case. Everything works quite well. No screenquaerd or transparent cover comes along. I would recommend.

"
"

  I am very very happy to get this phone. No one phon available  in the market in this budget and camera quality is very best bettry back up up to two days i have suggest this phon my office colleague relative and our friends.................Thanku samsung

"
"

  Good phone in such price. It's been a month of using this mobile now and ain't faced any issue. Battery life is awesome. Able to use it for almost 3 days, moderate usage. Sound is loud. Not lagging. Fingerprint touch is fast enough. Photos look good, though depth is lil less.

"
"

  Overall good. If you're looking for a great battery, decent camera and excellent screen, this is the phone. Perfect for online classes, YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp.

"
"

  Its found that during  charging  mobile. It very heated..like put in fire..???Please  risponce so as possible..what can I do..should  I will replace..one more  thing identified.. price..enter on mobile  box 15449/_ n I will pay 15999/- why should  this??

"
"

  Pros - Worth of buying it. 5000 mAh battery really good. Gives a backup of around 14 hours for continue usage to watch movie online.No hanging of phone till now and camera is okay okay.If you are looking for long lasting battery and nice display, go for it.Cons - it's bulky. Weight is more than average than other phones at same price.

"
"

  Battery performance is fab ...and fingerprint sensor needs to improve a little as sometimes it didn't work properly..camera quality is awseome with addition to many filters u can make hyperlapse and slowmo vdo and add music to it ..sound quality is also good ..but I think this phone is not made for games

"
"

  A great phone In this budget with infinity notch and great battery life with 6000 MAH with a decent processor Exynos 9611 and a nice camera with triple rear camera 48 + 5 +2 and front with 20 MP  I am using this phone since 2 months i am glad to be having this phone but this phone got hearing issue because its processor is not very powerful and then it's got cool in 15 to 20 minutes

"
"

  I bought it for my mom... She only uses whatsapp and YouTube... And the phone is good for its excellent screen and battery life ...Though it takes 2.30 hrs to charge from 10-100%And if you are expecting fast performance don't ever buy this phone... And for games NO NO NO...

"
"

  Dont waste your money on it1.take 3 to 4 hours to charge fully and battery backup is only a day2.build quality very bad3.camera quality like make the photo over colour and unnatural and lack of details in photo3.having ad like mi and realmeSo it would be a clever decision to buy realme or mi in this price#bye bye samsung

"
"

  Received a cracked touch screen set which we came to know after getting it check at Samsung Service Station, the set started malfunctioning after few days.Getting the touch screen replaced from service station at own cost because this is not covered under warranty.Never expected such service from Amazon where a defective set has been delivered.

"
"

  Awesome battery backup !No need to charge phone uptown 2 daysGaming performance beast!Camera quality far better than redmi phones!To many options for great photography3 card slot and no worry about storage!Multi tasking is very smooth and accurateSuper amoled display is my favorite inSamsung phones !Volume is ok for me

"
"

  heating on continous high speed net use. If use, wifi it's ok,no heat.Camera average and ok for price range.Battery takes more than 2hrs in full charging.Finger print and face unlock are 'better'.It's  an average+ phone  to buy in this price segment. I Bought  4/64 in 13999.

"
"

  Owsm phone, I have gifted this to my mom. She was very happy n she told me that ithis phone is very user-friendly.

"
"

  Overall performance is good except camera quality. Based on price it us getting offered if compared with other brands, camera offered in other brand is much ahead than samsung.Also speaker volume is low and need to be worked upon by samsung.Thing which is positive is battery life and brand promise.

"
"

  Working like a Charm. Superb battery backup. Nice cameras. Good built quality. And always separately nothing to be mentioned as it's super amoled display. Bought it with a price for 15.5k. In this segment it's the most compact and affordable phone one can cherish.

"
"

  The touchscreen of the phone stopped working within 2.5 -3 months of purchase. Samsung support center takes 2-3 working days to get it repaired. 2.5 months and with good usage, I did not expect the Samsung phone to stop working. I tried a hard factory reset and other troubleshooting but nothing worked. For approx 13k-15k phone, this is very unreliable and not worthy.

"
"

  Awesome & user friendly, altogether excellent phone, but one thing I would like to ask amazon that transparent cover is not available with the pack where as I purchased A 31 from samsung retail shop cover was available inside the packet itself so please avoid these  small actions ,rather more respect for customers who has great value for u for the last so many years.

"
"

  The Samsung galaxy m21 is,as it goes-'The monster'.packed inside is a massive 6000 battery which goes from 100-30 in a day if used aggressively.the camera is a 48 mp camera which takes good quality pictures.The 6.4 inch super amoled display with a tear drop notch is the cherry on top.The processor is decent for day to day task.Overall a good package for this price point.

"
"

  Best phone in the price range. Specially the battery back up is super awesome. Love this phone. Would highly recommend to anyone looking in 10-12K range

"
"

  It looks like battery is just 3000 mah not the 6000 mah, with very minimal use also phone is giving 12hr backup only. Phone takes around 3hr to full charge. I am really not happy with the battery quality. This is the first time I have bought Samsung and I am really very disappointed. If you are concerned about the battery life, I won't recommend anyone to buy this

"
"

  Don't buy this phone for PUBG Mobile .This phone provides innumerois Lags while provided with good internet connections .If u don't play PUBG ,then phone is perfect.

"
"

  Best mobile at this money...No use of dslr ..Inbuilt dslrs..üòÇüòÇ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§By the way great phone.....

"
"

  Pros: Battery  Display  Lower sar value compared to other  Chinese mobilesCons: not upto the mark of camera ( dull  colours)48 mp  3 hrs of charging time  No Internet speed meter on notification  bar  Notification light  Not a mobile for heavy gamers  Finally best and worth it mobile under 15k if you are not a gamer

"
"

  Nice budget segment phone from samsung.battery and camera quality are superb.face unlock is fast,but fingerprint sensor is slow.this phone charges in 2hrs 15min,but sometime this phone takes 2hrs 35min to charge.display was superb and speaker quality is good.I got 1¬π/¬≤ day battery life in heavy usage.gaming performance is good.I brought 4+64 variant.

"
"

  The product is awesome. It‚Äôs one of the best from Samsung in this price range. Camera quality is very very good. Battery is unmatchable in this range and lasts around 12 hours by single charging. It doesn‚Äôt get heated while using. Display quality is so good..apart from above It‚Äôs made in India. I strongly recommend this product to others..it‚Äôs worth purchasing. Go for this !!!!!!!!!

"
"

  After 11 days battery is not charging,After keeping 3 hours charging it is 55 % charge onlySo Amazon this is not correct I paid this mobile 15000 Rs andWithin 2 weeks already problems startedWho's fault is this , it is yours responsiblity to  look ,now how can ill shop with you people tell this is called fraud I want answer call me  are you going help me with thisüòï

"

  Network issue guys.Net was running good for 1 month but after that net not running continuously. Network keeps dropping . Net connection not consistent. I also talked to airtel and my area has got optimum network . Mobile tower is just 200 mts away from my home.!!Never expected this from Samsung.

"
"

  Bought this for my dad during lockdown. Although I got it for a higher price of 14000 whereas previously this was available at 12800 this device is a mega monster in terms of batter performance. Display of the phone is also very stunning. Otherwise its a standard phone with an average camera.. the phone is great for a person who wants to use it as a standard phone in the budget range.

"
"

  The Samsung m21IS A BRILLANT PHONE ADDRESSING ALL TH RIGHT PAIN POINTS FO THE CUSTOMERS,  WITH AMAZING BATTERY LIFE OF ALMOST THREE DAYS AND SUPER SMOOTH SCREEN  TO USE. ALTHOUGH I DON'T USE MUCH CAMERA BUT THE ONE PHOTO I TOOK HAD A QUALITY OF A DSR CAMERA.  AFFORDABLE PRICE and GOOD RAM nd INTERNAL MEMORY.  Its definitely a good buy.

"
"

  I switch from apple 6 and believe me the screen and battery life is awesome in this budget phone. Must recommend phone. 64 GB is also enough for non gaming users like me. Make sure add a screen protector and back cover along with your order to keep it safe rest this is performed very cool in all sense.

"
"

  Awesome phone, Mega monster,good camera quality,awesome battery backup

"
"

  Nice phone in this range(13999) and I got in 10% discount in sale... It's been a week and Look, display, battery life and Camera quality are really good but fast charging is not that fast because of 6000mAh battery and only 18W charger. And one thing is you will get exynos 9611 in all recent samsung mobiles. It should be changed. So its better to buy M21 than M31.

"
"

  Very nice and value for money product, fingerprint is a bit on a slower side, camera performance above average which is expected in this budget segment, the key board often hangs, graphics very nice, audio quality good; better in speaker with Dolby atmos on, over all a decent product in this price segment and yes it's good for day to day usage definitely not a good option for gaming

"
"

  I purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 on Amazon. Received it on 18/08/20. on 28/09/20 the screen started flickering. and after few minutes it became black. i did factory reset. but problem persisted. today handed over the mobile to Customer care center. I saw on the net that many people are experiencing the same problem with Samsung Galaxy. its disgusting.

"
"

  This is by far one of the best in budget phone I have EVER bought.Brilliant camera,  Beautiful performance, Way above average gaming feel, 1.5 days battery backup on full usage mind you.And on top of that, Its gorgeous looking.And at the end of the day its Samsung.I don't think you can ask for a better Big brand name phone in this price range.

"
"

  I really like this product at this price segmentFingerprint-Should be a little bit fasterCamera Quality- Very accurate,very sharp and 4k video awesomeBattery - Full day EasilyScreen-Awesome super amoled

"
"

  Best budget Samsung phone.Not heavy as expected. Best handy phone.Display is not like Samsung old s.amoled .I think Samsung decreased the s. Amoled quality. Battery is not getting 6000mah , hope the battery will better after 10 days of setting up of batery time. Any way it's a good phone for those who have a strict budget for a best Samsung phone.

"
"

  1.Display is very Good.2.Battery charging takes a long time and a lot of heating issues3.Microphone doesn't have noise cancellation or not effective.While on video call,fan sound goes to other side mobile speaker.Very irritating. Samsung should solve these issues by software update at the earliest.

"
"

  If you want a non chinese and a tier 1 brand smartphone. this is the one to go for.It has a solid display,speakers,battery and a very fast fingerprint scanner but for that you have to have your fingertip clean,the exynos processor is a very capable processor to handle all the daily tasks you through at it. pubg ran fine too

"
"

  This is my 4th samsung phone . But I am not at all satisfied with this phone right now . It's been only a month I purchased and it has started to  hang frequently and also the fingerprint sensor is very bad . I am not at all satisfied. Please do not go on the features written it is completely opposite to what its given.

"
"

  Very dissappointed  with  Both Amazon  & Samsung. 2 times I ordered & returned,but I  still got already used Mobile & frequent call drop problem & call connecting problem is there,With very poor performance.

"
"

  Budget friendly phone with amazing battery life, good RAM, Nice Camera, and good processor,Most likely thing is that it has a SAMOLED Display at this price range as well as Dolby Atmos which makes Movie Experience like Cinema..üòç Video Experience is more than a Expactation..Rather choosing china phones this is the very good option for Non chinese phones..

"
"

  Best phone in this budget everything  looks fine and works well apart from finger print sensor everything  is excellent.most important  local product not the Chinese brand

"
"

  Mobile looks gud but the build quality of the mobile  is waste  and camera quality is worest n mobile gets hanged Frequently and mobile takes more tym to charged as compared to other mobiles if Samsung has given 30v charger instead of 15vThis is the given after mobile is used for 1  month

"
"

  This is the most suitable phone for me because I don't play pubg I only use my phone multimedia use YouTube movies and music and this phone is perfect for me and it got 6000 MH battery I use the phone whole day and it remain 35% at night

"
"

  Very Nice Phone.Pros : Nice display and awesome for daily useCons : Not Slim as rest of phones in this range but trust me you will not regret. I bought this phone back to back for my daily office use. Go for it

"
"

  Pictures taken by camera are of worst quality in my experience . In low light the pictures taken are so disappointing that I am feeling like cheated buying this phone . Buy this phone only if you don't bother about camera quality .  I am using another oppo k1 with 20 MP dual  camera but it's performance is far better than this 48 MP triple camera .

"
"

  ‚óè  This smartphone by samsung is an amazing device.‚óè  Its processor is also very good for pubg and other games.‚óè  Camera quality is very amazing.‚óè  Fingerprint scanner and face unlock is very fast and accurate too.‚óè  Overall this is a very good budget smartphone with a good brand name.

"
"

  Camera is good(Performs well most times)...battery is best of the lot..but Fingerprint reader is slowest amongst all phones in this price range...OS too is not the smoothest...if looking for shift from Chinese(MI, Realme etc.) than be ready for atleast 10% drop in performance...but don't think that's a big thing if we need to hit them hard..

"
"

  Assam Meghalaya  border experience with ths pin code 783127i gt this kind of box... but hopefully phone was good condition... n Delhivery boy not using any kind of safety  like Mask n hand gloves n Sanitizer ... on ths pandemic time... n appreciate to Amazon at ths Pandemic time the deliver my gadget.. on my needs... thanks u Amazon... for avail this code...

"
"

  The performance of the product it good. Issue with Camera application in low light. It is mentioned to have Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, but I didn't feel the same. There is scratch on the screen and when I found it I was exclaimed to see it. How can it be possible if protective glass is available and watched so many screen test videos. Otherwise, good budget smartphone.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is just as what mentioned. A MONSTER. The main highlight came to be its 6000 mAh battery along with the typical samsung UI and the latest Android 10. It's best at its security. Just some glitches are observed but are negligible. The phone more handy and has an easy grip. It's a recommendable phone for those who look for a phone for running a longer time.

"
"

  I am heavy user of phone and battery last for 12 hrs on full charge. It truely has monstrous battery @6000 mAH and the SuperAMOLED screen makes your video viewing capabilities√ó100 and gives a true color. Truely the best smartphones launched by Samsung.

"
"

  The phone required replacement as the speaker stopped while playing and the audio jack was not working ,rest camera and battery performance was gud but it caused a lot of trouble and now the replaced one hangs many times.

"
"

  Mobile should got very heat on the time of apps download Heating problem. In simple browising only phone gets heated up in upper side. When asking for replacement amazon customer care they are fooling us. Very pathetic condition. photo shoots...

"
"

  Review after 25 daysAll features mention in the specification sheet is upto the mark.....Only camera need to be improvised....therefore 1 star reduced

"
"

  ¬†Bought Galaxy M21 (Raven Black ,6GB/128GB) variant.I am a New Samsung mobile user.It's been almost 3 months now and there is no issues with performance of the phone.Battery life is good,camera is good.Phone has very good value for money.Thanks.

"
"

  Superb phone in each and every wayGood finger lock sensor of high quality and rare camera is too better as well as front camera is too good with varient features.Baterry lyf is also good and what i say about charging speed .Wow! What a fast charging speed .It is a good quality phone .There are features which are very useful for users

"
"

  Hi, After one week my handset charger connector is not working properly.1- when i insert the charger pin in hand set then its not starting the charge.2- After inserting the pin, I have to slightly pull the pin back then its getting start to charge the phone.Initially it was OK, but after one week from receiving the phone I am getting this issue.

"
"

  This phone hangs multiple times. very annoyed with product, ordered 2 phones. both hangs, same problem, wants to return this product but amazon replied that their is no return policy you have to buy same product. how can i purchase same useless product. please don't let yourself to be in this situation. atleast amazon should be return such products in given time.

"
"

  I bought two pieces...one is working very well but the another one was not that good..recently the second one fell from the bed and landed on its screen ..and the whole screen was damaged the screen became totally black ... the phone is not durable it broke even after it had both back cover and tampered glass on it  . Its not durable ..other things are fine ..

"
"

  Samsung  Galaxy  m21 is really  a affordable  and good phone.Has good display quality and this phone is good for playing pubg lags may be occur but not because of the phone, they occur of i don't  have good network connection ü§£üòÖ.It has good front as well back camera.I dislike  one thing about the Samsung  that they didn't  give back cover and glass gaurd.

"
"

  Camera pixels are of high resolution the pic. is clear and doesn't differ even after zooming. Battery is monster but still phone is consuming more power that battery lasts for 1 day perfectly while using roughly which should be more.I am enjoying this phone hence it's perfect value of money Thank you Samsung for giving amoled screen at affordable price

"
"

  I love the picture quality nd the screen look of this phone it feels so premium unlike Chinese phone ,nd the look of the phone is awesome moreover if I talk about the performance ,it is good nd justify its price I think in this budget segment it is beast better than Xiaomi nd realme go for it

"
"

  It's been only 18 days of my buying . ,Hanging problem arose most of the time even after having 6GB Ram & Internal Storage of 128GB . After investing 15k-16k money the phone hangs of Samsung M21, according to me it's not a good deal.. Really Samsung had to work on such problems that seems unpredictable under this price range of Smartphones now-a-days..Sachin Kumar Singh

"
"

  Google play store not working properly & mobile data is consumed too fast.Unable to download apps from google play store...very poor performance...pls don't buy this product...totally unsatisfied after spending 15k for this waste mobile.

"
"

  Very good phone, excellent camera, display is fantastic, pretty fast. And battery is very good even it does not drain after two days.

"
"

  Good camera for the price. Display is very crisp. Battery backup is not so great for a 6000 mAH battery. There are some minor lags in the ui after the recent software update, otherwise it was good. one ui is not my favourite & there are lots of Samsung apps pre-installed. You can't uninstall all of them.Sometimes it shows ads on the lockscreen.

"
"

  Few issues that I Have Faced:1. All the Bluetooth devices are not getting connected (including BOSE and Sennheiser)2. Issue with Photography when done directly from Apps like WhatsApp.3. Phone have problem of continuous Hanging for Longer time. You need to Close all the Apps to get the thing working.

"
"

  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Samsung M21 but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone

"
"

  Awesome mobile but charger cable is too short.I have take pic of coconut tree in full dark and am totally satisfied with camera clearty.Very fast and best suitable for professionals and people who want genuine mobile.

"
"

  Don't buy Samsung m21 phone or even any Samsung phones.As I am facing touch issue from first day and now after one month touch became unresponsive & phone became useless.Samsung support only giving different way to reset nothing else arranged from their side.At last I just lost 13999Rs for buying this worst phone.

"
"

  After the use of 21 days....Its is heavy and thick phone, Audio jack and charging ports are at bottom...It is not so convenient or comfortable to use the phone while charging and earphone plugged....Audio speakers are worst, Gorilla 3 is not so better I would suggest to go for 5, scratches can easily obtained, Camera is good but charging is too slow, it takes 1-2 minutes to gain 1%...

"
"

  A good product within that budget..Delivery speed even in Corona period also very good..Thanks to Amazon for endless service to customers. If Ram speed little.bit more is helpful

"
"

  Best  phone at this price range, brand wise and performance wise, The main attractive thing is its DISPLAY, is awesome. Battery backup is very good, I don't know about the gaming on this device, But for a normal user other than gaming is very best phone , please don't hesitate to buy I,m using it from 90 days ,No hanging , but little heating while fast charging.

"
"

  Mind blowing mobile.The best in the price range. You can buy for1.The Amazing sAmo LED Display2. The Stunning Cameras Quality and Features3. The Excellent OneUI Features4. The Fastest Fingerprint Reader5. The Smoothest sensitive touch screen6. The Lang lasting battery PowerAnd the best brand mobile @ the best price

"
"

  This phone is one of the best phones under 20000 with huge battery capacity.  It only has a 15w fast charger but it has 6000mah battery which is more than expected. The design is really good, looks better than in the pictures. If you're looking for a battery beast, just go for it.

"
"

  First handson experience with the phone was awesome.One Ui has made it simple. Camera performance is good, battery standby is also up to the mark.It's a budget phone. What else do you expect. And everything is here.Except the fact that this does not have fast charging to cope up with the 6000mAh battery.Apart from this..its a winner..

"
"

  First of all the design is simple.Battery backup is awesome.Camera as far as you know Samsung is famous for the quality so no compromises on that . Ultra wide sensor is also good .Display is super cool . Having sAMOLED is what you need at this segment.  Colours are punchy and vibrant .Phone heats a lil bit but i think every phones dies that .

"
"

  Hey ! If your looking for a budget phone with a powerful battery and an amazing display as well as a good performance...just blindly go for this product!! The Amoled Screen and the features of this phone priced at such a low cost is too good ! Thanks to Amazon for delivering this package early and for the good packaging . I just love this mobile .

"
"

  Sumsung galaxy m21 is an excellent smartphone because it is giving super amoled display which is the best display at the time even in flagship phone this display  is top the mark and 6000 mah battery life you can use whole 3 days at normal use and camera quality of front 20 mp and back 48 is excellent and fingerprint reader is very.. fast at flagship level and samsung make every thing at top...üé∏‚ù£Ô∏èü•∞

"
"

  I brought this mobile from amazon good mobile good battery good camera everything was good not a single disadvantage with the mobiles but only thing is not backcover and earphones in the box however the mobile was awesome üòéüòé

"
"

  With this smartphone iam completly disappointed with the battery life and it is not like a 6000mah but it is draing like a 4000 mah battery phone and it also have some heating problems,though it has good processor. Iam just ok with this smart phone....

"
"

  Fingerprint = 10/10Battery life = 10/10Camera quality = 8.5/10Basically all the features are awesome and the device comes with an outstanding build in quality along with a good display and efficient colours. I'm completely satisfied with the device and i think this is the best among all the devices of this range.

"
"

  Not satisfied with the battery life. Samsung claims that this phone is powered with 6000 mAh battery but what I experienced till now is that in realty it's battery performance is worse than 4000 mAh rated phones. It even takes 4-5 hrs to get full charged, whereas again the company has provided the phone with fast charging adapter.

"
"

  1. Phone Quality is good2. Phone front and back look Nice3. Camera Quality Is Good4. The Charging cable is too short (uncomfortable to put safe charging)5. Battery life is good but its takes long time to full charge ( may be due to the its battery capacity 6000 mah.)My rating for this phone Samsung M21 is 10 out of 10All over I recommend this phone..

"
"

  Bought this for my Dad.Decent phone by Samsung. Agreed Chinese brands offer better specs at this price, but for a non Chinese, tier 1 brand, this is a big leap.Also please note that battery life is good enough but not mind blowing even though it has 6000 mAh unit. This is due to Exynos processor which seems to draw extra power.

"
"

  I bought first time from Amazon & I never expect like this.. Mobile display not working properly.. I gifted to my loved one. I have to return back the item. I don't know how to support will get from Amazon. Here after I don't like to purchase online.. Mobile delivered 0n Oct 5th 2020.i registered the complaints. Total time waste & disappointed..

"
"

  Almost 2 months back we bought this piece online. Seems to be very good one but slightly heavier. Don't like much the quality of finger sensor. But camera is super cool. The selfie cam is also nice, photo quality is good. Battery is life us also good, once fully charged will last longer till a day. I won't say it is must buy but it's a good piece within budget.

  Samsung M21 is perfect budget smart phone. I have never faced any single issue since it is purchased.Super AMOLED display give me very nice user experience.I loved the display because it is curved at the edgesBattery last longer.Good Cameras.No Bloatwares.I‚Äôve liked it a lot and definitely served the purpose.

"
"

  Recommended, for who seek longer life, a trustworthy servicing, adequate specs(for student life). Quoting "" small things actually matters""- that can only be experienced.(saying having seen Ch**ese big names with bigger specs, but ""Darshan bade kaam chhote"")& processor 9611 is just an underrated one as by youtubers but actually praiseworthy.Lastly One UI *Im Loving It*

"
"

  I have noticed small things1. The headphone symbol is not showing while you plug your headphone2.No option to turn off camera sound3.half and hour charge with in box charger 15w will you only 15 % charge my old phone performs better4.In 48 mb camera more you need to wait for 1 min for saving the photoThat's all now full review soon

"
"

  This is one of the best phone from Samsung at this price range. Build quality is awesome. It gives a premium quality feeling. Battery backup is awesome. Camera is okay. Video quality is superb. Moreover you can play relatively heavier games like on this without any lag.

"
"

  I like battery  working is good and design  is good and processor is good.I think Samsung  phone will struck  but  I used 1 month  I didn't  face any issue.  For normal  usage phone is excellent  and for gaming I don't know .Battery  charger  if they  increase  more watt I it is  more useful

"
"

  Charger is not up to the mark, looks like local one after using it with the phone, even tried with another phone, but not worthy, suggesting all new buyers, please check charger and put replacement within a week of purchase else would have to be disappointed like me.....

"
"

  Battery 5/5 - 6000mah lasts for about 2 days.Display 5/5 - SAMOLED Full HD+ display is just wonderful.Performance 3.5/5 - Not a gaming phone rather a phone for day-to-day use. Still no lag or stutter was found while using.Software 5/5 - Samsung's OneUi 2.0 on top of android 10 is one of the best software out there. Its clean and easy to use.

"
"

  Phone is good bt charging is not fast as stated in the description. It takes 2.5 hrs to charge in the powersaver mode. Normally it takes 3hrs. Except charging rest is good.

"
"

  Bought this phone recently, and happy with it. Ticks most of the boxes. My only concern is the refresh rate  which is not that great. Sometimes when you look for the running apps in the background (pressing the left bottom button), the transition is not very smooth. I am hoping it will improve. Overall, great 4.5/5.

"
"

  Samsung is finally a frontrunner in the budget segment.The biggest plus being the battery and Super Amoled seals the deal. The exynos 9611 chipset handles multitasking pretty neatly.Your search should stop at M series if you are looking for a smartphone to satisfy your daily phone needs with battery still left to spare ( barring rigorous gaming ) .

"
"

  Phone so heavy ...not slim at all....calling always defective as in btwn call voice stopped...using from last 15 days and its evry minute i wish i could return it .internet not so great.volume is also usual ....nothing great at all.....js an old phone in new box.had used J7 earlier...so every time bad experience , now its my last Samsung phone ever in my hand.

"
"

  This is an Awesome Phone with a Amoled Display and a great battery life..A slight upgrade from M30s, especially on the aspects of Camera, which I've been using before this..I noticed some heating issues initially..If you're priority is for battery and display you can surely go for it..

"
"

  Not a good deal at this priceIts selfie camera  is inconsistentIt shows different skin tone while taking selfies and different after processing in gallery..what's thisIts a Rs14000 smartphone...it should perform better..selfies are horrible after processingDear Samsung plz Fix it

"
"

  User friendly i love it in this mb sound quality and battery , camera super ....auto brightness when we watch the movie in mb  eye product specifications awesome .... worth for money thanks for Amazon delivery i expected date ....

"
"

  Very bad phoneIt has lot of defect.Amazon please pick up ,been 3 days I raised return request.Media sound is not working properly, even message tone, what's app ringtone not sound and gallery  videos do not make sound.Wifi connectivity and hotspot fails sometime and need restart

"
"

  I have been struggling to find some good performance + battery backup product and M21 has done this. Overall this is v good mobile in terms  of performance + Battery .  I will not say anything about camera because this is not my requirement but camera is also good

"
"

  We have recently purchased samsung Galaxy M21 midnight Blue (4GB/64GB)model in June 2020. After looking many smartphones and compare with many other we choose Samsung M21 only because there is no other option available in this price range with these monster specifications.I'll like to thank Samsung team for this awesome budget smartphone and gave ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê to this smartphone.

"
"

  Main highlight of this phone battery camera and display previously I'm using A30 which is just a year old but camera is not that much great in my old device so i switch to M21 and it's completely in budget.

"
"

  Am writing this after 15 days of usage.Monster battery phone!! Well said! Nice phone with super battery backup! Battery5/5Brilliant display quality!Display 5/5Decent speed!I bought 4 GB ram,quite decent performance! Doesn't struck on gaming.Camera quality is ok. 3/5 .wide angle is good.Overall I appreciate samsung for this wonderful mid range phone.

"
"

  This product is really awesome at this price pointIt is good in terms of privacy also because it is made in india and product of samsungIn Hand experience is also great sAmoled dispaly 6000 mah battery widewine l1 support makes this  phone amazing for watching movies and YouTube videosPlease do buy this product you will love it

"
"

  If you want a cheap budget trustworthy amazingly working phone, then go for this.1. Battery works as long as 2 days without any too much of rough usage.2. Camera is just awesome with many different pro modes and wide angle views. Clarity is also amazing. Overall you can go for this phone to go with the current  technology pace.

"
"

  This review is after almost 3 months of usage. I am not satisfied with the phone, as the battery mentioned doesn't seems so, itl gets drain on a single day after normal use I never play games on phone.I am facing some legs as well, I can hear ringtone but doesn't see anything on the screen, same happens when I make a call.

"
"

  üôÇüôÇüéäüéâüéâüéâüéâIt's very very good product.....Because Dolby atmos speaker and software is worthy for cost and then operating system is very easy than other mobile phone.....ü§óü§óü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©It's look like a royal finishing for glassierBack side ...Attractive ....üòíüòíüòíOne disadvantage is Samsung secure folder not activate in this model

"
"

  ¬†This is the worst phone i have received from amazon. Initial product which was deliverrd, was also faulty. Had speaker and mic issue. After my complaint, they replaced it with new phone and screen and touch is not working just after 10 days. Pathetic service.... very disappointed...

"
"

  6000 Mah battery is provided by samsung and still it give only a single day charge and this will not happening me but all three persons who taken this phone with me.One more point as per the resolution given by samsung 48 MP camera but camera is not at all good..... Dissapointed üòîüòî

"
"

  I have loved its wide angle cameras. The photos are just awesome. I use thi phone mainly for kids online classes and he plays alot of games throughout the day and battery life is amazing. The good thing is it's fast charging capability.Overall a satisfactory budget friendly non-chinese product.

"
"

  When I walk up in morning I got my order. It was very smooth I love Samsung.Display : it was very smoothCemera : I took a selfie it was awesomePerformance : will share my experience later.I placed this order in Prime sell and got good discount on it along with "" No Cost EMI "".Thanks Amazon to deliver it quickly.

"
"

  Useless brand. Plz don't buy samsung service waste. If any issue they won't replace the product. Within 10 days of purchase my mobile was not working. Plz do t buy any Samsung mobile

"
"

  The Samsung M21 is an amazing phone for the price I paid. Love how so many features can be used including the fingerprint scanner , camera and the face recognition. This smart phone is being used by my grandfather and he feels it's super easy to use.He usually watches YouTube and Facebook on it the whole day, with an outstanding battery performance.

"
"

  Nice Mobile,Very Smooth to Use,Amoled Display light yellowish colour,Good Battery life,back side of the Mobile is plastic Finishing body so too much of scratch are occured,Camera quality Nice but when we take pictures in low light pictures are not good very Blur.Dolby üîä Speaker very loud and clear sound provide.But price is too Much.üëçüëçüëçüëç

"
"

  Very nice phone most attractive features are battery, cameras, the ui and my personal best Dolby Atmos which is very awesomeüòç.Go for it .ü§üüèª

"
"

  It's not a monster as it was mentioned. Batter life is normal like 4000mah.Camera quality and finger print sensor are good .it hardly connects 4g lte.poor network strength.Finally,battery life and network strength are not reached my expectations. Just an okay product!

"
"

  ¬†It is very hard when you want to to buy a mid range smartphone because of lots of option. I used to be fan of realme redmi but know i prefer to buy made in india product i chosen this and very Happy to share it's a good choice great battery good camera good processor. Overall happy with the device üòç

"
"

  Phone get hanged, and performance and speed of mobile is not up to the mark.Location is not accurate, speaker is also a problemFirst I thought its a cheap buy but after using a month its a waste of money.

"
"

  It's the worst experience and wastage of time... 1st item was getting excessive hot within 2 -3 mins of use, so requested replacement and Amazon did their best to replace within 3 days, however 2nd product also having the same problem... So it's the Samsung product, which having issues... Wanna get rid of this... Want to return this Product and like to go for something else.

"
"

  A really good budget phone to opt compared to MI or vivo or any other phone in this range.I upgraded from samsung J8 and the experence is good.Screen and camera is impressive.Battery is normal.If you are not into a lot of fancy stuff with phones this is a good option.

"
"

  It's been a few months since using the phone, it was all good until there was a software update. Noticed the battery charging time significantly increased since then and more importantly the phone heated up so much during the update,  the screen cracked by itself. I called up customer care and they said it's not covered under warranty. Not a good experience.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor, battery life and face unlock has always been a low point in almost all Samsung phones. I have used Galaxy J7 Max,Galaxy J8, Galaxy M30s and now M21 and all the phones had the issue with these.But overall the phones are a value for money. They have long life and most important thing is the are Made in India.

"
"

  Best at this price. Slim and weight is lower. I bought 6gb 128 gb one. So no memory full problem. Its sufficient for any normal tech savvy person. Battery is 6000 Ah , higher than any other phone you have used. Performance is good. I think this is best smartphone in this range.

"
"

  ¬†This is the second M21 I bought My wife is using it for 1 year and now I have bought it for my Father as well.The battery backup is 2 days easily.Good processor does not hang.Camera quality is also best in the same price range phones.Most Important is Brand Assurance It's samsung guys.

"
"

  Display and touch sensitivity are excellentPics doesn't look like 48MPMovie viewing - Good with this budgetDolby sound - not actuallyBattery- Too slow...very very slow. I felt charging for half a day.After heavy usage, it lasted for 12 hrs (6 to 6)

"
"

  I am writing this review after using this mobile for more than 3 months, camera is ok just like any other normal phone, processor not fast rather it is slow, touch screen is good but fingerprint sometimes doesn't work and battery is like 3000MAH not good at all, its a below average phoneDoesn't match with the expectations as mentioned in the features.

"
"

  Very very good performanceBrilliant camera, huge battery lifebest under this price range.Amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display

"
"

  Battery life is worst you need to charge it for 3-4 hours and after getting full battery it won't last for whole day. You need to get it charged after every 10-12 hours.

"
"

  Got a refurbished phone.Side of screen had few dents clearly anyone can make out that the screen was replaced.Who should be responsible amazon or samsung dont know .Will be replacing my unit. Lets see how fast amazon does that.Be carefull do a close watch#check the images attached .Box was little old (not a big issue)

"
"

  Nice Product

"
"

  A supperb qualify product, its back is polycarbonate but more durable than many glass backs, camera needs a little bit improvement which can be done by OTA update , although battery life is awesome, haptic feedback is also good.

"
"

  I like this smartphone i am first time user of the samsung galaxy smartphone and i clearly sure to say that this was the best budget phone under this 16 k segment and for pubg players it us surprisingly best phone to having hooursy of gameplay without any lag with the beast battry performence...I want to write more reviews for samsung....Thanku

"
"

  I would bought samsung m21 before one month ago... I could clearly decided to bought this in a March month... Dreams come true in September 2...  I was really satisfied of this samsung m21... Some minor disappointment are front camera is not clear in night time shoots...and some times finger print will not be quick to access..... Battery life is fully good

"
"

  Don't buy ....worst purchase ever...Can't expect this type of product from Amazon .....using it for a month ..there was a issue with the headphone socket ..i thought my earphones are old & when I got new earphones ....there is no difference ....also if you are on a video call or something it heats like a MI phone .....very very disappointed with this

"
"

  I have used this phone for around 15 days. All of a sudden the touch screen started malfunctioning.. It started to work in auto, without even touching.. I tried restoring factory settings. All the data got erased and while rebooting, the touch did not work properly and I could not configure the settings. I am not able to use the phone now..Very Bad Experience

"
"

  Battery is awesome, camera is not that bad and display is also really good but phone back is prone to scratches, still not case in box. This phone becomes hot when you use mobile data; wish I could take Xiaomi or realme. I am literally crying because of this phone. Also the Slow-mo is kinda Hella stoopid, Hella full blury. I don't know what to do with this phone.

"
"

  Camera quality is sound.Gaming Pubg is better than what I excepted .Battery  is huge even after playing it stays on.Good battery.ConsNo backcover n screen fraudsThe charger quality is very cheapy may be old school Samsung style.Good build quality for device.

"
"

  Best mid ranger in this price segment.  Not for professional gamers but performs well for casual gamer picture quality is good but I'm facing a problem..... Dust goes inside the wide angle camera lens which clicks blur wide photos ...but overall the phone is awesome

"
"

  This product is super smooth and comfortable to use. It has an amazing battery life which could be adjusted according to ur usuage.It sometimes gets heated up(not much). Camera quality is good,  also allows slow motion videos. But the battery's life lasts long when u use the dark mode however while traveling u can save it for 3 to 4 days . Fingerprint sensor is also faster.

"
"

  Amazing phone for a budget below 15k. The camera specifications work well in night mode too. Seamless switching with high end processor and battery backup lasts longer. Binge watching is easier with this phone in lockdown.

"
"

  Wonderful Camera with its 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra wide, 5MP depth and 20MP selfie camera.Huge 6000 Mah battery, which lasts for 2 days(keeps me away from charger for 2 DAYS!!!)Smoothly opens all apps.Beautiful sAMOLED display worth more than what I paid for.WHATELSE DO WE NEED! GRAB IT RIGHT NOW!!!

"
"

  Finger print reader in this phone is too lazy and battery life is not much as prediction... Camera is awesome.. Samsung maintained their camera quality...And phones body look is good... The amoled display is stunning.We can buy it because it's price worth . Don't buy it for gaming... Other wise you can go for it

"
"

  Samsung M21 I am Using After 2 MonthsCamara Front And Back Always Good And better Performance Dynamic Range is AwesomeBattery performance full use 2day I'm impressed for battery performanceDisplay MI LED so better than another mobile always good and better performance for this segment Samsung M21

"
"

  Samsung skipped earphones and charging cum usb cable length shortened by few more inches cost cutting strategy sucks. Other companies some times offers back cover and protective glass.

"
"

  This phone is awesome. You can surely buy it. It's camera, fingerprint reader, camera quality is OP (Over Powered). You can also play pubg easily. It's looks are stylish. The phone is superfast. I made an unboxing video of this smartphone and I will soon upload it on my YouTube channel i.e. Techy Boxing in a few days. So please watch my video and like, share and subscribe also.

"
"

  Trust me its The Best smartphone under price range of 15,000 rupees .. I have used the phone approximately a month and I found no issues at all..camera quality is magnificent ,it provides a Long lastic Battery life,lookwise its perfectly designed and with all these trust of samsung smartphones.. For sure i would suggest it to everyone who wants a budget phone ...

"
"

  Excellent phone. Looks and features are good under this price segment, but net is not up to the mark as compare to the chinise phones. In oppo, mi, etc give internet speed better than samsung galaxy. Samsung realy need to improve and upgrade net speed.

"
"

  We received a phone which was a faulty piece. The flash was not working. We had to visit the service center multiple times and still did not fix it. In the end we had to return the product for refund coupon. It was a traumatic experience of 2 months without a functional phone and to constantly trying to reach out to someone to help us fix it or return it.

"
"

  A very nice product from Samsung. Display is gorgeous, battery life very good and performance is smooth for day to day usage. Haven't played any games so can't say about that.Only problem is the galaxy store, should be having an option for un-installing it. Pls Samsung.

"
"

  Bought this for mom who isn't really used to smartphones yet. Camera is real good for the price range. Bukeh has some flaw with not very clear edges during selfie. Yet it takes stunning pics. Works better than my S9+ camera now. Battery works fine and the display is good too.

"
"

  Screen- crystal clear and very smooth.Battery backup-Exceptionally good. Once full you can use it for the whole day with heavy usage.Camera-Very good picture quality.  sharp and clear images.Looks- very beautiful phone. Blue colour is very beautiful.Drawback is that it is very slippery and slightly  larger for comfortable operation with one hand.

"
"

  Within a month my screen was broken without any physical damage. I received product on 09.08.2020.  On 05.09.2020 while charging the phone, the screen was broken for it's heat generated in mobile. Now I have an doubt that they are selling new products or not?

"
"

  This  online product is very poor as per performance(like speaker volume very very low, clear voice not found with full volume and  that is the big problem on this product  from other ordinary mobile and processor very slow , I am trying to connected  amazon but amazon very disappointed me,no customer asst. assist me, So  I request to others please ignore this online product

"
"

  Good battery life. Camera should have been better. Price is little on higher side.Over all good phone.Prompt security update from samsung is what I like most.

"
"

  The phone is mind blowing the battery backup is easily for 2 days in single charge the fast charging is too goodThe screen experience is so smooth with super amoled screenCamera is fantastic the quality of camera with 4k recording the picture quality is so good in zooming the picture you can easily see little thing alsoThere is no competition of samsung m21 in this price point

"
"

  Product was delivered on 20th Aug one week working nice but suddenly touch not working yesterday on words it's totally field Samsung proved it again there products quality üëé not a first time already I was bought Samsung s3 on that is also faced this type of issues and again it's repeat . Worst.... Not explain by words. . üò°

"
"

  This mobile has all good features that have given and very worthful handset..very good quality of camera ..battery life is good enough..look is also good..i personally find various features in camera only very unique hardly find in any other handset..i believe in samsung brand i strongly recommend you to buy this.. your hardearn money will not be wasted.

"
"

  A nice phone . It has a good fingerprint sensor. The camera is not effective in taking high quality pictures from a long distance. Although the processor and touch are great.Battery life is good. charging once a day is sufficient.  Screen quality and touch are bang on. I really like the fast charging time.But it's also relatively heavier than other phones.

"
"

  This is one of the worst phone from Samsung.. the second day itself my phone touch stopped working completely.. they had to replace the phone and still touch is not smooth but as Amazon policy they cannot refund money only can replace same phone..so have no other option but to get it replaced ..Think before buying this phone..

"
"

  ¬†I am using Samsung galaxy m21.This is one of the best quality product. Very good battery & camera. Fast charging. This product maintains superior quality. Excellent one.

"
"

  As usual, Samsung phones hang more often, despite of 6 GB RAM and improved processor. I guess my old Asus is still a better option. Camera and battery back up of M21 is really good. But yes that's the only budget phone one have from big brand like Samsung.

"
"

  Advantage*Good battery life*Best camera quality*Fingerprints sensor work fast*Better UI*Performance Ok*Value for moneyDisadvantage*Charging time*Only 15W fast charger for massive battery

"
"

  Finger print slight slow... Battery back up n camera are excellent... Thought 100btines b4 taking Samsung bcoz OS was not that user friendly 5-6 years back... I'm fan of MI... But I took M21 after a long thought process... I'm very happy with the mobile now .. OS is very gud n refined... A gud buy under 15k...

"
"

  Excellent but at this price, Camera quality is superb, especially the wide angle shots. Battery life is very good, three days goes with normal useI was planning initially for m31 consisting the Exmor camera sensor, bit looking at 6gb/128gb memory pack settled in this one, I think good choice

"
"

  I purchased this phone on the 6th Sept. 2020 and got the delivery on 7th. Battery 6000 mHA but I couldn't realize the difference with 5000 mHA. If the phone use for long time with Data and Hotspot on then it becomes extremely heated after sometimes. Otherwise the product is good but not excellent.

"
"

  Too bad it get heat faster and with in a week itself mobile is hanging issue started don't buy this product by seeing  ratings in Amazon or other

"
"

  Exynos 9611 has some network related issues, otherwise best buy under 15k. Do not buy if you are a PUBG addict. PUBG will lag after half hour of play, frame rate drastically  reduces.

"
"

  Been using this for 3 months now and I am more than happy with phone.Best screen display .Good camera with good image processing.Batter awsome ,my battery lasts up to 2 days .PS I am not a gamer üòãConsidering battery of 6000 capacity its light weight and slim.No lagging as of now .I really like UI .its genuine ,easy and attractive.

"
"

  Samsung, as always, has given the best product for the price. The product came with Android 10 and is excellent in terms of touch-screen functionality and battery life. Its RAM is sufficient for non-gamer consumers. The camera works great and can be used for scanning purposes. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an affordable phone.

"
"

  I bought the Samsung Galaxy M21 (Blue), 4GB-64GB variant.1. Brilliant camera and display.2. Battery life is very satisfactory for my use.3. Superb performance4. The fingerprint sensor and face unlock feature is fast and accurate.I would highly recommend this phone to everyone. Thanks for reading.

"
"

  The performance is exellent, the battery is superb even the look of the phone is very attractive but i was expecting a much better quality for camera.  It is 48 mega pixel main camera but picture quality is not as good as it should be but the selfie camera 16 mega pixel is very good even much better than main camera.Over all a very good phone. Valua for money.

"
"

  1.Camera is not satisfied really, it is really need to improve ,my honest opinion.2.Other thing like back pannel is really garbage you would be ashamed to show your mobile with out cover.3. At least Samsung remember the few years  back ,I am telling about ear phone.4.update of software...I don't know what would happen with M series ...Thanks.

"
"

  Phone over all good n friendly while using but in video call audio is not going to the next caller i try using whtap video calling, jio video calling, normal video calling but there is no voice mic is not working in video calling, please help.

"
"

  I use it for its primary purpose which to make and receive call. As I already have a desktop computer most of the other goodies are suplus.

"
"

  Good product .. but gets lil slow after some months . Dont take it as a negative thing As the processor is not snapdragon. Still 84gb available but works lil slow. But 5 start for the build and for being pocket friendly.

"
"

  Please don't buy this product by any means. It has been very sad experience. It's almost 15 days phone has been delivered and it's has stopped working.. Screen completely frozen and not even allowing to restart. Never expected this from Samsung product. My return window closed on 7 days back . I am not sure what to do now.

"
"

  The phone is nice. The camera brings out colour, especially green very beautifully. The battery lasts long enough if you are a normal user. The display takes the breath away.However, I am facing issues with the phone. It randomly switches off by itself. This is the only drawback of this phone. Rest, it is a nice buy.

"
"

  Hi guys.. the product camera , battery life , fingerprint, is good... but the main problem  is some time (one day) minimum twice to thrice time hanging (like struck) the mobile. Minimum 10 to 30 minutes.. So think before buying.

"
"

  This was my first Samsung phone and ngl it was definitely worth the money. The fingerprint scanner id good but everything else is absolutely top notch. I loved the FHD+Amooed display and it even has a great camera And the battery of course never ceases to amaze me although it takes quite like bit of time to charge it completely. Best phone in this price range GO FOR IT.

"
"

  Samsung's display is always best and M21 display is awesome in this price range and battery backup is also good. Fingerprint Sensor also work very fast just tap and open. In recent times Samsung improves Camera in budget range and mid range phones which is also a good point. This phone is simply best in this range with the security of Samsung. Love it.

"
"

  Best phone in this price range......6000 mah battery which charges very quickly with fast charging and supports you for more then two days with moderate use....camera quality is also good....the quality of pics is better compared to its competitors.....clearly shows the difference....you can't expect more then this in this price range....just go for it

"
"

  A complete package in a budget range. It has a massive monster battery which is  easly last a day and half. Good camera with nyc looks even the finger print is also good and the sAmoled screen is great, watching multimedia in this samsung galaxy m21 is awesome. Overall am very happy after buying this such a great experince of a samsung galaxy m21 phone‚ù§. I love it ‚ù§

"
"

  I didn't expect from Samsung.. I used Samsung past 10 years ..now I purchased m21..it is quite unexpected...worst battery..its only for 3 to 4 hours while continuously working...I totally disappointed....

"
"

  At this price point this is one of the best smartphones around. Exynos 9611 chipset, 6000mAh battery, 48mp rear cam, 20mp front facing cam, FHD+ sAMOLED display and lots more to offer. Daylight performance of both the cameras are great. Samsung mobile will also provide two major android updates over times. Happy with the purchase. Worth recommendation.

"
"

  In beginning Heating problem near to top side when calling ....Some time ok some time feels ......After some days of use it become normal.....But some times I feel s like over heat while calling...

"
"

  Very good phone in budget. As described battery backup is very good but its take min 3-4 hours to get full charge.  Camera quality is not as expected. Also in night blurry will come. Its take @11.5GB internally Storage to run system out of 64GB. It is litte bit heavy. Performance wise its good and value for money...

"
"

  Superb product within budget 6GB and 128gb.Plus features- display- battery- camera- look- cheapest mobile within budget (6GB and 128)

"
"

  The phone is lit. The battery life is very good. For a camera based user like me, this phone is a very good option. But there is a small drawback. The phone doesn't support GCAM. Although, you won't remember GCAM because its stock camera is so massive that it fills all the gaps üëçüôèüèª .

"
"

  Phones are all but vital to our modern existence, so choosing a good one is important and I choose Samsung Galaxy M21..a long lasting battery, superb camera pixel clarity and off course better speakers and speed.. as a phone you are the oxygen, heart that beats, voice that birds sing.guyz go for it. Thank you Samsung

"
"

  The screen was broken. There is a cut line on screen. Trying to replace but I am not getting any confirmation call or acknowledgement from Amazon. Please assist

"
"

  Good phone, battery last for 2 days if 100% charges, value for money no doubt

"
"

  Phone is getting overheated within half an hour usage. Battery is not holding even for one day. Though I have only very limited applications and I use my phone hardly 2 hours in a day.

"
"

  Decent product overall.Great display.Biometrics kinds of slow.Inbox charger takes eternity to charge the phone.Decent camera.Battery works fine for 1.5 days on heavy use.Navigation could be better on full screen.

"
"

  I am getting this produt 3 days before but mobile's display is not working properly I am raising the complaint through costomer care they are told we are arrange the technicians visit but technician not come what can I do.....?

"
"

  The phone color is blue,but only the side pannel on both side is black,i dont know is it a fault or not, if any one has idea please tell me.However Camera in daylight superb, low light photography is noisy, super display, processor average,Battery like 4000-4500 mah,not giving back up like 6000.overall a budget phone for daily work.

"
"

  Has  quite nice battery backup to sufficiently  last upto one whole day , nice photo quality , video quality , sensitive fingerprint sensor , fast charging and amoled  display  .I honestly  recommend  you to buy this product if you are looking for a nice looking phone that could fulfill  your regular activities very efficiently  and effectively.

"
"

  Likes -  Battery backup, Screen display. Amazon Delivered genuine product,. .Dislikes -  A little heavier, A little delay in apps opening. Not satisfied with Response rate. . Charging capacity to be improved.

  The Phone is Amazing In all terms it justify its priceThe big 6000mah battery give about 2 day battery backup and it charge in about 1hr35min with it 15 watt charger the samoled display is amazing it is crystal clear and camera is also best in this price segment. It is real monster

"
"

  Excellent phone in that range,battery backup is soo good,and awesome camera quality

"
"

  Phone display gone in 14 days. Service center mentioned  they will replace if it is bought from store. For amazon purchase,  amazon rerturn policy applies.  Unfortunately  Amazon  gives inly 7 day return  for this phone. I am stuck with repair  from service  center where parts are not available.

"
"

  ¬†Am not able to use this mobile. This worst thing what i receive from amazon. I rceeived on 21 july and am using this device from 23 july 2020. This product not working more than 10days. Touch not responding this device is not damage or broken their aftr this kind of quality you provide. This is very worest experience to me.

"
"

  I switch to Samsung after many years. The phone is quite okay,It has special features from past:1. my phone has restarted around 20 times in 2 months2. The amoled display doesn't work most of times.3. The phone  takes eternity to get fully charged.Yes some good reviews are there1. Amazing battery life2. Good price range

"
"

  As expected, good phone and good quality camera.Battery life is not that great but can be easily used for the most of the day.Finger print reader is reaponsive and no issues with it.

"
"

  I'm have been using this phone since one and half month. Best non chinese phone in this price segment at 14K. Positives are Battery life, oneUI2.0 , Back camera , SAmoled üëçBelow avg front cam, Old CPU,GPU.Verdict: for non gamers the M21 is better choice.

"
"

  Horrible product. Please don't purchase. Within 1 month the screen got defective and customer service says it's out of warranty. They're asking 5500 for repair. What to do don't know üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ there was no physical damage. We must have bought a phone of 20000 instead

"
"

  Awesome  product  , I really like camera  and  beauty look and .very good performance I am really lucky to have this mobileBattery came quality awesome. Little bit unsatisfying about become hot when using

"
"

  Iam using mi note 3pro(4years).., changing to samsung brand...., Good battery,nice and budget smartphone.. finally good mobile

"

"
"

  Phone is perfect package.Camera speed screen sound and battery life all features are amazing.Fingerprint is slightly slow reacting and charging takes a fair amount of time but you can't complain about it in this price range.Go for it.

"
"

  First if all it has a monster battery of 6000mah with super amoled display. It's  monster phone at this price range no other phone can beat it in its  ram management. It photos are super awesome  give many options in video like(slow motion,hyperlapse,superslow motion,Ar emoji e.t.c)I have bought  2 of them and really  happy  to buy this phone at this price range

"
"

  I bought this phone on a prime day sale. aug 13 received the ph. Unboxed and try start the phone. Touch completely not working. After 2 weeks amazon arranged the replacement. Than aug 22 got the second ph. That phone also have pblm. Heating like induction in charging and simple app usage times.

"
"

  This model has serious issue. Front Camera is not good as expected, or written in spec. Mobile hotspot is not visible by PC. Very disappointed.

"
"

  Surprise to me after 3 day it's screen is hang and not working phone . Problem with screen only.Thanks to Amazon they replace the pic with new one.

"
"

  Battery charging takes more than 8 hours to fully charge. Phone is heating in normal browsing.I ordered a replacement. Then I got this damaged phone. Totally frustrated with the purchase. Complained to customer care and waiting for issue to resolve.

"
"

  Overall a nice mobile at this price range with utmost quality better than Redmi, Mi Note, Oppo, Vivo, Realme, etc. which are cheap Chinese products. But this Samsung is wonderful in build quality & also good in providing OTA updates for Android regularly.

"
"

  Almost everything is great about this device.If they can use Snapdragon processors it might get more better results.Or provide more information & comparison of Samsung Exynos processor.For mid range phone also, I would say Samsung is really acquiring the market faster .

"
"

  Pros üëç1. Awesome looking screen2. Great battery life3. Cleaner UI experience with no ads4. Excellent Daylight photos (in the budget)Cons üëé1. Night photos don't come that good.Rest is all good

"
"

  Great budget deal with amazing battery life around 12+ hours of heavy continuous use.  Cameras with excellent features, clarity and zoom. Smooth performance however does lag for a couple of seconds sometimes. Security is flawless with both face lock and fingerprint. Overall a great buy but consider getting a silicon back case because the back is too slippery smooth.

"
"

  30-07 Got a defective product.  Its hanging  always and taking 4 hrs to charge the mobile. Just went to service center yesterday.  They formatted it. Nothing done for charger. Its hanging again. Now laudspeaker is also not working..  this is worst experience with Amazon.31-07 see the uploaded photo. Unable to use hotspot and bluetooth tethering.

"
"

  This phone is much better than any other phone brandI think that everyone should lose the thought Samsung phones hangs as for last 5 days I am using this phone and playing heavy games like cod on high graphics and there is no sing of hang.But I think that Samsung should make his product packing  battery as Xiaomi has better packing

"
"

  As I have purchased this phone from amazon, I can assure you that it is the best phone in this price range ,also it will help to counter Chinese mobile phones ..perfect phone if u want to go for non-Chinese products.Battery backup is too good, till now no issues related to phone hang , camera is good , awesome picture quality..Go for it!

"
"

  The phone hangs like the tripical samsung as a decade ago.So frustrating, even it is hanging while surfing Facebook and instagramI m not talking about any gaming and allThis time I trusted upon samsung after 10 years and the same problem occurred

"
"

  One of the best products in this price range. Battery, display, picture quality excellent!! Incase on a budget, this is the best bet. Samsung has really innovated in mobiles to fit all bracket pockets. Have been using for over a month now and no flawsüòäüòäReally happy and have recommended to many. Even playing games dosent suck up battery too much. Excellent product!!

"
"

  very much disappointed with the product received. whoever is watching this review,it is my request not to buy this worst mobile phone. also don't buy any product from Amazon, their service is very poor. They don't even return the product or support the customer. Battery is draining very fast, camera is poor quality etc.

"
"

  Battery life is very strong... Camera quality is awesome... But the back side of this phone is not so much shinny as chainese phone like realme, redmi etc...But overall Galaxy M21 is a lovely phone‚ù§

"
"

  M giving reviews after using this phone for almost one week. I loved this phone and also the black colour. The camera quality is awesome as i have attached some pictures with the review so uh can see it urself. The battery backup is awesome. And also it feels comfortable on hands neither too large nor too small and also it is lightweighted. Overall i love this phone.

"
"

  Received the phone quite well before date given the current lockdown situation. M21 is an excellent budget phone with right set of features. Build quality is durable. Starting the phone was quite easy was not happy seeing some third party apps. It's been priced good for blue color but I think the black model is not priced adequately. Over all good phone.

"
"

  Everything is best by Samsung...but I disappoint from the Amazon.  I got perfectly packed box but when I unboxed the phone ...there was missing the data cable.I was made a complaint but no one gives a satisfactory answer.

"
"

  Phone was good with this features and price we are luck to get from SAMSUNG brand . My bad luck when I purchased this mobile there was no cash back offer. After I have received phone in next day Amazon gives 10% offer when we are using Citi Credit card.

"
"

  Less than a month and the screen has shown a leak of some fluid that looks like a leak...Faulty product that is very poor in quality.Needs to be replaced by the seller and ensure that no such issues occur hence forth.Amazon to note and ensure compliance

"
"

  The phone was very heated when I use internet and wi-fi,and when I puted on charge. I think this phone was 2Nd hands, when the phone was reach to me I call back to customer care told the problem and return this phone, they're not understand my problems and say that is no problem. We don't return the phone.

"
"

  Worst buy ever  Display gone in 6 days use only. Now the bad thing is I am on tour in another state and also can‚Äôt replace it.I consider myself supporter of India, just because of only I prioritise Samsung over any other Chinese Make device.But My all hard earned money gone waisted.

"
"

  Samsung M 21 is a great smartphone at this price , budget friendly smartphone with fast fingerprint sensor along with 6000 MAH battery,the battery life is excellent ,the quality of camera is also excellent , happy to buy this amazing smartphone it's so good and it fulfills all my requirements which I want from my smartphone , Thank you samsung and amazon for this great smartphone üòäüëç

  The Galaxy M31 uses the same processor as the Galaxy M30s: Exynos 9611. This might not be the fastest processor around, but I got fairly decent performance with 6GB RAM and 128GB expandable storage inside. In fact, the performance is slightly better, thanks to Android 10.Thanking u

"
"

  Samsung is the oldest and the most reliable company this phone is very pocket friendly and it contain all the essential features. Camera quality is very high, battery life is also good and it comes with fast charger also.One should not think  twice  before buying  this beauty

"
"

  Phone is awesome in that price segmentI purchased at 12699 rs and i have not got any problem. camera quality is awesome. Before using this i was using mi a3 but mi a3 is not good and also its price is 12999I personally recommend to all my friends if ur budget is balance then u does not need to search any mobile. Simply close ur eyes and bought this

"
"

  Battery although 6000mah however lasts a day only with mild use of internet  that too on a 2G network.Camera not seems 48 MP and blurred images captured if not held steady.Fingerprint  sensor is good.Overall it's ok in this price.

"
"

  You will not get disappointment for next 2.5-3.0 years that's the average life of samsung product.I your uses are low than in such case will may last long .... :)I am happy with buying this product.

"
"

  I bought samsung m21 4GB/64GB variantPros: smart view (Samsung's version of screen cast) - better then the basic screencast, it can play video on TV even if the phone screen is off.Cons: fingerprint and face recognition is slow (compared to realme 5 pro)Camera quality is average (worse then realme 5 pro), image has too much noise in low light.

"
"

  ¬†Awesome experience ,fingerprint reader is quick enough, battery life in normal use work upto 2 and a half days,camera quality is best  in this segment

"
"

  I purchased Samsung galaxy M21 mobile I like this mobile because in this price Samsung gives best features with long life 6000MAH battery with good camera features and big display which gives best experience to playing and watch videos also in this more functions are available compare to other mobile. I like this mobile in this mobile no heating problem coming from me.

"
"

  Please dont buy this phone, With in one month it started restarting. I am not even using more than 5 apps, not even playing games, watching movies still its working very slow and restarting. useless phone west of money. now i have to invest my time to get it repaired or replaced.If you have that much extra time then go for it.

"
"

  The camera is not upto the mark, battery takes long to get charged (if you are looking for fast charging, then this phone it is not for you). However battery backup is pretty good and works for more than 2 days. If you want to buy non-Chinese phone,than this is best under 15000 rupees...üôÇüôÇ

"
"

  The phone is awesome UI looks great silky and buttery smooth,camera is decent,Battlery life is one of the best so far,Display quality is briliant.better than realme 6 and redmi note 9 pro,super quality super amoled sreen

"
"

  Got delivered on 6th aug., barely 1 month before. The sound system is totally defective. Sound of incoming volume is minimal, even after putting speaker on. The models appears in built problems.

  Awesome displayGood sound quality with dolby atmosGood weight management with 6000mah batteryCamera quality is goodBattery is a kingBut charging very slow even it's providing 15w fast charge.Mobile is very handyAuto brightness not upto the markSamsung not provided TPU case and headphone.

This phone is best in this price  segment.Thank you smasung

"
"

  Really bad name on SamsungCamera is not at all good. Getting yellow shade on the top of the photo every time.Connectivity of wifi takes a long time.Disconnecting a call takes at least two taps (seriously....?)I am disappointed with this product.The only great about this product is that the battery life is really good.

"
"

  After 5 days of use, phone display damaged. Thankfully Samsung service centre replace the phone. Bad experience this time with Amazon and specially this phone.

"
"

  Fabulous. It just ok. I satisfied. Battery stands uptown one and half day  if I used with data pack minimally. volume below 50 % sound is very low. .  Battery  little heat when mob data + tethering on, and No game I didn't  installed yet so I couldn't  sure to say about  battery  life when I play game. Overall ok. But though need to do test again uptown few moredays

"
"

  I'm using 4/64GB version. Blue color is better than it seems in the photos. Overall phone seems good for general use.Display is awesome. Call quality is good. Camera is ok.But battery does not at all seems like 6000mAh. It drains like 3500mAh. And phone also has minor framedrop issues. Especially while using 2-3 apps simultaneously.

"
"

  The camera is outstanding , the picture quality is Amazing you will feel the real definition of a genuine camera , mobile is handy. Battery is supremely good with a backup  of 1 and half day. Fingerprint is flexible smooth response is very quick, It is a budget efficient and customer satisfactory phone.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor doesn't respond well. Most of the times i have to unlock my phone with pattern. Also its light sensor does not work well. When i move from dark place to sunlight its brightness does not increase automatically.Not happy with the hardware.I was using MIA1 earlier but that phone never had these problems.

"
"

  Excellent mobile , price wise I feel little costly compared with other mobiles with the better features. But still it goes with the quality and brand

"

  Good product to buy under this price tag along with lot of Advance features...I recommend this product after my 1month of use. It works great in all parameters.

  I dont use my phone for gaming, just extensive use throughout the day with surfing and binge watching on net series being the pro-priority usage.Im in love with the display and colors, having used phones from other brands in the similar price range, this is the best I have had so far! Phone is responsive and meets my needs :D

"
"

  Good product. Everything is good as expected from Samsung. Camera is of best quality among the current lot of smartphones in the market. Initially the battery was a little bit on the lower side but it has improved with time. The phone is way better than phones of other players like MI and Vivo in the same price range.

"
"

  This is one of the finest phone in this price range. You can buy this phone for camera and the processor. This phone's camera is a "" beast "" in its class. You will never feel guilty after buying this phone.Samsung is Samsung ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç

  After a Month use of M21, this is my review üëáWattaBattery : Even after longer browsing hours, there is no need to check battery percentage, Battery of this gadget is really superb!Great Display & Camera is simply excellent!Looks like a premium mobile for 13k.... Go for it !

  It is really a nice phone for those who wants to make lot of calls and watch youtube/movies as it has a very large battery.Camera Quality is very good. It captures good amount of details.The thing I liked is the UI, it has a clean and easy to use UI.Overall it is good phone to buy at this range considering above mentioned points.

"
"

  This product is amazing but the piece I got was physically damaged. The side taping of screen was shattered and scratched. I am completely disappointed by amazon services for such mistakes and ignorance. The company need to focus on such issues.

"
"

  Phone is good in overall performance but it's display is not that strong since my phone'so display breaks down just after 40 days as it falls down from the hieght of only 5 feet and customer service centre asked for the RS.5500/- to replace the display with new one which is 1000 costlier in comparison to M30S display

"
"

  I will give true review.I use it 1 month experience is good not excellent.Space got fulled under 10 day after deleting android>data files it back to normal.charging should be good.Battery hot drain in 8 hours after 2 hours gameplay of pubg mobile lite and game becomes choppy under 4-5 games.Camera is excellent.good phone.

"
"

  After a call the youtube video sound decreases and google meet shows you are on a call. I have to restart the phone every time i want to use YouTube or google meet. Please resolve the problem or else i have to return the product.

"
"

  At least you should give a cover with phone cant you provide a cover with this phone I am highly disappointed with you .And their is no screen recorder on this phone like seriously their is one recorder but it is for game purpose only if I had brought mi phone it would be better for me.i want a cover now send me immediately.

"
"

  I bought it form my Mom. She is occasional youtube watcher and learner. The battery lasts for around 2 days in normal use. The camera is very good for video calling and still photographs in stable and light environment.The phone did not hang as of yet. But heats up when in continuous use. Samsung should have included a clear case with the phone.

"
"

  A decent phone at the 14k price range. The processor is the same old Exynos 9611. Don't expect much from it.Camera clicks good pictures, but still could have been better.One UI has changed Samsung phones drastically and the experience is much better now.I had high expectations from the battery, but it has disappointed me a bit.

"
"

  Not to the Expected Level, i trusted samsung because of i used Samsung Galaxy on5 for 4 years, this time they backstabbed , on5 has better camera quality and Image pixel quality than m21, fingerprint sensor fails in moisty area when you are direct under AC , battery seems good , if you come for camera go for pixel or dslr not into mobile cameras

"
"

  Serve the purpose efficiently very smooth, look is good but not appealing due to the plastic back,display is super, rear & front camera is quite good as claimed by SAMSUNG, fingerprint scanner and face recognition initially takes time for setup then iPhone, overall my experience with the mobile is superb.

"
"

  I bought one samsung galaxy M21 from Amazon in August.I must say its worth every penny.I was looking for a sleek,light weight ,good battery  life and camera phone and I am satisfied  with the the M21.I have attached  2 pics taken from my M21 phone.

"
"

  Good mobile and battery life to goodCamera quality is goodBut delivery person behaviour is worstPlease add daelivery person ratings

"
"

  Am so happieee to buy this model m21. I have spent 6 months which one is I buy.. suddenly my friends colleagues r refer to samsung. But I selected this one. Camera quality is very best to compare other brands even Redmi and oppo. M21 battery life also too good and setting also handled very easily. Totally am happiee to bought Samsung m21. Thanks

"
"

  Pros:In term of s amoled screen,6000 mah battery and camera there is no compatitor in the market. Processor does it job greatly ...smooth day to day taskCons;Polycarbonate back, gets scratches very easilyA good back cover neededAnd yes 15w slow charging easily take 2:30 haurs for 100% charge...but once you charge it last for 2 days

"
"

  Average camera quality not meets the high quality performance.While comparing old product M20 is better camera and display than M21.Cheap and not meets best instead of tell cheap product average quality used for moderate use not for high performance usage.

"
"

  Phone is osm üëåüëåüëå.i like the battery life of the phone mostly .and then camera .There is much more features in this phoneSuch as there is more option of split screen or pop off screen , and screen quality is very good as in all Samsung mobile .But only one thing i dislike but its ok after purchesing  mobile is that charger is of only 15Whatt.

"
"

  Product is very good for normal social media and multimedia uses.. Very good battery backup.. Display quality is very good..but gaming  performance is not good... Pubg lags very much.. This phone is not for heavy gaming... Battery is efficient while playing games it last loner...rather than gaming performance of this phone is very good... I like it..

"
"

  Lovely phone with excellent screen and camera - Battery is just awesome. Must buy product for the beginners. But Amazon delivery is just worst in compare to others. Next day delivery commitment not full filed though i am prime member - i have to call 4 times to get it deliver - and it is happening 2nd time with me -

"
"

  Dont buy this phone. Netwrk gettng discnncted in evry 5 or 10 mins.. lot of netwrk issue... calls getting dropped.  Befr that i ws using samsung j7 n had no issues. Fed up with this m21. Samsung se yeh excpctd nhi tha. Bttry drains so fast. Naam ki 6000 mah hai. Audio quality is loud but not clear.. camera is fine..

"
"

  Best phone in this price segment. My rating is 5/5. There are lots of features in this phone. All things are great. Like, its processor, display, camera, sound quality, battery back up, etc. All things are great. Samsung UI is too good and simple. Touch screen is very sensitive. In short best experience after buying this phone.

"
"

  Touch and processing speed are very awesome.Display quality is very good at this price.Battery backup is extraordinary.Storage and ram are worth.Camera is better and original at day lightCons:Back panel is plastic prone to scratchFingprint sensor should have been better.Camera quality is less good at low light.

"
"

  Samsung made a good product that worth the money. Design is really good,battery life is surprising, RAM and  internal memory is good, graphics is good, more features are included in M21.bt in case of camera it shows 48mp but image doesn't has that much quality. And samsung says its a fast charging model bt its an absolute lie.

"
"

  Edited review after using for 4 days. Many problems facing-1. Typing msg and suddenly stop. Need to lock and unlock then able to type again.2. Internet issue. Connection is good but dont know why messages also unable to send. Flight mode off on, then ok.3. Battery was unable to charge. Restarted mobile and again resume charging.4. Camera is good. So two star.

"
"

  This phone is really value for money. Just buy it and have fun. Pub g works very nicely. No lags nothing. So premium phone if you purchase Black color.

"
"

  Amazing budget phone from samsung and amazing delivery by amazon. I bought this for my mother and the diff is clear. Network connectivity compared to other brands is far far better. Able to call seamless even with one bar in cellular network. Earlier phones showed 4 bars but call nver got connected. Go for it.

"
"

  The phone got damaged in less than a months time. However it was beyond the return date. First the lcd screen got damaged spontaneously.  It had to be replaced after paying a hefty price since it is not covered in warranty.  Within 2 days of replacement the entire phone shut down and became non functional.  I am sure a damaged product was sent.

"
"

  Nice phone...But Auto brightness on always time when you unlock your mobile then after reduce automatically.Battery life is more impressed.Camera quality is very nice.

"
"

  Midnight blue colour, 6000 MAH battery, 48 megapixel good quality camera, 6.4 inches full HD amoled screen, selfie camera 20 megapixel good quality, back fingerprint sensor, smooth edges of the phone, with type c charging port and audio jack and large sound speakers, injust 15999/-go for it affordable.

"
"

  1.Battry performance is not according to the given capacity but can run full day without charging2. Camera performence is good in light but low light performence of camera is avarage while as the front camera performence is vry good3. User interface and display quality is awesome4. Lack of Some usfull features, like app lock , data speedomeater

"
"

  It's totally a garbage..battery reducing fastly.and charging time is 24hours..camera quality very poor..Amazon gave me second hand item and now I could not connect to Amazon technician..I called again and again to Amazon but they didn't receive my call

"
"

  Dislike about this phone is to get fully charged about two hours and fifteen minutes we have to wait.  Since it comes with 6000mah battery, Samsung might have provided with 50 watts fast charger.

"
"

  A class Indian product, absolutely worth it in every aspect - be it display, touch sensing, battery, camera, process, RAM, internal memory and ease of guided use - everything is fantastic. Kudos to Team Samsung to introduce such an affordable yet fabulous mobile for Indians, and special thanks to Team Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  1. Battery life is excellent. 2. Phone UI is well optimized.2.camera quality in the low light mode is good not excellent.3. i am not a game lover so I am not doing the game part of this mobile I only do Asphalt 8 and Subway surfers and a run smoothly. Fingerprint and face lock are very good.face unlock recognise the face even in very low light condition.

"
"

  Good phone in best price,I was looking for a phone with decent space and good battery.This phone covers all aspects including space,  style , battery and camera. Honestly there are very less phones in the market which is not Chinese in make.

"
"

  M21 is best in all the areas accept processor,I mean that you does not play large games and  apps but for daily usage it is awesome.Camera is very good both front and back.Battery is powerful but not as much I expect.Fingerprint sensor,face unlock are very fast.Inbuilt apps are very useful.It is the best phone by samsung in 14000 range.

"
"

  Want to buy mobile then i suggest you to buy this one.be'z Samsung is always best rather than Redmi ,Realme ,vivo,oppo....This are chinese brands and not long lasting.But samsung is Strong & best option for you.And specially its Cameras are AwesomeAnd Fingerprint & other specifications are just Amazing.Must Buy product.

  Just awesome phone in such price battery life is awesome. Pubg game can be played with balanced graphics. Else full charge mobile can be used for 2 days. My dad is using this mobile. He use to see youtUbe. listening music on spotify. Whatsapp. And the battery consumption is excellent

"
"

  Awesome phone within budgetGreat battery life,allows easy multitasking,allows versatile photography, extremely user friendly Go for it.

"
"

  Device is all good, but it is heating very much even without use.

"
"

  Finger print reader is quite impressive. Also don't forget that the battery life is amazing. The first and best phone I've ever purchased from amazon. Don't wait for the second thought  go for it if you are looking for something affordable at lower price with a good camera quality and battery life.  I've made a right Choice buying this product.

"
"

  Good phone specialy for mom's with a great camera and performance..

"
"

  I have been using this handset from past 5months. I just bought this hand set because of amoled screen display. Phone music volume is not good in speaker. Phone camera is good. Battery backup is superb.. but charging phone takes hell lot of time.

"
"

  Best phone under this budget. Camera, screen interface  everything  is great. I would suggest  buyers to buy Samsung's  2 years comprehensive  protection  plan through Samsung  care app after buying  this phone. Thanks for wonderful phone Samsung

"
"

  Amazing product from Samsung at this price point. It's a wow factor from all aspects. I'm blown away by the display and battery life.Pictures shot through the camera come out really well. Wish the colours were a little less saturated.It's probably my best phone till date.It would be unfair on Amazon not to thank them for the quick delivery :)

"
"

  Worst phone . Got heated up even after 5 mins of charging . Wants to return it . But customer care executive forced to download the smart check app . That app is totally worthless . Selling forcefully their cheap products and even not returning them . Money wasted . Will not shop from Amazon again . Worst app . Worst experience

"
"

  Mobile phone box was tear from 1side but phone and accessories were well from inside.. seller should keep in mind before dispatch!!

"
"

  Pathetic customer care service by amason. I have raised the issue about the phone overheating. It's just like iron box when using it. I have raised the complaint before the closing window. After inspection when I contacted to customer care they are telling return window period closed. Really pathetic customer care and irresponsible executive.

"
"

  If u want a non- chinese budget phone with s-amulade display - great camera- great battery then purchase itI'm giving some camera examples which I have taken today .But I want to mention that the pictures are over saturated and the selfies are not so natural(means the skins becomes so clear)... But it will not make u disappointPurchase it ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"
"

  After 2 months useFeatures of battery saver and data saver good. Phone missed option of restrict data app wise. Processors  is damn slow and hang issues.Buy if you are heavy battery user and like AMOLED.

"
"

  1)Camera is just  okay okay....2)And talking about the battery , not so good as they claimed its life is 1.5days.3) It heats a lot when using normal apps like youtube , fb etc4) In 1hr it charged only 30%, which is so badspeed ..Overall my experience is so badI don't except this ,i bought it only because of it battery life

"
"

  The only reason I purchased this phone was because of battery but it turned out to be a great surprise overall package. Much better than all the Chinese smartphones not just in terms of hardware but also software.

"
"

  The Samsung m21 is the best value for money device in the under 15000 segment . The display quality is top notch and is ideal for users who stream a lot of movies and videos.The 6000mAh battery is a big plus and the one ui interface is clean and user friendly.The camera captures  great day light shots  and offers decent low light shots.Night mode in camera works fine as well.

"
"

  Good SmartPhone......Performing Will...But  Speedness Of Smrtphone is Not much Great....as Excepted...+point is Display.....and Battery.......GoodOne Thing Which Irritates me is The Price...From 12600 to 14000....How....and Why....Which is totally not give Good feeling....BUT, over all I am Happy üòÄ.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is a good non-Chinese mobile phone with excellent battery life of approx 2 days. Good experience of indoor photos. Sound quality is excellent.I used Sony Xperia XA1 earlier. As compared to Sony Xperia XA1, Samsung M21 is bulkier and can not operate easily with one hand.128GB memory is adequate at given price. Overall good budget phone.

"
"

  Fingrprint sensor is parallel to body. So hard to find. And touch sensitivity is less it takes 2seconds. No notification li8. Battery perfrmnce is superb..Handy one. Processor is good. No quality of 6gb RAM.

"
"

  I am disappointed,Samsung product is not bad but their service is very very poor. I purchased  M 21 August 4 after one  and half month charger is not working. I contact customer care they instructed to me visit samsung care. I informed my product issue but they cannnot  respond  after two week.

"
"

  It never let me realise tha i am using a new phone it has everything which my old phone has it hangs its camera became blur suddenly . Oh god i wish i choose better

"
"

  There is a scratch on upper side of mobile phone and fingerprint is not working properly like i set the fingerprint lock but unable to unlock that camera is quite good but pixels are not clear so i want fresh new phone else refund my money.

"
"

  I recommend for this phone you can buy Samsung Galaxy m21. Good phone for gamers. Huge 6000 mah battery also fast charging. You can take great photos with 48 mp camera and night mode and super slow motion videos and front camera 20mp camera. Latest android 10version. I am playing pubg and freefire without lagging

"
"

  Haven't used it for a long time but looks good as of now. Battery back up is very good. Camera is fantastic and screen resolution is top notch. Excellent mobile for the price range.

"
"

  Its a good product  from Samsung  , Great phone for those who use more social media as it has a super amoled  display , its very crisp produces nice colors , battrey life is good , camera quality  is awesome with ""single take "" recent  update :) , I think  M21 is best phone  in this range , please dont compare  it with poor Chinese  phones .

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 seems one of the best in this budget. The phone is very responsive and there is no perceivable lag. Camera quality is outstanding, both the front and back cameras produce sharp, detailed photographs. Steady cam and slow-motion features are there too.

"
"

  i will never recommend anyone to buy samsung M21that too from amazon. its not even a month since i brought this device and it have started to develop spots on display. even worst experience i with samsung's 1 year warranty the pathetic service centres. NO PARTS AVAILABLE. WHAT A BRIALLANT EXCUSE. seriouly never purchase anything from amazon.

"
"

  Verdict Battery life is great, performance is satisfactory and gets the job done, the display is really good for the price. It even comes with the latest Android operating system which offers meaningful features. However, there's a 'but' and that is the camera.best part of M21 is battery life.thank you Samsung india best job..

"
"

  Great, great phone!!So very happy that I bought it. Has amazing features at such an affordable price. Has Dolby atmos sound, easy file and app transfer features from old features, camera quality and not to mention the RAM and memory (try searching for 6GB/128GB under 16k, you will know the price of other brands üòâ)

"
"

  Touch is poor and key board  lay out also not good ..fully screen, my mobile cracked  within the two days of purchase. Just fall down from divan cott..battery is bellow average ..my previous mobile was 5000mh , its performance is so better then this phone..Even camera also just average..

"
"

  The phone is actually a beast in its performance...with a whole day long lasting battery...this device keeps me entertained  and security is also powered with the Samsung Knox security with pre installed McAfee security....Face unlock also works good and no lags too....moreover the user interface is very good and smooth to use...I'm in love with this device.

"
"

  I will recommend this phone to all those who want it for office use i.e. calling , hotspot , images etc.But if you want a mobile for gaming I won't recommend this phone to you.1 star I have deducted for heating issue and plastic back scratch issue.And reasons to recommend this mobile1. Screen2. Battery

"
"

  Battery performance is awesome ,3 days stand up battery life , camera quality is best in good quality of lighting ,selfie cam gives 20 mp better quality ,storage and ram performance is good and fast ,more promising product of samsung with good and best android 10 processor with rate below 15000 , the most attractive feature is display ,I loved itü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©

"
"

  Battery 6000 amp still dosent last long.There is big problem with Antena which results in weak network signal. Rest everything is nice. Display is mind blowing.

"
"

  The phone is awesome. I mean you can't get better than this in this price range. I have fairly used  it then I am writing the review..When you'll put sim then the phone wil heat a little bit..after some time. It will become normal. Battery is good enough.. cammera quality is merely good. Look is awesome..Overall value for money..

"
"

  Very good quality phone and a great alternative to Chinese products. Camera is good for it's price  bracket.the only thing I felt was the battery a 6000 mah battery dosent last how it should be as compared to  their own m30s battery. So gave it one star less. But just let me add the battery lasts whole day on full multimedia use 12hrs of Netflix

"
"

  Touch is not sensitive as Samsung showcase in there advertise. Overall i loved battery life. Camera quality is fare not as they posted on official blog and website. I could say value for money if they would focus more on touch.

"
"

  It's an amazing phone and my experience with it is just loving. The fingerprint reader is absolutely correct and fantastic it's read within very short time and make system fast. The battery is awesome 6000mAh last long and works efficiently. Camera quality is also nice makes me more attractive towards photography. In short I like this phone

"
"

  1. Being 6000 mah it doesn't last a day, need charge twice.2. Fingerprint reader somtimes doesn't work.3. Camera is moderate regarding its clarity as most results for example couldn't track pimples on face clearly, somewhat blury.3. Its a descent processor bit slow such as touch sensing, lags in opening and closing apps.

"
"

  This Samsung galaxy M21 has some amazing features in this price segment whether being its 'big battery or super amoled everything seems quite perfect but still camera and design will definitely disappoint u

"
"

  The smartphone performance is good overall. The pictures from rear camera turns out to be really good with features like ultra wide shots and scene optimizer. Regarding battery life , for a medium to heavy usage the phone will sail you easily through more than a day. The finger print reader and face lock works well everytime.

"
"

  I personally am a Nokia & Motorola lover...but this mighty Samsung m21 is really a good pick...this is my first ever Samsung set which I have used in my life...but, i must say, it's a brilliant phone with massive battery life and a far beyond impressive camera with 48 mega pixel resolution, comfortable to hold, type & surf...

"
"

  I am writing this review after 2 days of usage of Samsung Galaxy M21.. As per my first impression it it is a value for money product.. Great battery life.. Nice camera features also.. Finger print authentication  is fast.. But face recognition takes a little more time.. I think it is a better phone in this budget.. I got it for 15K.. 6GB RAM.. 128 GB Memory..

"
"

  1st time I used samsung Android phone. But this is worst experienced I ever had.Samsung demand, they provide 6000 mah battery but it's life compare to low 4000 mah battery. Worst camera and finger print sensor..Camera quality as per low quality whatever samsung demand.Finger print is not fast.. Compare to mi note 7 pro..Overall not a good experience..

"
"

  I can unlock this mobile using anyone's face, it isn't face lock, can Samsung please change the name of face lock into just a screen lock, what is the logic in face lock when I could unlock with anyone's face.Amazon kindly add face lock as a feature to rate mobiles.

"
"

  What a phone! What a display! This the best phone for non gamers. Hands down. Samsung is on a roll and has a true winner on hand. I really thank samsung for launching products like these of high quality at low costs for us Indians. Really happy.

  Battery-9/10(8hrs of all  continuous usage)CameraFront-9/10Back-6/10(48mp not upto the mark)Voice calls-10/10Consuming 15gb for only system apps Finally satisfied with that priceExcept camera all are superb

"
"

  I bought m21 in last month.I am very glad to use this phone..The major feature 9f M21 is the AMOLED screen.We can't compare with other phones in about screen.We can easily handle the phone.The Dolby effect is awesome when we see movies...I bought the phone in 15000 rupees.Now the price increased...

"
"

  I  have purchased  Samsung phone fist time my experience  is not pleasant1. Unwanted long screen,no pocket  freindly2. Slow internet speed compare to realme3. No fast charging4. Good things  are sreen and camera ,5. Processor  is average

"
"

  M21 .... Fingerprint and face unlock very slow .. battery ok .  15w fast charger is fake . Very very slow charging.. camera not satisfied with clarity and options ... Mistakenly i bought this with appearance... Very slow processor...samsung midrange phones  r always wrost ..

"
"

  Super set i m already using m20 and it will continue giving well performance as per battery scenario or other things like touch and camera..therefore i decide to purchase new m21 for ma wife now 1 month complete overall operations are going well...samsung always provide values for money as per standards...happy to purchase samsungs products

"
"

  I hv been using this mobile since last 6 days and believe me guys its owsm device....Display,battery life,cameras,daliy performance jst wow as i am not a gamer so can't  tell about that but for media consumption its fabulous.....and even i didn't  face any network  issue as i lives in Jaipur and network  is fine here....so u cn grab this owsm device....

"
"

  I got software issue in the phone. Low voice problem, lnternal Storage is showing full even if there is nothing available in the phone. Damn! I‚Äôm gonna change the software to get a better performance. One thing is that this issues has been identified after 10 days of using. So I could not ask for a replacement via amazon as I was late for the replacement date.

"
"

  The monster has a long lasting battery. It can easily last for more than a day when used extensively!! Some people might find the fingerprint sensor a little higher for comfort but it works smoothly.Camera is pretty good for this price and captures masterpieces in daylight.Phone has super amoled display and all applications run smooth with 6gb ram.

"
"

  Very best in below 15k range

"
"

  Battery , screen display & camera are the main player , I just have doubt on volume and unlock button because they're feelings looseOtherwise it is good choice for moderate user ...In this lockdown there are plenty option but I choose this &I'm satisfied with #MonsterWell comeback by #Samsung in midrange budget phones

"
"

  Under non chinese brand, M21 is the best budget phone. Have been using this phone for a month now, battery stays for solid 1.5 days even though I surf the internet continuously and make VoIP calls for 2 hours daily. Bouquet effect is nice and apps are loading pretty fast. Yet to try PUBg.

"
"

  Overall experience is very good,  have no complaints regarding anything except a bit lengthy changing time and performance of fingerprint reader can't be called as excellent. Camera quality is really awesome at this price range, the camera has document scanning ability also. Picture quality is really very good.

"
"

  I have been testing for couple of days rn and the performance  is really good.I have tested a few gamesFortnite-30fpsCod-60 fps lockPubg-bannedThe battery life is really good like after 17 hours of gaming the battery was only 27 drained out of 100 so a plus point and the display is awesome

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy m21 is really the best mid budget phone as it is packed with an awesome 6000mah battery, 48 megapixel triple rear camera that is really very good and it has super amoled display which gives great viewing experience.The only thing that is wrong with this phone is the charging speed. It should be more than what is given.

"
"

  Excellent phone and  decent specifications at this rate. Battery life is so good and charging time is decent.Display is good.Overall experience is good.Must be best at this range..Samsung is doing way better.All the best to replace every Chinese phones in the market

"
"

  Battery backup is not good in this phone as par 6000 mah battery it's look like 3500 or 3800 mah battery is inside it's battery power reduce fast. I don't know what the problem. Overall phone is good all the features are good but battery is not worthy ‚òπÔ∏è.

"
"

  Let's talk about this Device1. Fingerprints are best ( thanks to physical  fingerprints  )2. Display are vivid  and smooth3. Battery  are great in specs but not happy with  performance  ( can be fixed through update )4 . Camera  are very good  in daylight but in low light things are different5. Performance  are quite  good

"
"

  The screen ,display, the quality of sound and noise filtering works splendid. The camera features and resolution is also praise worthy. A long lasting battery of 6000mAh. I think it's a really good phone for the price at which it comes. Coming to aesthetics, it sits perfectly in your hands and looks suave with a triple camera adding to its enticing beauty.

"
"

  Very good phone. I bought Samsung particularly  bcos I didn't want to buy any Chinese phones. This is my first step towards boycotting  Chinese products.Coming  to the phone  Display is awesome, Software is on the lighter  side making it snappy, camera  could  have been better but Samsung  has managed to give a good quality  phone at this price

"
"

  It's just been 15 days i bought it and i m facing problem with this phone. I am unable to charge the phone.. it's not a problem with the charger , i have checked the same charger on different phone it's working fine.. so the problem is in the phone..the phone automatically turned of as it can't take charge.. i don't know what to do now..?

"
"

  Battery life is goodDisplay is goodFingerprint sensor averageCamera quality good in day time but pic become noisy in low lightOverall good for a normal user who only who want to view videos , surf internetAt this price of 13999

"
"

  I don't know how it will work but the phone wasn't in original cover covered box was also old type. Wen I charged it was like 50 % already . Still need to check the phone

"
"

  Awesome touch, camera is too good with focus, battery is as expected.Charger should have been if more power according to the mah of battery.

"
"

  the most buget powerfull battery 6000mah...both camera are amazing ... look wise amazing its look different from other device U shaped notch which makes difference and take great experience .  the most important display is reallly amazing superamoled display ... it'S makes really like monster .... it is most buget powerful a monster mobile ..... which i like most...

"
"

  Very good one for a normal user. Battery charge lasts for two days. Music player app wasn't installed and I had to install it from play store. This disappointed me since I'm a music lover. And there must be an option for include headsets for those who needs .

"
"

  I have been using this phone for about 10 days...The phone is cool, it has huge 6000mah battery..but disappointed by charging speed it only supports Samsung's 15watt fast charger. This phone is for people who charge their phone overnight. Camera quality is awesome with its 48mp main cam. I am a fan of it's super amoled display..overall the phone is a monster

"
"

  I disappointed, within a couple of weeks touch not working, and I give to service, their told its in screw thread out, that's mean it's body opened mobile, within month i face these kind of issues, so I totally disappointed with this product, Amazon is responsible for this.

"
"

  Amazing Display, Smooth Touch, Features are great.. Glad to buy SAMSUNG M21. I don't play games much.. I didn't get any lag in the phone. It's going Smooth. Camera looks great but not the best but overall, you get what you pay, I'm happy with my purchase of the phone.  Samsung is at least.. better than Chinese ones. Thanks!

"
"

  PROSScreenBatteryCamera is good for the pricePerformance is good for everyday useCONSPre loaded samsung apps can be removed

"
"

  Great display, really great battery life, great camera, light weight phone in segment. Great UI.too many customize available.Cons - finger print sensor not working properly,too many times it's not working. It's Not for pubg lovers. Too Many frame drops. Lagi game.This phone Not for gamers.Don't buy who want play pubg in this phone.

"
"

  I am giving the review after 1month of using....1) Camera is Average but not bad2) Battery stability not like 6000mah its just work as 3000mah (main minus point) compared to my old mobile3) For gaming purpose not upto mark like PUBG , COD (some lag and loading issues)4) Sometimes i experienced heating problems also

"
"

  Superb mobile for this cost. I love it. Touch is super soft. Camera quality is really nice. 1st Pic attached is taken without light and used flash light alone. Next pic without light n flash ligth too in a dark room.

"
"

  Great product in this budget.Also I feel happy to buy an Indian product.Battery life is the most attractive  feature  for me . Fingerprint  scanner  is also good working. Camera have a problem  in bright light,but it's ok. Selfie  camera  is also good.I suggest  this one for the People  who  are looking for an indian product  under 15000

"
"

  Overall quality is good. Camera is not fully tested but the images taken looks good. Finger print seems to be not working everytime. Battery life is 1 day for full usage browsing continuous calling, movie etc.. only thing was missing was not include any accessory inside except charger

"
"

  This phone has a major problem to be taken care of. The WiFi abruptly stops working it shows connected but no internet. I've tried all the methods for it and it doesn't work. May be this is a hardware issue don't buy this phone

"
"

  One of the best phones in the price range.Key points are:1. Screen2. Camera3. BatteryI use the phone all the time for work and for playing games and I can do it all day without needing to charge.The camera and the AI features are also really great. Especially the night camera.

"
"

  Simply awesome phoneThe battery life is excellentThe amoled display is very vivid and blacks r very deep best in this classCamera is decent and the outdoor bright light shots are very good

"
"

  Mobile is pretty good with nice camera quality and with more than one day battery back up but by looking at 6000 mah I expected 2 days battery back upAt this price remaining all features are very good,worth buyingCons.Wifi calling option automatically getting disabled after sometime and call recording is not working when connected to wifi

"
"

  Thanks to Amazon for this fabulous phone which was delivered on time. I have ordered this phone because my friend has been using this phone. Whenever he turns on the screen, it attracted me to watch the screen. Thanks to Samsung for an amazing display in a medium range price. Loved the phone. Just go for it.

"
"

  I gifted this phone to my sister! Phone quality is not good.I even don‚Äôt know whether phone is original or not.Phone is already at Service centre.They are taking too much time for service.It seems purchase of electronics good from Amazon is not a trustworthy.,Very disappointing,I faced similar problem with my iPhone purchased from Amazon

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is a super current age phone. It meets all the features of a mid range premium phone. Camera is good, battery life is worth every penny you have spent, sound quality is good and speed is quite good. But the portrait mode in the camera is not upto the mark.Overall it's a has a great user friendly experience.

"
"

  The best mid-range phone in my opinion. The fingerprint sensor is very accurate and fast. The camera is superb, especially the wide angle mode is just amazing. Has no problem running heavy games. The fast charging reduces charging time drastically. The only downpoint was that the OTG adapter is not included with the phone.

"
"

  Best mobile and I  bought this mobile for watching movies I used to watch 4K and bluray movies no words just awesome and love to watch ,Battery is really great after watching full resolution 4K movies of 5gp more than 4 still works great and I recommend this mobile without any issues after using 15 days writing this review

"
"

  20 days after delivery it started showing BSOD(Black screen of Death). I tried several times to restart but didn't work. Then I somehow managed to start it again and went back to the same thing. I kept on trying and the next time it turned on I did a factory reset but after 3 days went back to the same thing.

"
"

  Worst phone I ever bought. Very slow.....not a single game installed but still very slow. Started Hanging..... didn't completed one month yet. Mobile also not charging with other charger. Not a good phone for journey. I expected from Samsung.

"
"

  Best phone .. working very nicely ,the best part of the phone is its camera and display . Just want to thanks Amazon as this is my first phone which I bought online ..and it fulfills my expectations so from my side 10/10 for this phone ...just go for it without any second thought or doubt in mind.Thankyou

"
"

  This is an awesome  device with lots of in built features to discover. Display, battery life and camera quality are the top three qualities. Swift with face and fingerprint unlock. Must buy. If you need even high performance, go to next varient the SAMSUNG Galaxy M31 6G RAM.

"
"

  At first I was confused on buying this product. But after buying I was happy about it. Display is very nice. I'm a moderate user, the battery life last the whole day. I started using the phone with 80% at 10 am. By 9 pm the battery  was 30%.I have been using it for more than a month. Hope you find it useful

"
"

  Really ""What A Monster"" from Samsung. Best phone from Samsung in 14999. 6gb ram makes it a super phone and 128gb storage gives us a lot of space to download and save big games and movies.The processor is also good.  The camera quality is very nice.The finger print sensor is also fast and battery is like a powerhouse lot of backup. The phone is very good just go and buy it.

"
"

  The phone is awesome, easy to handle and use, The fingerprint reader is fast than the other mobile I used so far, battery life is so good and can use more time in a single charge, camera quality is awesome and has a out put of wonderful resolution and quality, More over the phone users will use the word often is ""Oh yaa!!! The phone is mind blowing"".

"
"

  Poor Camera quality compared to 13MP other phone,  Please don't buy if you really a cam lover. Other Features are SatisfactoryFault with M21 is Only camera and its qualityAfter Buying I am now Helpless, atleast I could with this review For others who have a look at this Samsung galaxy m21 model...

"
"

  In just 25 days the screen start fadding . Samsung service station given token and told on 27th august we will check your phone. No support online also. Pathetic after sales service. The replacement period should be of 30 days. They are selling poor quality phones. I want refund or replacement.

"
"

  Looks is awesome , battery is mind blowing after continuous usages it is drained about 15 to 20 hour playing some pubg, surfing and vedio calling.I recommended must buy this product and it's feel u happy.Camera-9/10Battery-10/10Screen-10/10Looks -8/10Fingerprint reader-9/10

"
"

  Fast unlock with face and fingerprint. Awesome screen and whooping battery just charging time is slow despite providing 15W adaptive fast charging(in-box). All the goodness comes with samsung brand trust and a real made in india smartphone. Mine is August 2020 made. Very nice camera.

"
"

  Great phone for the price. Mainly using for watching videos  and clicking  pictures. And boy o boy the amoled screen and the camera are superb. The best in this price range. The fingerprintworks smoothly too. The large battery gets me through 2 days with moderate usage and the 15w fast charging tops the battery up from 20 to 100 in about an hour.

"
"

  This is the best camera quality phone under this bujjet range.I am so happy to buy this.. But, in this range other phones have better performance, but if we compare with camera, this phone is far better...And the display is so rich quality...The multimedia experience in this phone is so good...

"
"

  Never buy this product, within 15 days the phone stops working , I took it to the service centre, within half an hour they said there is some problem with the phone you will get full refund within 15 days . Upon lot of enquires they said total M series phone are defective

"
"

  Do not buy super faulty phone not getting initialized.  Customer care putting calls on hold for too long when connected telling  to download  blanco app which is not possible as google account  login required  for  play store is not getting logged in while same google account  is working good in another mobileNetwork  also not getting  selected

"
"

  Best of the non Chinese phone at this price range..Pros: good camera result, big screen, no issue hangs or lagging unlike older Samsung phones, trust of SamsungCons: battery life is good but not as good as a 6000 mah batteryYou can buy it and if you can spend some bucks more, go for m31..

"
"

  Very much frustrated from a brand like Samsung. After one month of use,  first mobiles touch screen gone out of work and after that whole screen got blurred and blakish....now don't known whether Samsung replaced it or repair it...but my trust gone from Samsung brand.... worst product so far...

"
"

  This phone is really a value for money, amazing battery life ,good performance. This phone does not have the typical problem that samsung phones in this price range had of hanging and slow processing. Fingerprint sensor senstivity has been quitely improved. And ofcourse samsung phones are durable. So overall its wonderful phone in this price range.

"
"

  Build quality is good, but doesn't look like a Samsung phone,look like cheap Chinese phone,Camera quality is worst, finger print sensor is very small, totally disappointed with Samsung

"
"

  Wanted to replace the item as the screen is having small spot on screen. Now return window is over. Customer service  did not call me within given time and so the return window got expired on 27th july. The same product is unavailable so replacing it is also not the option.What to do in this case? Dont want to keep defective piece.

"
"

  a monster with a huge battery and samoled display in such a low price range....great performance....slight utterness but not that much....a macro lens wouldve sufficed but not a problem at all for closeup shots with the normal rear camera...........overall a great product to buy in my opinion:)

  Guys it's a true comment I bought this mobile 15 days back n now it is giving lots of trouble...Camera quality is so bad n it's getting hang also...call quality is so badIt is totally waste of money don't but this mobile

"
"

  Everything in this mobile works very well. The only downside is the processor. Tho for gaming it gives a very decent experience but ROM is a bit slow. But that's not at all an issue. If you are looking for mobile phone with a great display,sound, and easy ui interface . Go for this . I have 6GB 128 variant.

"
"

  fingerprint reader is not so good when phone is in locked mode..many times it doesn't read finger and then i have to click the lock button then fingerprint starts work..phone hangs in game mode..battery life is only good (cause 6000mah behaves like 5000mah battery) and camera is good..overall i m not satisfy with this phone in this range..

"
"

  In one word this would definitely called as an ""HD Monster"" the screen quality is the best one. Coming to camera, the front was little disappointing, thought it would give an amazing pic but the back camera was awesome. Overall when camera kept aside this is the best mobile ever with cheap price üëå

"
"

  Poor products , recomending not to buy this. It started hanging on the third day from the date i recieved this phone. Moreover its fingerprints  doesnot works well. Also its gets heated wven on short duration calls

"
"

  THIS PHONE IS OF NO USE it lags too muchIt's like u open an app and wait for like minutes so that the app starts.Go for mi mobile instead this one.I had mi 7 pro exchanged it for this Samsung m21 as to have an upgraded mobile.But now it feels like the mi mobile was way better than this .

"
"

  One of the best pieces launched by Samsung , it has great features with extremely best experience...I bought it on 22 July and in 1 month it had gived me all the features I wanted...but due to front camera low brightness selfie had forced me to give 4 stars out of 5...it is best mobile for all who are not interested in gaming...

"
"

  I have purchase on 06th August this phone and within 1 month phone touch automatically working I submit to samsung care on 15th sep and get today but still problem is same very bad experience after purchasing 16k phone then also not get reply properly also one time send msg to Amazon for call this order but still time no call received

"
"

  Dont buy any samsung product. Samsung was finisd. Samsung product was very fragil. After 1 month used display was automaticaly blind and no responce in costomer care. They asking money 5500 to repair in guaranty period. The samsung display was very critical and lackadaisical . Go to other compani product they was lick a stone product.

"
"

  The phone  gets automatic  switched off in few seconds of sleep mode and while using also. The battery is charged. It is not switching on by pressing power key unless you connect charge than press power key. I bought this phone on 18th July 2020 and facing this problem from 10th Aug 2020. I have tried restore factory setting but nothing is changed.

"
"

  Each quality about this one is better than other's. Comparing form other Chinese products its superb. Regarding performance display is fabulous, battery is as well, camera is incredible but yeh like other's processor it's a little bit less but don't worry if you're not a hard gamer than the phone will gives you unbelievable power to make you happy.

"
"

  Great product!!!Battery runs for a day on a single charge...Triple camera setup is awesome but I really miss the macro one...Gaming experience  is also good, sometimes  I  noticed minor frame drops on high graphics game like freefire but that's not a big issue..No heating issue...And most important UI is awesome... no ads..

"
"

  A good quality product with handsome features.Only problem I faced in 1 week usage is that it often heats up after a 1-2 hour continuous usage but not to worry as the heating is not tension worthy.If u r looking for a quality camera and a good screen than its the best.Even better than MI ones.Here I m sharing some photos clicked by M21

"
"

  This product are very bad .charging timing 5:30 minutes in 24%. I am very glade that purchase this product. Amazon also helpless & do not refund money.

"
"

  The M21 phone is amazing with best in class display, hassle free battery life..once charged you are sorted for minimum a day atleast...no bloatware..camera also isvery good...amazing phone with such good features and from a gold standard brand- Samsung that too at such a price point...Always will recommend this mobile..

"
"

  1)Excellent Battery Life2) Excellent Camera Quality-Retains resolution  while enlarging Pictures3) Good Fingerprint sensor

"
"

  The phone is good. It's been a month since I bought it. The phone works well, there are regular software updates. You do get some bloatwares( Netflix, facebook) on the phone, but thats fine.Battery easily lasts for a day with heavy usage.I don't use camera much, so I can't say anything about it.

"
"

  Good display. Avg to Good Camera. Good in terms of performance for everything except Gaming.Doesn‚Äôt hang.Only issue is that the screen guards available in the local markets don‚Äôt cover it properly.Excellent battery backup. Lasts 2 days on light use. 1.5 on moderate use. 1 full day on heavy use.

"
"

  I have a very big doubt in purchasing a budget mobile coz we have lots of various brands and I chose to go for samsung and it doesn't dissappoint me. As it says it's a monster and actually,it is a budget monster so don't get confused trust me and go for samsung and I've been using for a week and what I feel is everything is smooth as samsung promised.

"
"

  I was looking for a non Chinese phone in affordable price and with great features... And this was the best phone... Camera can be more Better but it's fine.

"
"

  I am an artist and create beutiful arts, but my previous mobile phone did not capture the depth of it. Samsung M21 has an iconic camera quality that brings my art to life. I have been getting multiple applauds, all thanks to this new , all- in-one mobile phone.Also, i can now reply to everyone, everyday beacuse of the long-lasting battery life

"
"

  Amazing amoled screen, those who are you tuber and movie lover this phone is best for them. I have compared its amoled screen with MI A3 amoled screen, Samsung m21 has more appealing colors and brightness than mi a3.I am not a gamer so can't judge about game lagging. Camera is good enough.

  Nice medium budget phone with all features. Again Samsung proved as leader in technology and people pulse. I recommending this phone to everyone. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  The device is amazing, it's been almost a month since I'm using it, it charges fast, the battery last long. I charge the device once in 24hrs and attend all my classes ue social media and still the battery is left. Completely in love with it. The camera quality is superb. The audio is good and the face unlock & fingerprint is superb.

"
"

  For mid range budget this is omong one of the best option. In quality  ,variation  in mobile, price range  no one can beat. So  it is best option .

"
"

  Slow face unlock and fingurprint reader.Camera quality is good at day but avrage in night.battery performance is average when network issue.Some time mobile phone hangs. Overall good performance at this price.Screen quality is awesome.There is no LTE only mode. If Audio jack available on upper side then it is best combination.

"
"

  Just Perfect  and works better. Good deal at this price range and a best Budget phone.Battery backup is ultimate, super Amoled screen is superb,camera has very good features.

"
"

  Thumps up for this phone. Best in range of 14 K with best camera battery and screenpurchase the phone without any doubt.

"
"

  Ita truely a monster..  loved the battery life..  the screen is smooth and durable. The camera is crystal clear and there are so many options from fast video to ultra slow motion.  The zoom and depth of the camera are also amzing. All this and more in budget. I would highly recommend this made in india phone to everyone.

"
"

  Monster battery it's real I played pubgmobile in it and a redmi redmi losses 5 to 6 percent of charge in a tdm and this phone don't loss oneCamera is epic for your buck shots are crisp and video 4k 30 fps to 120 fps slow all are very much auesumn. If the price goes down just go for it.

"
"

  The phone has an amazing screen and battery life. The software is fast unlike the previous generations.The camera quality is good and it's nice that Samsung has pre-loaded most of the useful appsOverall a very good budget phone with an extraordinary battery life.

"
"

  Battery backup is good and screen is super.I am using Samsung phone first time as per my previous phone experience Samsung can update the ui more user friendly like call recording on call screen

"
"

  Best phone for the money, if you are a user who uses the phone for social network and internet surfing, this phone is par.. Good phone for daily use person and good audio quality and performance......

"
"

  After buying this phone i recommended my two friends  and they also brought this so total 3 phone of this we are using  and trust me its valuable  in this price battery good camera everything  awesome

"
"

  My first Samsung in years of My Mobiles Usage. Absolutely the best Display and Battery Life for this price range. The camera could have been better as the market has some better options available. Although, VFM!

"
"

  Nice purchase on a budget. Value for Money. Camera Sucks at times, But Since I don't use Camera much, this Phone works awesome for me. Charging wire is very small, Samsung will do cost cutting in such areas, Didn't expect. No earphones. Sad about that part.Fast charging is there.Will give 6/10

"
"

  Writing after using for 15daysCamera 48MP was not a default oneCamera quality is goodBattery 6000Mah pretty goodFinger print sensor a bit slowIn 15 days it keyboard strucked 4times while typing

"
"

  The battery of this phn is totally a monstar, camera is awesme and all other features are so much loveable . I am using a 4, 64 varient and i purchased this phone because appoximately all features which are important are available in this phone in so much friendly bugdet. In end all i can say if you planning to buy a new phone just give it a glance.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is for those who are looking for a smartphone with big battery and do not care about the Chinese competition smartphones from the popular brands like Realme and Xiaomi. Those competitive device perform much better than the M21*  Crisp AMOLED display*  Very good battery life*  Decent performance

"
"

  I have using this phone for a month. I have switched from mi to Samsung and it's a great experience i found some amazing feature such as battery 6000mah and super amoled display. And one thing before buying this phone i was little hesitate about it's  processor and till now i am not finding any problem. Honestly it my best decision to buy this phone

"
"

  I love this phone.The display is very smooth to touch.The camera is so good.The fingerprint is also works super fast.Battery life is too good. If I fill my battery, it long lasts for 1 day for sure.Processing is also too good.Worth for this price. I am sure that if u buy this you won't regret for this.

"
"

  Didn't have that much as aspected apart from battery and screen, 6000 mah battery is tooo much can't complaint about it........ But apart from that it's has nothing...flat.. it's a plastic body ... And that's rain drop down camera look pretty old stuffI didn't like m21 as much..... buy just bcz of non Chinese brand only reason.

"
"

  Please don't buy this.very slow operating,heavy heat at finger print area.camera quality also average.compare to MI some features are missing in this.speaker also some times not working properly.

"
"

  The best smartphone for the price!Display 5/5Battery 5/5Camera 4/5Speaker 5/5Gaming 4/5Value for money 5/5

"
"

  I liked its ""battery life"" (6000 mah is a LOT ) ""amoled screen"" under this price range is rare so I Liked it also what I disliked is exynos processor like Samsung should have given a snapdragon 600 series chip atleast rather than this overheating exynos chip

"
"

  I received this phone about a week back. I am fully satisfied with it. Value for money with amazing battery life and camera, the speaker is also loud and clear and does not hurt your ears. The display is very pleasing. What I love the most is the design of it, very handsome looking smartphone at a very affordable price. Definitely a great buy! Cheers!

"
"

  As advertised, the phone has mammoth battery life, fingerprint sensor is also good but sometimes it becomes essential to open the lock with password as the fingerprint sensor becomes stagnant, camera quality is very good. Overall the phone is great in the range. I prefer samsung phone over other useless Chinese junks.

"
"

  Firstly, Samsung is a brand name which isn‚Äôt Chinese so it‚Äôs already better than Oppo, Vivo, Redmi etc.The battery is monstrous, you‚Äôll need to charge it once in 2 days for normal usage.Camera is brilliant, photos are sharp and clear but 48MP camera is a bit slow.Overall , if your budget is around 15K , you must go for this phone‚úåÔ∏è

"
"

  Very bad phone quality....i would have given it a zero if this option was available..my phone's screen became unresponsive just like that...in one month use...without any fall or break in the screen..now its not working even i factory reset my phone....My suggestion do not buy this phone....

"
"

  Camera Quality: average though the specifications state high.Battery: Good in the price rangeSoftware: worst in the price range.Its been a month and the product with OS issues more than thrice, and poweroff/ON issues are consistent with the product, The Device stop's performing.

"
"

  I have used this product for past 3 day, from that experience I will say.This phone is really a monster interms of battery,camera and display.The processor is also good . There was no hanging situation till date.Am a heavy mobile user ,even for me the battery stays for 1.5 days , so it's for Shure that for a normal user it will last for 2 days

"
"

  The main advantage of the phone is battery life. Before I used redmi mobiles. This mobiles way more better than that. Somebody think redmi is a gaming mobile.. that's true. Here  you can play games in good quality. For normal usage, this is one of the best mobile. Above photo I just clicked in normal mode.

"
"

  Writing this review after about 3 weeks of use.pros:This phone has amazing display. Thats it.Cons:M21 has serious wifi problem. It can not detect a wifi signal if you are in a different room.Fingerprint scanner does not work often.Heats up on charging.Takes a very long time to charge.

"
"

  The phone is awesome. It just the camera quality is very bad. Like I have had high expectations for 48mp camera but it's quality is bad then my 16mp moto phone camera.Battery is more than awesome.... charging speed is also fast.Display is awesome too.Fingerprint sensor and face unlock is also awesome.

"
"

  Pros:1. Satisfied display2. Battery life3. Decent camera quality4. Good audio with Dolby atmos5. Detailed image in selfie cameraCons:1. Charging time is too high (Powerful charger can be provided)2. Not for heavy usage3. Old design. Can be improved.

"
"

  My device is having issues, the wide angle camera is dirty from inside and the condition is worsening.Tried talking to Amazon and no relief.The device also has battery issues, and 48mp camera is not adequate.

"
"

  Perfect phone for those who need a super duper 6000mah battery life and need an sAmoled screen. Above par performance with a great camera and a slim profile overall and fortunately a non chinese brand!

"
"

  It's been a month since I bought this phone.I have really liked the back up of battery it has been providing. The camera quality is good. U can have good movie watch experience with the Super Amoled display it has.Overall with the price it is available and the features that are being provided it is a good choice for anyone to have.

"
"

  Best phone under this price segment.Camera is the best 5/5.üòçüòçFingerprint 4/5 because sometimes it do not works.üòïüòïDisplay 5/5 as you know samsung's display is bestest in the market.üòçüòçSpeaker 4/5 not that much good but acceptable as mostly i hear music via headphonesüíú, so its not a big problem for me.üôÇ

"
"

  Its soooo good I didn't get any trouble in this mobile and its weight not like 6000mah its pictures in lighting super but in low light its ok the gaming performances is also good there is no issue with gaming like COD,PUBG and some others and it's display is awesome totally this is a good mobile for this range.......

"
"

  Screen, sound, camera, touch & fingerprint all features are good but the battery performance is not upto the mark. Being 6000mAh the back time should be more but it is limited to 16 -18 hours on full use and it also take huge time approx 3 - 4hrs to get 100% charge. Else all are good.So overall a good phone from Samsung in this Budget category.

"
"

  The battery is huge..powepacked totally..i mean what one needs in today's fast moving world..first nd last thing is battery life..where we often miss out to charge our phones, this huge 6000 mah battery powered samsung galaxy m21 6gb ram 128 gb memory is definitely my best choice so far..Would highly recommend it..ü•∞ü•∞

"
"

  worst product touch stopped working after 3 days, strictly dont buy. Amazon is not providing proper assistance. Exchange period is still active however no option to avail.It is very difficult to make a replacement even under replacement period.

"
"

  Thank you so much Amazon services for replacing My M21 phone. New Phone I received yesterday and it's no scratch ,screen is good ,and battery lif also good.Best phone for youngers

"
"

  Awesome battery life....lasts for almost two days .... storage is also great at this price range .... Camera is fabulous with 48mp back camera .... Only one drawback is its large size .... Fingerprint reader is also great ... Triple rear camera is cool .... It offers 6gb ram also .... If u are planning to buy a phone at this price range it's definitely worth it ....

"
"

  The camera quality is awesome but if talk about battery it is 6000mah therefore it take more then half an hour to full charge, fingerprint perform well the main thing is that display has won the heart by performing outstanding color contrast with attractive 4k video.

"
"

  M21 is really a monster. The cameras are awesome, battery life is superb and the phone really looks sexy. Getting such a great phone in 13999 ruppees is highly recommended for everyone. Dont hesitate, just buy it!! The only bad thing is that samsung didnt give an earphone along with the phone. But the phone is really awesome!!!!!üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

"
"

  very very bad service. will never buy Samsung again.Service center denied the request for repair. told no part can't do much here

"
"

  1.For regular work perfect.2. Display quality superb.3.if you are heavy gamer means (pubg for 5to 6 hr) not for you4. If you are a casual gamers then it's good5. Charging time 2:15 to 2:30 mins and after chare I used almost 1and half dayAnd I am a casual gamer.Over all if you are not a heavy gamer go for it

"
"

  Looks like Samsung takin all the Chinese make Indian phone market with M series range, This z my 2nd M series purchase in last 1 year for my dear ones....

"
"

  I am using the phone since last 1 month and its performance is very good. Though the hardware quality seems to be little downside but software and working of the phone is fast and also Samsung UI is very clean and easy to use. Don't know about gaming things because i am not a gamer but for other purpose its definitely recommended.

"
"

  Pros- Amazing display, decent camera, and quick sensors response,handy and unique smart features.Cons - despite being a battery monster it's battery doesn't last as long as it should and takes 2.5 hrs to fully charge, speakers are loud but not that sharp and clear, features are limited, no free font change options, and not so good processor.

"
"

  Truly saying first I got the phone I was so excited for the phone ,keep using this phone i experienced it as a friend in my loneliness but that day when it worked giving my parents smile by YouTubes hilarious adorable cute videos camera fantasy features ,make calls loving relatives from far away villages..... It is More Than A Friend To Meüòáüòá

"
"

  Best in this price range.‚Ä¢Battery last long even in high usage.‚Ä¢Camera is awesome. You can even record slow motion videos.‚Ä¢Fingerprint does its job smoothly.‚Ä¢You will love its design.

"
"

  This is an amazing phone under budget . If I'm not crossing any line ,I would say this is a better phone than any Redmi, oppo,vivo budget phones . The camera is amazing on this phone and the display is just fabulous.  Its battery life is at another level . I would suggest any college going student like me to buy this phone . üëåüëçüëç

"
"

  Disappointed with the product.screen display is yellow, which is irritatingDocuments photos are getting blurred.apps like One-note are getting hanged.I thing money got wasted.

"
"

  I have use this device for almost 2 months & first thing first I LOVE THIS DEVICE. This is best device in this budget range with good company background. And get your all job done (Gaming, Photos, Call, internet, music & very good display with powerful battery life).Highly recommended because I also planning to buy 2 more same device

"
"

  Not compatible with Google apps like google playstore. Finger print not easy accessible. Screen shot is not an easy task when compare with Redmi and MotoG phones. Not possible to run 3-4 apps at same time. Phone will get hangup. Camera clarity is good enough when comparing to others. Not recommended for regular use.

"
"

  Still has to use the mobile to the fullest but still there it is extremely best mobile for that price and very much satisfied for the offer provided for me at the time of purchase go with ot of you are looking for a budget phone with extraordinarily designed features

"
"

  ¬†Very good product at this price range and display is amazing Samoled.. i really loved this camera quality is very good.. speaker quality want to improve but that is not a big problem.. otherwise this is obe of the best phobe in this price range..

"
"

  With in ‚Çπ13999/- it is very very very good mobile. Video feature like slow motion is very enjoyable . Low light photo is not good.. as expected from a small sensor. Display is the best. HD video is eye soothing. Finger print buttons r good . Hope it will be a good friend for a long time.

"
"

  Awesome product with affordable cost. I had an option to buy moto mobile but moto has snapdragon os chinese made. That's why I bought samsung rather than chinese product or there any parts on available on its phone.

"
"

  I encountered a issue on 15th day after my purchase, i went to the service center they didn't replace the device but repair it. Next day, the device encountered another issue which is still being repaired at the centre.The device is unreliable and the service team is unwilling to resolve the issue but wants me to keep repairing it.

"
"

  Fluidic performance, never a fps drop in most of the games.  The name says it all 'watta monster', it's equipped with all (fast charging, good camera, face ID unlock).

"
"

  Pros:Battery regular use gives 26-27 hours usage. Hotspot on for full time or screen on for at least 15-16 hours. 4G on for full time.Perfect choice For normal day to day usage without lag or hang.Camera is ok.Speed good.Multitasking great.

"
"

  This phone is good and I recommend it. In this budget m21 is a good phone. Battery life is good.. after 2 hrs of YouTube watching the battery was reduced by 17% only. Camera quality is not bad. No heating problem..phone looks good. After using it for 2 days I am satisfied with my decision.

"
"

  MANY PEOPLE AND REVIEWERS POST THEIR VIDEOS SAYING  9611 IS SLOW SAMSUNGS PHONES HANG. BUT TRUST ME , BIG BRANDS LIKE SAMSUNG OPTIMIZE THE PHONE VERY WELL. YOU WONT FEEL THIS AS SLOW PHONE . NOT FOR SUPER DUPER GAMING THOUGH. BUT ALL OTHER TASKS GO SEAMLESS. FAR CLEANER , SMOOTHER , BETTER AND SECURE THAN ALL THOSE VULGAR SPYING CHINESE CRAP.

"
"

  Its been more than a week since I am using this phone and I have to say it's amazing.Battery Life , Camera Quality ,sAMOLED screen everything is great.Only con is 15w charger, They should have provided atleast 20w . But you get 6000mah battery so i think i cant complaint .Overall a great product which is also made in India .

"
"

  Excellent phone under 15k range. The best quality i found is the battery life .It lasted about 1.5days even i used the hotspot for my work life the entire day. Second one is , it is very light inspite of having 6000mAh battery.Only mistake i found  is the placing of audio jack (it is on the bottom side) ,giving me trouble in handling the phone while using earphone.

"
"

  The product is excellent and best perfomence by Samsung m21 but note one thing on the stsrting 5-6 days the battery will not work properly feels like 4000mah but dont worry it will work better after 5-6 daysBut the selfie camera of the phone is not much better as compared to other phone back camera is working better

"
"

  Excellent  phone in this renge, battery  backup is extraordinary,  camera is superb  specially a selfie camera, look is simple,  little bit heavy in weight...One drawback  is battery  charging  very slow, it takes near about  5 hours to complete  100% charge when mobile  is off

"
"

  Awesome product, samsung always rocks nd i m a big fan...never disappoints.

"
"

  It‚Äôs been only 2 days I received this product I bought it for my mother it‚Äôs good for people who aren‚Äôt too much tech savvy and want a decent smartphone.

"
"

  Display is really great. Fingerprint reader is quick. Camera quality great8 hour (2.5 hrs Amazon prime) of used still 66% battery remainingSmooth touchscreen.My last Samsung galaxy J5 (2016) is still working.Best brand everMuch better than any other BrandGood for Gaming

"
"

  Product is very nice,  but again same Samsung problem hanging,  several times call reciveing time hanging.Battery is good.Camera quality also good.Kindly improve hanging problems.

"
"

  A good smartphone, cameras could have been little better (thought its not bad) else everything is just fantastic- Display, Battery, Software, Performance !

"
"

  M21 is nice phone in the mid range smartphone between 10k to 20k. Speciality is wide angle camera alongwith slomo and ultra slomo feature. Battery back up is good. Post COVID situation this phone is very much useful as within the range the storage capacity and picture quality will satisfy all persons who need smartphone support.

"
"

  Camera is best in this price range...... Fingerprint must improve...... And the main thing is battery.... It has a 6000mah battery...... it is just good.... And not excellent....... Because i to be honest...... i expected more about battery backup...... Because of the YouTube reviews..... But I am slightly disappointed...... It comes to around 1 day not 2 days....

"
"

  I am using this from 2 months it is Sexy smartphone , lot of features i am happy to buy this phone, camera is superb best quality pictures, i think this is the best smartphone in india according to budget.Samsung is bestThanku samsungThanku amazon

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for fast delivery....ist time i am disappointed from amazon....phone was awesome n nice but i found dust inside the box and a minor scratch on phone....take care nxt time...otherwise i m happy

"
"

  I am using since Week,Battery life is excellentCamera is goodNot that much light in weightall good but on extensive use , we can feel some heat ( i m heavy user, 7/8 hours in day).Function n process is superb.Good budget phone

"
"

  I have been using phone whole day during the lockdown and its it working just great. The battery is working perfectly, the front camera and overall performance is also satisfactory. The rear isn't as good as I expected. That is the only minor fault I could find other than a little lagging. But since I don't click photos very often, the phone is perfect for me.

"
"

  My dad's realme 6i better than this phone. Worst processor ex9611 heating issue, lags in animation. Only 7hr screen on time realme 6i :- 12hr. Don't purchase samsung exynos processor mobile phones. Awesome display, Better THAN any Chinese phone. Worst built quality plastic used by Samsung. Don't use this phone without back case.

"
"

  Very nice and smooth phone. Long battery life, clear photos and very good call quality. What's more,it's Made in India and most importantly, not a Chinese firm. In my opinion, better than Redmi.

"
"

  Awesome phone my Aunt loves it Big brother say thanks to me

"
"

  I have bought 4 GB RAM, 64 GB ROM variant 1month back, so far its working like a flagship device with good speed and long lasting battery life. I have updated mine with Android 10, 2.1 One UI core version. Its smooth and fine. I recommend this phone for those who are going for a budget device with optimum quality.

"
"

  Don't buy sound output is extremely bad worst experience,  when contact Amazon customer support they refused to replace or return as i was calling on 13th day and thier return period was 10days only .Dont waste your money on this device better to buy Redmi or some other brand ...bad experience

  Very good at this price point. Would definitely recommend to buy. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock works pretty fast. Battery backup awesome and camera quality is decent but can be better. Already received a software update in sept for UI 2.1. Back is susceptible to scratches so definitely buy a back cover. Great purchase.

"
"

  The fingerprint reader scans one out every 5 times I place my finger on it which leads in my phone getting disabled and then forcing me to use my pattern or pinThe battery life is just amazing like it is wow I can use and play high battery and fps shooter games for 2 to 3 hours and the matter will only drop by 10% maximum

"
"

  Its a defective piece... After 2 days the finger print sensor stopped working when I called up the customer care they told all the measures and I did everything but nothing changed... Now the call hearing speaker is not working and I can't get a place to complain also... very bad experience... Now what to do with the phone ????

"
"

  Battery is just awesome. If you are a normal user you will forget when you charged your phone last time. Fingerprint is works perfectly. If you talk about screen, it's  a s-amoled display and I believe  no other brand can give such a beautiful display except  Samsung.Ad camera is good at this price point with Samsung  branding.

"
"

  A big complaint, when I opened the box little bit dust there , some scratches on the back cover seems they have sended the opened product, Amazon have to be strict in this matter.

"
"

  Finger print and camera is good.even face detection is good for the phone at this range. Chrome cast does not work effectively. Also the volume is low in phone calls. You might have to use earphones

"
"

  Poor mobile ....for gaming ..worst mobile ...netqork issues  ..internet speed is very slow ....please do not buy this  .....worst mobile i ever used ....total wastage of 15999 rs

"
"

  The mobile is very good overall.1. Battery is great 5/52. Camera is good 4/53. Fingerprint sensor 1/54. Screen sAmoled great 5/5 but you would need to apply screen guard.5. Rest everything is fine6. Slightly expensive.

"

  Best. Non chines phoneSecure from other chines phoneBattery backup more than 12 hoursBest display phone in this price rangeLite or thin phone with 6000 nah batteryBack plastics us cheap plastic and screech easily

  Samsung M21 is truly Marvellous, talking about It's Camera it feels so real, moster battery life, amazing sound embedded with Dolby atmos and quick finger print reader add to this product and makes it a master peice also there are many features which ssurely adds beauty to it...loving it

"
"

  I was using MI phone. Just want to buy a non Chinese phone. But not upto MI 5pro. Samsung must improve in all performance.

"
"

  In this price rate that is thw Best Mobile....because Huge battry life, Camera Quality is also best...Display quality also powerful...thandk you Samsung.Fingerprint reader is vey fast...and Convenient fo lock unlock....Faceunlock also fast profming..I have purchased 6/128...is sufficient starage amount in this in this price rate..

"
"

  Superb thanks to Samsung üëçüëçJust one word Amazing

"
"

  I am absolutely  happy  with my decision  of buying  this Samsung M21 phone . I wanted a phone with good battery life . I charge once in two days if I use it more or once in 3 days . Camera quality  is so good which I actually  did not expect  .And touch sense is so smooth ...All in all a very good phone ... must say a tough competitor for phones of 40k or 50 k

"
"

  Network connection efficiency is not so good. Inside a house full tower is not obtained. Probably the 'Gain' is low. So I am in doubt whether the set is defective or not. Pls ensure me. It has taken 7minutes to upload a game  of 6.79 mb.

"
"

  Worthy penny...no words say1.Awesome battery life2.Crips display in the price range3.Decent cameras4.Very good call quality and network connections5.Clear and crisp audio quality6.Decent performance on exynos96117.Good built quality at this price rangeMust buy this one for Samsung lovers...

"
"

  Samsung is best in all price ranges and it is proving it day by day.I bought this samsung m21 which I loved and satisfies my needs of good battery life and amazing display quality which we cant get it from other brands within this price range.And dont worry about processor,I am able to play pubg without any lag issues.

"
"

  Overall, a fantastic handset to own. The only downside I see is the signal strength. For some reason, this phone seems to have not so great network. Battery life will surpass your expectations.  Fingerprint reader is pretty fast. Camera quality is decent.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is so fast and its battery was very  excellent and its camera  of this phone is very  excellent it is a brilliant  phone and I loved this phone.

"
"

  Mobile is very good for daily use. But when i receive the phone back cover is slightly open from one corner so i press it and it fits perfectly. But after some days i notice dust particles in camera lense even though i never open back cover. Now i need to spen extra money to clean it. But still i am very happy with the mobile.

"
"

  I bought this phone off Amazon because i believed i will get what I purchased. But i have recieved this item on replacement but everytime the phone has issues either it be cosmetic or technical. My phone is not charging, there are scratches at certain areas. I have never had such experience. I feel like i never bought an item.

"
"

  I am not convinced/satisfied with fast charging. It takes around 3 hours to fully charge the phone, moreover 100% charged battery  does not last as it was promised.My google chrome also not getting updated from play store.I don't have much data/apps stored in the phone,still some application does not respond often.

"
"

  Heating issue. Can't use the phone. Tried to replace it, but customer care didn't follow up. Started using it, signal quality is very poor compared to other phones.

"
"

  Just an average product. Built is good. Display is good. Bulky coz of battery. But if we compare products of same range its bit over priced. MI and OPPO offers better experience in their ‚Çπ10000+12000 products. Can go for it if you are not a moderate-heavy user. Good for ladies and old aged

"
"

  Its a fantastic and must buy smartphone if you need a budget phone with an excellent battery life. Its fingerprint system is awesome too.camera quality is also good at this price range.there are some network connections issue with this smartphone that should be enhanced more.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

"
"

  Very good non Chinese option. Perfect for day to day normal usage. Battery back up is great. The processor and camera could have been better. BEST VALUE FOR MONEY NON CHINESE OPTION at this price point.

"
"

  samsung m21 is  just basic mobile for daily use to attend or reject calls. nothing to do with this device.suitable for just to make calls thats it.

"
"

  I bought this phone because Of its display and battery and For a moderate user like me , I have no complaints so far, I‚Äôm satisfied. Camera is just okay and not wow, go for it if you dnt mind about the camera.

"
"

  First time samsung catch the point .Now samsung comes with number of great option and rates. Amazing phone with great pricetotally justified .Camera feature great .Finger print must be great.display also superb.ram and phone performance greatDolby sound feels great.totally I satisfied .And finally retune to samsung and advice to other .

"
"

  This(Samsung Galaxy M21) is the best mobile in this range that is 12699 rupees.This mobile have many specification :1)Camera quality is very good.2) Display quality is high.3)mobile processor is very good in this range.4) This is good for playing games like PUBG.We can play video games in high graphics.5) Battery life is long.

"
"

  Good phone for the price.. .Camera is excellent.Phone has got nice new features.But battery takes wayyyyy too long to charge. Takes about 3 hrs to charge from 10-100%.But once charged lasts for 4 days with minimal usage

"
"

  It has been a month since I bought this mobile. So far no issues and works smooth. This phone has all the good features from clear display to in built maintenance provisions. For this price and the capabilities and for the brand Samsung, this is the right product and it is worth buying.

"
"

  I purchased this as a gift for my brother, and he is loving it. He is amazed by the performance. Although He got it recently and had been using since last week but till now everything is more than expected. I will come back again for the review after using 6 months.I suggest this phone at this budget segment to everyone.

"
"

  Best phone under 15k . Recommended to buy . Nic battery life . Give a average standby of 1day(if pubg not played). Else depending upon usage. Not Chinese phone is the main thing.

"
"

"
"

  After more than 1 month of usage I am extremely satisfied with this.Battery, sAmoled display, One UI, Camera and Samsung's brand value is more than enough to  buy this in this price range.I am a happy M30 user for the past 16 months and bought this for my brother.

"
"

  Nice rear camera and nice selfie camera but front camera struggles at night , sound is superb, display is awesome, battery is ok, fingerprint reader fast.

"
"

  I bought this mobile especially because of its camera and 6000mah battery.But I m extremely disappointed by its battery backup. It hardly gives the talk time of 20 to 24 hrs

"
"

  Finger print reader is good and sensitive . Now getting battery life up to 1.5 days after full charge and the fast charger  is also goodOnly negative I felt is the length  of USB cable not even 1 meters.  Not providing  head set so can include 1 meter cable for charger which is convenient. This I felt after one week of use

"
"

  Along with the amazing camera which is 48mp and 20mp the phone has great user interface, amazing battery life which lasts for approximately 2 days. The quality of the fingerprint reader is at par and works like magic. If you're looking for a phone within your budget along with great features, M21 is your only choice, brilliant. Thank you!

"
"

  Best Made in India Smartphone. at 13999 Rs Price Range it's all good. Wifi-calling, HD contents and most special AMOLED screen, with fingerprint censor and Exynos 9611 are some best in class features in it. if you use with a flip cover or a back cover it's Plastic built quality does not have any issue. For Brand like Samsung it's Best. Go for it.

"
"

  Finger print scanner is not working upto the mark, it took nearly 3 initial trial to recognize my finger print, once it find so then it work good for sometime and the same issue repeats when it ideal for some hrs. Other than that everything is smooth and camera quality is better! Battery performance was awesome!

"
"

  At this price it is a good smartphone with monsterous battery which will keep you going and a decent camera quality which can help you to capture amazing moments Brought for my brother he is happy with is . A bundle of joy from samsung , and good and decent phone .

"
"

  i am not happy charging 99% in the morning than battery down evening 5PM uptoand mobile is very heat in the charging .please help the procedure of return the mobile .i have used ZenFone 2 Laser (ZE550KL) 5000 MAH LAST THREE YEAR'S NO ANY PROBLEM  OF BATTERY 99% CHARGE RUNNING ONE AND HALF DAY AND NO HEATING.

"
"

  The battery is not the ""monster"" it's made out to be. It does not last even 24 hours let alone what's being touted.And this from a novice user who only uses WhatsApp and phone calling ... no games, no movies no nothing else!!Being a hardcore Samsung loyalist for all gadgets ... wuite disappointed if not let down!!

"
"

  I ordered it for my Father.Its not a phone for gamers but for normal usage it is pretty good.Fingerprint scanner is not good.Camera quality average.Battery Backup excellent.Super Amoled in this price range is Great.Overall it is a phone for light usage.

"
"

  Samsung galaxy M21 is the budget smartphone available in India.I recommed this smartphone to every person who wants a smartphone with best camera quality, fingerprint sensor, and other biometric sensors, best display and with a powerfull monster battery of 6000mAh.This smartphone is better than any other smartphone at this range.

"
"

  I got this product one week it worked properly but after a week it started hanging and it takes hours to come to normal . Also the touch screen doesn't work properly .... Now it's of no use to me . Since the return date is gone I m not able to return this product ... My 15999 money lost ...  Help to resolve and fix this please

"
"

  Best phone I find at the price range of 13 k. this was the only one I could find which was not made in China on Amazon. Hence I grab the offer and quickly ordered. Delivery was superb, well on time. Phone came in a good packaging. All in all a best buy if you are looking for not in China made phone

"
"

  Amazing smartphone, camera is just awesome, soud is loud enough, charging is fast, amazing battery life, it can run 2 days with normal usage.  Ram management is perfect. Display is amazing. In this price the pefect smartphone in every aspects.

"
"

  Its a balanced package, nothing exceptional nor anything would turn you off.Camera is ok, low light shots are not very impressive.Overall its a good buy

"
"

  The design is quite attractive...also the battery,  though it takes 2.5 hrs to full charge but on a normal usage it surely lasts for 48 hours....and u can trust me I am reviewing this product after 6 days of usage....The camera quality is also pretty good...The performance is very smooth...U can go for it without hesitation.

"
"

  As discussed with u r customer he said that charged mobile compulsory 4 to 5hours. I connected 5 hours but my mobile not chagerd full percentage.This is worst product and revert back with ur customer.

"
"

  Well i just bought it recently n don't know much about it being Senior citizen perhaps in the course of time, I'll be able to know

"
"

  UI is greatBuild quality is okCamera is 48MP but clicks photos like an 8MPMy J7 Max 13MP camera is way betterAutofocus is very bad ,same like other samsung midrangersOverall if u can Ignore Camera quality, The phone is value for money and ofcouse it is a korean brand not chinese.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is one of the fastest in the market. Battery life is humongous for all the multi-tasking in entire day, still doesn't drain to off. Camera takes really good quality pictures. The vibrant mode of Samsung is truly vibrant and renders crisp detailing of resolution. Clicked vibrant photo of a garden by Samsung M21 rear camera.

"
"

  Nice phone, latest features, super amoled screen working very smooth and colors are also very rich. Fingerprint reader working quite well and face unlock is awesome. Camera quality is very good, sharpness is a bit low but not a big problem. At last battery life is awesome, it can last upto 2 days with heavy usage and gaming.

  The device may rightfully boast its superior battery, display, processor and camera but it is just a glorified toy because of its worst mobile network reception. It does not even do the basic function of a ""PHONE"". Google ""Samsung Galaxy M21 network issue"" to get the full, unbiased and user centric picture before you get conned like me.

"
"

  All function are good bat networking problem very slowly net with phone calling problem

"
"

  Battery life is superb and touch is also good. Camera is perfect as you want in this price range.and best thing is that in my home I am the only one who buy Samsung and it's really amazing but my brother said that after 6-8 month of use Samsung's phone gonna hang.And I want to prove him wron,let's see. And everything is good in this range.

"
"

  That is what is known as comeback... Many mster it really is. I watched a couple of movies and webseries and my battery still didn't get down.The camera works better than canon or Nikon. The fingerprint and the face recognition work like hell.And the best part I get it all for 12699. Way to go SamsungDon't think have a go and be happy.

"
"

  Got it for‚Çπ 12699 on 15may 2020. Best value for money phone with super amoled screen. Its specs are comparable with other phones available in market on current date. It lacks fast charges inside box, takes 4 hours for full charge from zero with provided charges. Rest be assured it will not disappoint you at any front on performance and specs.

"
"

  Camara is standards  quality. There is issue with printer option and saving data. But complicated then other mobile. And i am happy with other performances.

"
"

  My review after 2 weekPros-display goodCamera-goodCons- battery is not upto mark  my previous mobile which had 4000mah was performing better than this, front camera water drop notch irritates meBut above all this is not a Chinese phoneRest it's ur choice.

"
"

  This review after 3 week from my purchase date. Fingerprint sensor are not working properly, battery life is good and camera quality is also good. For gaming purposes this set is not suitable it lag too much and again I want to say u that fingerprint are not working well always I have to use my pin to open it.

"
"

  M21 is really a good smartphone.Battery life is really good and it's fingerprint sensors response is really good.i am using it from last one month.In my case processor even works really well for my heavy multi tasks to all other apps.mainly I love the One UI here and trust me.go for it.this phone won't disappoint you.

"
"

  I never bought a Samsung mobile before but I decided to try it so I purchased Samsung m21Trust me it is too good man,battery life is excellent and camera is also good and even with 6000 mah battery the mobile is very light to handle display is also amazing just go for Samsung if u want your best phone which lasts long

"
"

  Best performanceCamera quality: Marvelous and natural and vibrant coloursBattery life : lasts more than 30 hrsPerformance: Simply superbRecommendation: You can go in for it.

"
"

  Using it for 3 days. But don't  know why it gets switched  off  automatically  even when battery  is  full.

"
"

  After 10 days of usage, am facing heating issue while playing entry level game. note : not high level game like pubg or COD. Battery life better. And average camera. Super steady camera video quality is very worst. Imagine quality average. Image quality is looks like 12 mp not 48 mp. Samsung need to improve camera quality.

"
"

  This phone provides a good One UI 2 interface, a better performance, good Camera, great battery.A good package from Samsung

"
"

  Ordered this in prime day sale. Awesome product in this price value for money.I liked the camera future images captured with this phone are as clear as the DSLR cameras. It has huge capacity Battery once you full charged it can go for two days. processor is very fast with no lags.. overall nice product with great features

"
"

  The phone has a premium look. Touch sensitivity and screen resolution is just awesome. 2 days battery backup. Camera quality is incredible. I bought this for my parents and now I envy them. The phone is just too good.

"
"

  Heating problem is a measure problem.Not working properly üòí

"
"

  Fingerprint reader takes a few tries, not very efficient. The battery life is also not up to the mark as it has 6000mah but still works as if 4000mah. The front camera gives a warm texture to the picture which doesn't really look nice.

"
"

  Great phone packed with awesome features in the midrange segment. The 6000mAh battery gives you atleast a day and half of run time on full charge.  With the sAMOLED display, colors are vivid and video streams are awesome to watch. Camera is awesome. Call quality and sound are also top notch. Overall satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Phone is so awesome its built quality is very good its performance and all over is very goodI buy this phone for studying online and I charge phone one in a day and keep continue studying till 6pm and its battery is so good and its camera is also good and all phone is so very good in this budget.......

"
"

  1st is thanks for Amazon.2nd is absolutely trusted for seller 100 % .3rd is Samsung is valuable brand.4th is 2days battery backup, nice resolution, etc..5th is missed copy of invoice.

"
"

  Please check fingerprint sensor at the time of unboxing, I got damaged first on replacement I got little damged again....battery life is also not up to the mark because the charging is not fast....and camera is also not good, I will suggest you to buy this phone if you very less work on the phone.

"
"

  Best under 13k if you don't care about gaming. Fingerprint reader is fast enough, battery life is awesome, it gives around 15 hrs screen on time for normal usage. Camera quality is good for this price range. It gives 40-45 fps in pubg smooth-extreme settings.

"
"

  Review after 60 days of usage. Phone speak excellent battery good look good only problem while speaking the other end not able to hear if the phone placed in right side in m21

"
"

  Just Hate this phone...network performance is totally slow üò° waste of money. Camera quality also not good. So many problems in this phone..

"
"

  The phone is good enough.the camera is satisfied. But i little bit unsatisfied with the battery quality. 6000mah battery should  last for one and half day but it is ok. The best thing about the phone is the amoled display i am very happy with it. Game performance is good enough but not the best. The ui was Little bit disappointed also.

"
"

  Overall nice smartphone at this price. Delivers awesome camera quality in both light and dark. Superb display thanks to samoled. But takes about 3 hrs to full charge which is a major drawback and drains faster as normal 3500 mAH battery.It must have some fast charging support such as vivo dual engine .It's allrounder smartphone at budget friendly rate.

"
"

  Completely satisfied with the battery life, 75% battery last for more than 1 day with normal usage ex. calls, browsing, scrolling etc. Good camera quality for this much price. Haven't seen issue with normal usage, i have inetalled around 50 apps and it works smoothly but will not recommend for heavy game users.

"
"

  Phone is heating heavyly during charging time between 30-60 percentage..battery  draining vastly.. camera is Extraordinarily one..screen is Extraordinary..Dolby atmos feature didn't works properlyBut in this price range this phone is worth for money

"
"

  After 3 months use-----1.Battery is the game changer when it comes to compete....2. Gaming performance is ok....not bad...doesn't lag , processing is good3. Amoled screen....(other companies cries in silence.)4. For day to day normal use with moderate gaming, this mobile will last for long I guess....üòÅ...

"
"

  I had a very good experience with samsung I purchased first time from samsung m21 is best except the processor which is a bit mid range but it's good with all the features of one ui and samsung support it comes with overall the best phone and it doesn't even heat up when playing games or using camera and the display is the best.

"
"

  Very nice  mobile  in this price , so much featured  I got in this price! After all  it is good brand so buy it  without  much worring

"
"

  Don't  buying it.it is a not working speaker's. I I will also concern to the Samsung company service centre update the phone but not working today speakers sound so it is not good phone please don't buying gay

"
"

  Fingerprint and battery  life is really good, battery  withstands  upto 10 hours  while playing  PUBG ,but it's  have lagging  issues. Due to plastic  body panel it's  easily scratched in back side. Slow motion  capture  in camera  it's  really  wonderful. For PUBG game it's  not that much good. The normal  usage  this phone is wonderful

"
"

  This is the best phone to buy in this price point. The camera of the phone is outstanding. The display is phenomenus with bright atmosphere.It's fingerprint reader is also very fast and secure. Most amazing part is the giant 6000 mah battery life.Overall it is the best phone I will say it is the best phone to buy.#WATTAMONSTER

"
"

  M21 is the best budget smartphone.. the ui is clean not laggy no ads in the ui ..the performance of the chip is top-notch you can play pubg at highest settings, after playing 2 to 3 hr straight will still left you with 30% baterry which is imeprsive and everybody knows how samsung screen perform the best in the industry .....

"
"

  I am using the phone from one week. I felt so good after changing to Samsung. Excellent Camera, Excellent battery (1.5 day on moderate use), Excellent Performance. Excellent Build Quality. Top notch Display.Highly recommend to everyone

"
"

  Never buy a Samsung phone in discount even for a rupee. You live will become hell chasing service centre . Doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs s series or m series, they will give trouble mostly hardware failure.It has happen with me twice galaxy s9 and m21, motherboard crashed within 24 hour.

"
"

  Pathetic to note that Samsung Company did not provide even a cheap handsfree with the phone & they expect people to drive safely

"
"

  Dont by this product everyoneAfter using 4-5 days issue generate automatically  restarting,  laging issue battery backup low continuously

"
"

  It's an awesome phone in this range . It's battery is superb . On a single charge i can use this phone for almost 2 days . So, if you want a decent looking phone with Good battery life just go for it . I have bought 2 M21 phones one in Black colour while other one in Blue and both are just superb.

"
"

  This phone have massive battery life like the real monster, touch response is amazing and display quality is wonderful due to FHD+ SUPER AMOLED screen.48 MP camera taking a amazing picture and selfie also good.I watch Netflix content in FHD due to L2 support.This is a real monster phone.I suggest this phone to buy.

"
"

  With in 10days from purchase date, touch stopped working, amazon has 7 days replacement policy, service center guys says phone can not be replaced because you purchased online. worst service, worst product.

"
"

  Excellent piece from Samsung at such a reasonable price. Amoled display makes the phone look classy.The only disappointment is internal memory 128 GB is just for the sake of marketing actually they give only 115gb. Same with the ram u get only 3.8GB usable ram.Delivery is quick even in the lockdown

"
"

  Best smart phone in this price range. I see lot of improvement in samsung now as compared to previous budget phones. I like the phone very much. The screen, it's awesome no budget phone has this kind of screen you will love it. The battery it's a monster. Go for it if you are trying to buy a budget phone below 13000 rupees.

"
"

  C'mon samsung stop scamming people. The battery doesnt feel like a 6000mAH one. This was not expected from a reputed brand like yours. Expectations are not met with this device thats all i would say. Be careful people.

"
"

  I bought it 10 days back and I'm really satisfied with it's performance. The battery is everlasting and the fast charging option is cherry on top. No lagging in games;good processor; Device doesn't get heated even after playing for 2 hours straight. Front and rear camera is outstanding. If you're looking for a phone under 15k this might be your best choice.

  Likes- battery, samsung amoled display.When we take picture with 48 MP option of camera it takes too much time to save  photo.The display ring on icon of camera keeps roatating for lengthier time.

"
"

  M21 of Samsung is a real beast , It has the best Screen with so enhanced picture quality, its 6000mah battery is amazing last 1 and half days with normal usage. There are no unnecessary ads like . It is the best phone in this price range..

  1 st prize battery backup. 2nd prize  ram and internal memory 3 rd price disply awesome. Total i satisfied  this mobile.But totally  camera  very worst.  So improve that quality part to the customer care samsung. My kind advice

"
"

  Everything is perfect on this phone according to its price. I have a small issue with the selfie camera, as it gives little flattened photos as if a filter has been used. Hope this will be eliminated by a software update.

  This phone i bought under exchange offer and with in 2 days it's charging cable started not working properly seems like Amazon provided old cable with it which was not original and also phone starts to hang with in 2 days. Worse service I've ever get through amazon. Please don't buy anything under exchange offers. They just fool you

"
"

  THE BEST SMARTPHONE this is the best cheap and best phone for this price the 6000mah monster battery is beast.....and this phone has really a best features and the camera quality is also awesome.....and the shape of the camera slot is osm ....over all iam in love with samsung....#SAMSUNGM21...BEAST.....

"
"

  The video quality is premium. Must have for binge watchers of phone. The Amoled screen is very nice. The humongous battery sustains itself on heavy usage. The camera app and the physical camera are a perfect duo. Samsung themes and fonts are fun to watch. I would certainly recommend it to those who want to spend quality time on screen.

  It is an all in one phone which comes with some awesome features.I gifted it to my brother nad he is glad to have it. He is currently in twelfth standard and this phone is really helpful for him for his online studies as it has such a good amoled display and a good supportive 6000 mAh battey.

"
"

  Battery life averageBut don't charge fast for sure.Stop making false claims.

"
"

  Great battery life and fast charging. The display is brilliant and makes watching hotstar and NETFLIX fun. The colors are very vibrant and the experience is amazing. No lagging issues. Fingerprint reader is flawless. Camera quality is the best among the pack.

"
"

  Very Good mobile phone in this range. 6000AH battery run for two days with full use without charging. Fast charging also. Camera quality is good as expected. Fingerprint work within micro second. Look wise beautiful. No heating on playing game. Smooth working

"
"

  Its value for money. In this price the device has amazing features and also delivered in good condition by Amazon.I love it but I compared its 48 mp camera photo with a 24 mp camera and I found the photo of 24 mp was better than 48 mp of m21. It may be possible  that it can be improved later in upcoming updates.

"
"

  Overall a complete package at 14k for day to day usagebattery - 4 days backup day to day usecamera - not up to markbuild - plastic back and no cover in box and no protection on screenprocessor - Truly Not for games I tried free fire and it lagcharging - 2.5 hours 0-100% chargeDisplay - Truly amazing

  I bought new Samsung M21 a month back, it was working fine but now i am facing battery issue i hope, i could not able to recharge my mobile battery, the charger is working fine, i tested with other mobile, so No issue with Charger/Adapter- suspecting the mobile charge pin only.Pls let me know, can you replace the mobile phone.

"
"

  The very first thing i loved about amazon is it delivered the phone only in 2 days....The phone is unbelievable, uncommentable, those who are thinking to buy this should go ahead without thinking twice.. camera has got no words to describe i mean it is that good... i m seriously in luv wid the phone.. extremely loved the phone!!!

"
"

  Loving this product, only wished that the performance could me a little better and instead of the depth camera, it had a macro camera, but other than that, the phone is good.

"
"

  Simply the best smartphone under 20,000..Not only just battery, but its display..its camera..its user interface, its features and everything about this smartphone is just smooth and flawless..Thank you for such a great smartphone with a budget friendly price..Love you SAMSUNG for forever.

"
"

  Ordered and received the mobile on next day itself. Very impressed with Amazon delivery speed. Mobile is brilliant and in a whole month usage haven't faced any issues.Finger print was slow and its fixed with recent update.Samsung's Single take is now made available for M21 too!

"
"

  Amazing for a Samsung Lover in this price range...an absolute winner in terms of display, camera and battery.There is a minor problem with the adaptive brightness hope samsung will fix it with software update.Overall the set is real monster....with an aggressive price. A pure made in india product...love samsung # boycott chinese phones.

"
"

  Around Rs.14000 this the best phone. I am using Samsung since 6 years ago. In this device Camera, battery is also good & the fingerprint reader is also fast. If you are playing to much game then this phone is not for you. There is some heating issue in this device. Otherwise It is a good phone around this price. You also go for it.

"
"

  Excellent Battery life, Outstanding camera quality and it's a amazing phone competitive to its price. It's operating system is most updated comparing to the cost. The phone also has a premium look. Most Impressed with it's battery backup. Samsung is a credible brand after all. The review is based on a 15 days experience of using phone.

"
"

  Phone is amazing. Its been 2 months since I m using this. Battery backup is around 22 hours. Camera quality amazing. Front camera not that clear but manageable. Back camera is very sharp. The device speed and performance is amazing and the features are great. Looks very stylish in hand. The display etc is also fabulous.

"
"

  Look and feel - good for 16,000 Rs. Overall satisfied.Camera and picture quality, I do not see anything extra great.At times, bio metric sensor doesn't work.Battery is said that it would long last as it is 6000 mAH, but at the end of day, it comes almost to 50% even with normal usage.

"
"

  Liked the phone. Display is very good and responsive. Both front and rear cameras are good, though there is room for improvement. Battery life, performance, storage space, etc. are very good. Overall good for this price.

"
"

  Pros-Awesome product.Value for money.Great battery life.Awesome screen quality.Cons-Heats up quickly.Back cover gets scratches so order back cover as well while purchasing.You will get some pre-installed apps like Netflix, Outlook which cannot be uninstalledReview points üåü  üåü  üåü

"
"

  Tish is the best smartphone for me but as expected that it would long till 10 to 11 hour but it doesn't stand on my belive.And when I compared this product with my old smartphone with same application and  battery 5000 mAh. Then that long last till 5:49 hrs and this long last till 6:04 hrs.

"
"

  There is no mode for using connection as LTE only.Option is LTE/3G/2G and that's why my connection always switches to 2G anytime.Like every single feature of this phone but the connectivity issue is the worst......

"
"

  This is really a good product launched by samsung M series... I Would give it 5 star but I am giving it only 4 star because it slowly reads the fingerprint compared to all the other phones... But overall it is really good product.. Everyone should definitely buy it ... FIRST STEP TO BUY INDIAN PRODUCT ... JAI HINDüáÆüá≥

"
"

  Don't buy any samsung phone I bought Samsung m21 in the month of june after month its stop charging through power with given charger when I give phone in service center they told it will take one week and will not covert in warranty.Very poor service from samsungNever expected this from brand like samsung

"
"

  It is the best non chinese phone in this price range.6000 mah monster battery which lasts upto 2 days on moderate usage(battery life varies on usage pattern). Smooth ad free One UI. It comes with amoled display which is brighter as compared to IPS display. Performance is also good not the best.Overall Nice product.

"
"

  I m fully satisfied with the product after using 3+ months. Everything is going well in the mobile specially display camera and battery back up are awesome. But I have no idea about game because i never play mobile games. The only weak point is it take long to charge and if your finger is little wet reader smtym missed.

"
"

  It is my first Samsung Mobile. It changes my thoughts and trust over samsung. Good battery backup. Good Finger sensor. Better camera. Overall a good phone for average users. And we are happy that samsung has started manufacturing it's mobile device in india.

"
"

  Best budget smartphone in this segment*Major pros are-6000 mah battery provides 2 day heavy use battery backup-48mp triple camera at its best- amazing design and color- smooth and best  gaming experience for pubg, cod, asphalt 9 and other high end games-best budget smartphone for binge watchers

"
"

  I'm  writing this review  after using it for 15 days...The only good thing in this phone is display...Phone gets hang while using whatsapp then what can we say...Battery life is not upto the mark....drains quickly and take time to get charge...Camera is got..Some basic features are missing...

"
"

  Reviewing after 3 days of use1 Stunning display performance2 Superb back camera ,48mp shooter does a pretty decent job3 Monstrous 6000 mah battery4 Samsung UI5 Exynos 9611 lag free processor within any heating issueAnd the best part is u get Samsung branding (#boycott Chinese products)

"
"

  Videos experience is good. Camera not impressed. Front camera is very bad. Battery life good. But only 15 watt charger is available in this package. Audio output with dolpy atmos impressed. Display looks premium. In hand feel was good. Weight less with 6000 mah battery

"
"

  Battery is very good.Back camera is good but front camera is ok.Processor is not well.Charging time is up to 3 and half hours.Phone hase hanging problem.Finger unlock is ok.Go for the other mobile company likes Realme/Vivo/Oppo/Motorola

"
"

  The full form of Samsung m21 is monster21. I Think the full form of m21 is monster king m21.It is great experience with me m21.  This is a superb üòçüòçü§©ü§©product from samsung . If someone want to buy the smartphones in the budget of 15000 then don't drop it it is amazing product from samsung I love this smartphone.

"
"

  The battery was supposed to be the monstrous 2 day battery. I'm sorry. It's quite pathetic  it's almost as good as my 3500 maah previous phone se battery. One day hardly. I was 100 percent at 5 a.m. its 1 p.m. and I'm at 20 percent and I don't even play pubg

"
"

  Not A very excellent phone in this segment but as it is a samsung phone people are most willing to purchase the phone. I did fall for the offer and have a decent experience with it. It has good camera,big battery but it faces the backup issue, it's not upto the mark. Overall I recommend to purchase this phone for Camera and display.

"
"

  Overall experience four out of five. Fingerprint reader four out of five, battery life and camera quality 5 out of 5. You can buy it without any hesitation.

"
"

  You can buy it blindly because Samsung is Samsung all the features are good . Very good battery backup but it is not good for gaming if you play games like pubg for 2-3hour.Camera quality is also very nice .fingerprint scanner is awesome it read in half of second.üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑAND IT IS BETTER THAN OTHER COMPANY SMARTPHONES.

"
"

  I really liked it so far. It has all modern and latest features like Face ID, Touch ID, high resolution camera.Photo quality is really good. It has wide angle camera. Selfies comes good.It has fast charging features which is a must for current lifestyle.So verbal it is best choice in this price range.

"
"

  I bought 6GB 128GB model and it is value for money. Super display,camera is awesome and good battery life. I am not a gamer, performance is excellent for office and personal use. I got screen on time around 7 hours with 30% battery left.Charging taking more time around 2h 20 mins.

"
"

  I bought this as a gift on fathers day for my dad, his basic usage is wats app, calls and video calls to us.He likes the phone and mentions that it is better than the old Redmi which he had.I also, chose this phone as i dont wish to support chinese made products and support their economy. So, i didnt order Redmi, poco etc

"
"

  This is the ideal mobile for non gamersBest battery, best display, great camera in this price segmentProcessor is ok, not for hardcore gamers.Perfect mobile for meIf u don't game alot, buy without a second thought

"
"

  Awesome product at this price range. Battery charging takes longer time than published but goes down quickly when falls 10%. Finger reader is very good. Camera quality is better.

"
"

  Very nice product I play PUBG on HDR ultraVery sharp and good quality Camera and it take 48MP photos and 4K recording and 6000mah Battery it have 2 days of battery lifeAnd 8 hrs of gaming and 12 hrs of 4k recording YOU CAN ALL SEE FULL INFORMATION ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNELASUR GAMING

"
"

  Very nice phone good camera and excellent battery good for basic gaming also must buyHowever you may get better specs from other brands in this budget the user experience  is not that great because they put ads in ui and also they don't respect our privacy so go for it without a second thought.

"
"

  Very avarage camera... Battery is like 4000 mAh...  UI not that great... No call recording option is added... you have to use the old method of pressing button for screen shot... very minimum option in camera settings. I just switched to Realme to this Samsung feel like I am using mobile of five years back. Very disappointed.

"
"

  Upper side heating problem.Battery drain in one day on normal use.Build quality is very poor.Camera and display are very good.So don't go for it. Waste of money

"
"

  Preferred this M21 over Oppo and Vivo1. Better Display sAMOLD2. Battery3. Camera Quality4. Ease of use and reliability.

"
"

  Ram management is poorcamera okbattery  just okPerformance ok but gaming worstI am not a gamer so this mobile was ok.

"
"

  I bought this Mobile for my mother and she liked it. Its bit heavy and large but functions are nice... Camera quality is good. Battery backup is acceptable but not as you expect from 6000mah battery. Overall worth for money.

"
"

  I had used redmi phone for 7 year then I switch to Samsung m21 ,it is best phone in its class 6gb/128 GBNo lagging, no heating problem found in batteryBest screen  for watching movies& very fine camera for daily useI suggested  every one to buy this phone .Great battery life for heavy user ,fast charging.

"
"

  No bill inside the packageAnd I don't understand  why Samsung guys are making 10 calls to me and forcing to give 5 stars rating. It's a harrassment. I haven't got this phone for free and purchased the phone for my very personal use not for review purpose.Phone is fine .

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is a good looking phone in a affordable price. Its fingerprint reader quality is best. And Also the battery life of this phone is longer than other phone. Because of 6000 mh battery power. Camera quality is also good. But i think Samsung need to work more on the backside of phone. Over all this is a good looking phone in this price.

"
"

  Worst phone ever ,initially it was working like light speed ,although not having much apps ,after 3 months it becomes as slow as rabbit , after seeing its specification I bought 3 phones,  OMG ,not sure what to do .

"
"

  Nice moble with quick fingerprint reader very good battery one and half Day we can use once charged.Very good cameras front and back With Advance technology.fullysatisfied with this moble.Cost to is not so High.

"
"

  Camera both primary and Secondary  are very good.Fast fingerprintBattery  backup  very good . Last for 1 day with heavy usage.4GB Ram & 64 GB internal very good for my need. IR sensor not available  with this. missing that feature

"
"

  After so many search & try in so called fake flash sale, i choose this m21.Look wise its not beutifull but screen display battery is awsm,I m not games lover so processor is good enough for me.I m using this device 48 hrs after full charge once.I think in ‚Çπ12600 its awsm choice.No ads No security issue

"
"

  I was looking for a good phone with all rounder performance. As the name M21 its a Monster with a great battery life. Even large sized apps runs with so much ease. The UI and customisations available makes the phone eye catchy. Camera is really good enough than expected in daylight. In indoor lighting the picture quality falls a bit.

"
"

  Worst product . only in one month mobile creates problem , screen become black . I got my mobile back after 5 days after changing screen . This is common in samsung mobile I think samsung is a problem facing mobile I always faced problem whenever I bought a samsung handset. life of new samsung mobile is only one year.

"
"

  My phone ,i.e. samsung galaxy m21 is getting heated from the very first day it arrived . It is just 3 three days and it is getting too much heated.Please fix this heating issue ...  ‚òÜ And also the bill content  is not printed properly ..  Hope you fix this problem also. Thanking you ,  M Biswas

"
"

  Audio not working while watching a video. Rarely it works. If we restart it may work sometimes. But not sure. Voice buttons are hard. Because of that taking a  screenshot is very difficult. I want to return the piece. As the last date for returning is over I am just checking the next option.

"
"

  Very very disappointed with Amazon & Samsung. The touch sensor stopped working from 10th day of delivery. Handset submitted to Samsung service centre and they will take 10 days to fix the problem.

"
"

  Samsung m21 all rounder best mobile.Best camera, very good battery life, eat body material, average weight, best performance, best display.

"
"

  The camera quality is really worst .The battery they said 6000 mah , but it works like 3000 mah.And how worst Amazon is that they are not accepting return request they don't know the customer values , even the customer is not likely to satisfy the product they are not accepting to take return

"
"

  The phone has to be restarted 4 to 5 times a day because SIM 1 frequently says not registered on network. Camera is good but fingerprint reader needs to be more sensitive.My husband and me both bought the same phone and are facing the same issues. Restarting the phone several times a day has become a nuisance.

"
"

  Bad network. Severe connectivity issues. Shows only single network bar for two different networks. Changed sims between sim slots. Also unable to cast screen even to Samsung smart tv. Shows connecting and then disappears. Bad battery back up, lasts only like a 2500 mah chinese brand.

"
"

  I ordered Samsung M21 (6/128 GB) on 26 june 2020, and received early from delivery date. I satisfied with this mobile feature at this  price from Samsung and this model is manufactured in India, thats the main thing. Main advantage is battery life that is 6000 MAH. Fast fingerprint reader with excellent quality camera.

"
"

  As per looks, mobile is awesome, its just what i wanted. It has fast charging and a very nice battery backup. Camera quality is good. Biometric feature is wonderful .touch pad sensorquality is good. Overall its a good buy.

"
"

  This Samsung phone is malfunctioning within a month time - swipe is not working and phone is switched off even though battery charge is there. i want a replacement for this phone. please advise return procedures.

"
"

  While using the video calling the other person can't hear at all on the other side. The samsung user have to keep the phone very close to the face to make himself audible. This is never the same in any other phone I have used so far. Is it this phone giving trouble or for all the samsung phone not sure, but experience is terrible with this so far.

"
"

  Review after 15 days of use.1.Finger print is slow2. camera is ok, not so good according to brand and price.3. Fast charging not at all working. takes 2.5 hours to charge mobile.4. Network reception is low.

"
"

  I am using since one month .Fingerprint reader is smooth and fast response.Battery life is very goodCamera quality is very good .Phone weight is some more high compared to other mobiles because of battery.Best for midrange budget phone.Fast charging and reasonable price.Very good display

"
"

  Phone hangs a lot while using basic everyday apps. Mentioned as fast charging but i didn't find any difference between ordinary mobile charging and this one. Only plus point is the cost which is offered for 6GB/128GB model. Switched back to Samsung due to #boycottChina movement.

"
"

  Best budget phone with excellent features. Excellent battery life, camera quality, screen size and premium quality phone in your budget. Go for it.üëçüëçüëç

"
"

  Great phone.. Battery backup is the best part, you can use it for complete 2 days in more than mild usage, and if you play pubg 2-3 hours a day, you can use it for a day and a half.Camera quality could've been better but it's good.Overall I loved the product and provides total value for money.

"
"

  The battery is just marvelous  at this price range it stays upto 2 day of a full charge.  The 48 mp camera has more details that any other brands 48 mp camera. It click photos about 12 to 16 mb sized. The super amoled display of this phone is really beautiful. Overall Samsung  did a good job by making this phone at this price range.

"
"

  Camera,battery life is good but some mobile networks covering is too poor.

"
"

  On the 7th day the phone had gone blank. After checking from the authorized Samsung service center, they said that the motherboard needs to be replaced. My first bad experience with Amazon. The question is, is it fault of the electronic item, or the seller knowingly sold a faulty product...

"
"

  Battery life is 36 hours with 4G network after charging. There is no lag and photo quality of the camera is good as compared to its competitors within same price range.I bought this mobile at 13k.

"
"

  ¬†Nice product from samsung, featuring all the essential things in one package, and more.Battery life is great, Amoled  screen is awesome, camera performance is very good in low light also.Purchased it in june 2020, one of the best budget phones which is not built by China.Thumbs Up.

"
"

  Excellent device under 15k budget. Two problem noticed from from the first moment......no.1 is heating issue due to video call within very few seconds & while you download something.....no.2 is backside is very cheap quality......I don't how the scratches has been placed within 2hours from the opening box

"
"

  this phone Samsung m21 starts malfunctioning within 15 days of usage. touch wasn't working and there was also problem in audio quality through call receiver. Samsung phones especially the budget one are not worth buying.

"
"

  It comes with very budget friendly price with it's best features.Very good camera quality.U cut screen,display looks awesome.Like this phone so much..Thanks to Sumsung & amazon for this good packaging & delivery.I recommend all to buy this ohone without thinking twice...Happy me.

"
"

  Major Problems- Camera is not so much clear as per 48 MP. Sometimes we are not able to outgoing calls then we have to restart the phone then we able to outgoing calls to others.Minor Problems- Sometimes Battery not charging well and sometimes charges well and fast. Sometimes phone not read fingerprint.

"
"

  This phone is good but i face some frame skipping in the slow-motion videos on 120 fps and also on 960 fps but over all its a very good phone.

"
"

  Battery backup not up to mark .It just like a only 4000 mah .Not working properly while using on hand free mode .I am very disappointed with Samsung once again.

"
"

  Good choice.....really satisfied....amazing features in affordable price...actually I cancelled the order of m11 & just by spending  2500rs more I got this superb m21...I will suggest m21 to those who want features like 6Gb/128gb/triple camera/sAmoled FHD+ infinity O/6000mah/nice _exynos 9611,etc in just around 15000

"
"

  When I was Installing  the applications in the phone, it was not happening, then I went to the Play Store settings and checked Play Protection Certificate ... it is written that "" Device is not Certified "" .Please Help üòëüôè

"
"

  Don't buy. In first month of purchase display  stopped working. I visited care center and they said we have updated your software. Now display is showing only two colours pink and blue only. Now service center says this repair will be paid as its internal damage But my phone neither falls nor its display is cracked.

"
"

  Im using this priduct for 2 months ,It had a massive battery life ,good camera,nice performance and excellentdisplay.But back side not looks so good.The samoled display which Samsung provided is top noche and the best in segment the procdssor 9611 is an alrounder.In one sentence this phone is jack of alternates and master of non.

"
"

  Except the camera which works as per the expectation. Rest all features are pretty average. For example fingerprint response is not that fast. But then samsung is not known for additional features. Only good thing is it has better RAM and storage in that price range.

"
"

  Superb phone with awesomegame experience and camera quality. It also supports pubg in HDR graphics. But after playing for 1 hour it heats up and causes choppiness which is the only problem i found in this phone. Its AMOLED screen is super sensitive and great quality. Its camera can also make 4k videos.

"
"

  Overall  the phone is very niceLiked below:Best battery lifeGood camera qualityAmazing screen oled displayMany default  Samsung  apps supportRoom for improvement:Speaker should have been on topShould  have been  on screen  fingerprint reader instead of back.

"
"

  Camera sucks. I expected 48MP Camera to be atleast be able to take regular photos with some details. May be camera software is bad I don't know it just sucks. On the hand a full charge will get you through one full day with 20% remaining. Fingerprint sensor is just average nothing very impressive. Love the screen quality though.

"
"

  I got the said product late and due to the prevention in Corona I opened the packet after five days. Product is in good condition.,but found defective in charging.  It has defective charging connector of phone. And I want the replacement.

"
"

  This product is very reliable & its battery life is  very much impressive. Back camera is perfect in this range but front camera is little disturbing like quality of image is not adequate. When data turn on immediate after opening chrome is take sometime to respond otherwise I will minimize it & restart the chrome then it is okay.

"
"

  ¬†This phone is the best smartphone in this price range. I had bought this phone on 17th of july.I am so much happy about it battery performance. This phone give a much battery backup for playing game.I had loved this,But i wished to get a more features in night mode in camera.

"
"

  My review after 2 weeks useCamera quality: back camera is nice but selfie camera not that goodBattery: it is 6000mh but not feels like 6000mhAudio and video: it as a very loud volume and video colours are also goodPerformance: I would say good performance  there is no lag till now

"
"

  M21 has got powerful battery giving longer usage without searching for power points..It has such a great camera with pictures of good quality is captured for great memories...slightly lagging at points though great for me at this price point.

"
"

  Ohh my god really this is awsome one...very good camere quality even at dark room...samsung is a samsung...this is my 3rd samsung mobile...i love samsung series...if u wanna go to buy samsung mobile just go for STPL seller in AMAZON...they never dissappoint their customer...many mobiles go and come but samsung is a permanent one..

"
"

  I received the phone -1. In completely proper condition2. Within the desired time.The phone has Very nice specifications. It has a very nice functioning,High speed and the fingerprint sensor and face id work very effectively, it has very nice camera. Overall it's an outstanding phine within the budget

"
"

  Display is too good.Camera is also fine for this price.Battery backup is good.OneUi 2.0 is cool.I got latest security patch( july 1 ) via update .Performance is better, and didn't face any hanging or lagging probelms after one month of usage.Overall great experience with my first Samsung phone .

"
"

  houses the selfie camera and a tiny earpiece right above it. You can reach the top of the display if you have big hands, else you'll need to shuffle a little to reach the top. However, this phone isn't as big as the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, which we recently reviewed.  The dewdrop notch houses the 20-megapixel selfie shooter  We also

"
"

  Display is one of the best in this price point,camara is above average.fingerprint is super fast. Pumpup by massive 6000mah which gives a 1and half day easily. Processor is exynos 9611 snappy fill like a51..ya but one down point is inbox charger is little bit slow it takes 2 hours to charg it up.thats it recommended for mid user.

"
"

  Product is very good. Only I saw issue regarding internet speed which is very low, as same operators sim card showing different speed in different phone at same place... How is it possible??? So I have doubt on this phone has some problem regarding internet speed even after using sim card in slot no 1

"
"

  Samsung M21 has a better camera quality than my previous Samsung J7 Duo.With moderate use the battery once charged upto 95 to 100 lasts for 2 days before needing the charge.Since M21 is narrower and longer than J7 Duo, it takes a bit of time getting used to handling the phone.

"
"

  The Samsung displays are excellent and even the phone built(screen+body) are best but the OS is not that good. Ram management and memory allocation are not that good.Overall for average users its a good phone though not recommended for heavy users(like games)

  SAB KO LEKE ANE WALA GANGSTER HOTA HAIAKELA ANEWALA MONSTER HOTHA HAI.KGF MOVIE DIALOGUE SUITS TO SAMSUNG.REALLY A BEAUTY THING IT IS IN THIS BUDGET OR IN THIS LINE OF PRODUCT.WHATTY CAMERA,  MONSTER BATTERY, ALMIGHTY PERFORMANCE.REALLY I LIKE MY NEW BUDDY

"
"

  This is very very bad üëé product. Within 10 day's it's display gone. It's still have wranty periods but Samsung care didn't help me. They forced me to buy insurance.My suggestion don't go for it.

"
"

  Best smartphone under 15,000 and I found some minor lags but it does not matter  its gives some of flagship experience its function are too good I recomend this smartphone to every person who is looking to buy best smartphone under 15,000. And this smartphone is really good, And I am an samsung fan.

"
"

  Mobile Is Good.I purchased it from Amazon with no cost EMI with HDFC debit card. (EMI - 2333.33/-)But bank will charged there charges.Now I am paying EMI is 2695/-..So so so bad experience with no cost EMI...

"
"

  Well, this Samsung M21 prety good look and when I am unlocking the phone through fingerprint reader quick accessing getting, battery life also comes for at least two days, camera quality very nice but one of the problems I have faced keyboard is not working  some times. Why, I don't know apart from this issue everything is fine.

"
"

  It's very good quality mobile and good faster courier service..

"
"

  Processor is good enough,  there is no lag while playing games.Camera is good enough to catch beautiful pictures.Display and build quality are too nice.Like the features included for one hand use.Battery life is not up to the mark and there is a small heating issue.Overall I could rate 4 out of 5.

"
"

  Its was an excellent product within the price range, enjoyed it... delivery was as expected which means it is an excellent performance

"
"

  Battery back up of the phn is very good..Screen is very smoothFinger print sensor is also nice..But I'm not happy with the camera quality of the phn coz it looks like uncleaan after clicking picturesAny how..it is good phn under the price.

  The product is very good at this price point , You can play PUBG at Smooth Setting at 40 to 50 FPS without any frame drops but as soon as device heatup it have some frame drops.But as promised by the manudacturer that PUBG at high setting but it cant play it at High setting. You can record gameplay also of pubg very smoothly .

  Inbuilt screenshot systems should have proper and easy methodology instead present palm swipe which is disgusting, fingerprint has some delay for quick sensing, Software to be more meaningful and friendly understandable at some level,  future updates to take note of this.

"
"

  I was playing pubg at the moment..and suddenly the screen got a crack in it ...and I really disappointed  by this incident......and I have been trying to contact Amazon customers service for 2 days.......I can't  understand  that the phone really contain gorilla glass 2....I request to repair it in warranty period or....for a return

"
"

  Those who have bought this phone should take extream care.Even a slighest fall would damege the display.Even when there is not even a scrach out side the display get dameged by spreading the ink inside that screan and they won't give any warranty for that.To repare that screan we loose 5500 RS.Within one month I lost 5500 RS!!

"
"

  I bought it recently and it's amazing,I am switching from redmi to Samsung and my experience is surprisingly amazing.Camara and battery is extra ordinary.Software is very smooth ,And i getting new feature like 'single take' and 'ar zone' in camera through last update and i am happy with it.

"
"

  I am like very much service of Amazon India. Samsung brand actually now done very good work in budget category phone. Phone look, camera, display, battery, UI 2.0 etc very super and seamless experience.Thanks.

"
"

  THE WORST SUPPORT BY AMAZON AND THE SELLER. THEY ARE SELLING FAKE DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS AND NOT HELPING THE CUSTOMERS AT ALL. THE SELLER DOESNT RESPOND. THE PHONE HEATS LIKE IT IS IN OVEN AND THE VOICE QUALITY IS HORRIBLE. NEVER EVER BUY THIS PHONE FROM THE SELLER.I HATE THE SELLER AND ALSO AMAZON

"
"

  Great phone for a reasonable price, and display is worth mentioning from Samsung. I recommend it for anyone for a casual smartphone experience - checkout for newer models of the same series. Battery life is great, have a solid large one, bit heavy if you call it using it - worth any way.

"
"

  Overall phone is very good in this budget  with monster battery, good camera and super Amoled display with full HD + display, and Dolby atmos sound in earphone is very  crystal clear and relaxing.Only one thing  need to be improved default app lock is not available  .I request to Samsung  to give  S secure or other default app lock feature.

"
"

  Monster battery 6000 MAh and fast charging. Rubbish. Charging time around 4 hrs and battery draining within few hours if you are using it. Really very very bad and poor performance, not recommending to anyone and don't waste your hard earned money for this fake battery built in mobile.

"
"

  Mobile is gud for wat its priced ..yet camera quality could hav improved ,lags in taking shots ,not very good for games lags lot wit online gamesCan definitely go for it in this price range and more over it's not from China tats d big reason to buy at this price range

"
"

  ¬†Awesome phone.... You will forget to use realme ,oppo, vivo after using this phone ... one of the best operating system ... super fast... awsome camera especially night mode is quite impressive..Processor is too good for gaming.Unbeliveable display at this price range.

"
"

  Issues with the camera glass..i have got a broken glass at the corner of my camera glasses..damaged one..Customer care isnt supportive..i have been waiting on call for more than 30 mins..still it hasnt connected...worst

"
"

  I have purchased this on 15th may.Just wow for Samsung...a great phone...Better experience other than chinese phones...Completely made in Noida(India)..just go for it. you won't disappoint. The battery is really a monster..Finger unlock, touch and all features works well.

"
"

  1.If you want a phone with incredible display and  good battery life it's the one.2. Processor is not that good but does its job3. Camera is average, auto focus is slow4. Charge time is 2:30 hrs, but its ok for a  6000mah battery5. Gaming is not that good when compared to sd  processor

"
"

  After using this phone for a month here r my reviews. The camera and screen are the best features of the phone where battery is also not so bad (could have been better). What can disappoint u a bit is its fingerprint sensor but with this price I think this phone is worth it.I personally feel satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Totally satisfied  with my purchase ,firstly  I was afraid whether there is any issue of network  with this phone bt after delivery  it is really osm with nice features, it is really  cool device.

"
"

  Very happy with M21 since long time I got good phone in reasonable cost.Smooth to handleCamera features are fantasticBattery backup longerFingerprints quick worksSafe because not Chinese company

"
"

  Performance  is not good .In this prize segment  other brand have better performance. Networks  issue is also here .Though this phone have 6000mah battery  but it is not up to mark .realme 5000 mah battery  is better than this ..This phone not have inbuilt  internet speed meter .

"
"

  The fingerprint reader is very accurate and fast. The 6000mAh battery allows me to charge only once per day to my device and act like a mini power bank. The camera quality is high and good. The front 20MP camera gives good shots for selfie lovers. The sAmoled screen gives good viewing experience for movie lovers.

"
"

  As a computer professional  I am focusing always on technical details. This phone from Samsung contains all the feature needed by mobile user with excellent speed of processor and smart Featured camera with brilliant display accompany by heavy duty battery life...Feeling Happy to have Galaxy M21.BEST PHONE IN BUDGET PRICE.

"
"

  Camera is just ok not that good as expected and explained.Battery too drains very fast even while using simple apps. and fast charging is just for name,it takes normal time to get full charge.i will rate this phone 2.5 on scale of 5!!Even the charger has stopped working within less then 1 month time of purchase!!

"
"

  Very Good phone at this range and performance is very good. One should have this phone . It's not a Chinese product and also very good camera, battery.

"
"

  Best phone under 13k if you don't want hard gaming on it.....Best displayGreat batteryNice cameraBest selfi camBest for day to day taskDolby AtmosSamsung UIConsPolycarbonate bodySlow charging speedBack cover or screen gaurd not included in box

"
"

  obviously the most powerfull feature is the camera quality. For students like us who are preparing for competitions from home need a monster battery and this is a complete pakage. camera is ossm and all i can is is that Samsungs this series is not gonna disappoint anyone for sure and at last thanks to amazon for their service in harsh quarantine

"
"

  phone is actually amazing specifically camera and its functions like slow motion, hyperlapse & AR too. Speaker is also good and display is bit big but very flat and charming.

"
"

  overall all functionality is good. the camera is awesome and touch is good. look is also good. only as per my expectation it's a little less slim and as they say the battery is not working as 6000mh. as per the other phone, it's working one day. i bought it in a replacement offer so it's fine to me.

"
"

  Screen display is very weak, it will break easily.After 30 days charger works slow,and charging takes lot of time.Spend money wisely, use any brands phone made in India. No brand specific

"
"

  brilliant camera and processor and display..functioning is fast..battery is ok ok for its 6000mh specsuperslow motion option is good...overall one can go for this without second thought...

"
"

  This phone is so niceI have Samsung galaxy M30s too and both are doing LITIf you are planning to buy this one then go for it

"
"

  Everything is good about the phone, but It has 2 defects 1. The charging is too slow and 2. Phone heating problem. I need to be on calls for long hours and heating is being an issue for me.

"
"

  Gifted this phone to mom. And she absolutely loved it. The phones under budget and bundled with features. The camera especially is the highlight.

"
"

  The look is awesome and attractive and the finger print reader is best it unlocks in not more than 1 sec.....And the face unlock us quiet good.. in 2-3 sec it unlocks the phone.And the battery backup is awesome it has 2 days battery backup.. and the dolby atmos is also good it has clear sound effects in gaming..

"
"

  Well I need a phone which can last upto a long time without charging the phone again and again but with it's 6000 mAh battery it totally met my requirements.The Camera quality is excellent and all the basic functioning in this phone is quite impressing. Overall for those who are quite depressed with their old phone,this phone worth a shot.

"
"

  Good phone for regular use.1. The battery life is awesome, can easily last 1.5 day for moderate users.2. Display is very good off course because of SuperAMOLED display.3. Carmera quality is is immersive captures perfect images for all types of uses.In short best phone in this price range.

"
"

  Frequently caller voice breakup it ups and downs. The sound is not clear and when I called the person they said your voice is not coming when I use the same sim in different phones is working well. it a bad experience with Samsung.I request to amazon kindly replace my phone. Hope they will do for me.

"
"

  Its battery life is too good . And there is also an option named ""fast charging"" which is found in very less smartphones and its a very good feature. Moreover, the camera is also good and realistic too. Awesome phone thanks for Samsung for making such a great piece and also Amazon for making it available online.

"
"

  Nice mobile with exellent battery back up at this range.. useful for students who are constantly using mobile for online class it has terrific display.. no hanging and that sort of issues.. easy to use.. camera quality of 48mp which is exellent And the fingerprint reader has quick response.. it is so cool to use

"
"

  The Best budget mobile and fingerprint working fast without any delay, the battery is the most üí•üî•üî• advantage  ofthe mobile  ,battery backup upto 2 days without internet always on ,if its on nothing bad still backup upto 1nd1/2 days.And the camera quality is awesome particularly the ultrawide is amazing.

"
"

  Amazon service and products seem to have gone down the drains. Received a brand mobile phone but the adapter does not work.

"
"

  Bought this phone for my mother. But experiencing very slow network speed despite using 4G sim. The same sim had very good network speed when using a low end NOKIA 4G phone. Without high data speed its 75% useless.

"
"

  I my perception there is no any dislikes for this mobile.All are good,mostly the camera,the photos and videos are awesome.And comming to performance,thanks to samsung Exynos processor.And finally the battery,there is nothing to tell about battery performance you need to experience it.

"
"

  Guys never buy this phone especially from Amazon.  After 4 days of use it start hanging and restarting automatically, once I called to customer  care and try to replace it simply they are denied. What is the meaning of 10 days replacement they have mentioned. They are waiting to cheat you ... never trust on them

"
"

  This is the best budget phone till date. Samsung is far better than chinese craps. Just go for it without any second thought.

"
"

  After 20 days of usage I can say that the mobile phone is good,the quality of camera is average(for mid-range),figerprint scanner is decent,dispaly is nice..I am recommending this mobile phone for normal usage not for gaming you can use it for small games but not for high end games..overall is good

"
"

  Everything is beyond expectation but only problem is as always data cable , again in this model also it has stopped charging and I had to buy another cable. Other than this it's recommended

"
"

  Don't buy this mob on Amazon...I have recieved failure product...Sim not detected issues faced.. Amazon customer care not proper respons... and not taking replacement.... so friends dont buy for this product in Amazon.... very worst .... if you need any clarity replay me...

"
"

  I bought it one week ago.. looking good.....Battery backup is awesome....Handling of phone also excellent..Only thing I dis appointed with it has no flash light on front... but display light is  blinking while taking photos and looking goodThanks to Amazon for delivering a good product

"
"

  Very good cellphone for all kind of users.it has very good touch good display and camara quality is good. It has very good design and lots of specifications.It has good fingerprints reader good camara quality and long battery life.

"
"

  Very bad experience for me.Heating issues and restart issues. Whennm we charge time taken more than 2Hr. I am very disappointed. Please don't buy this M21. I am keep calling stupid Amazon team they force me to use Samsung brand. I am very disappointed amazon team activity. I am unhappy.

"
"

  Not that much good in this price range..Fingerprit issues most of the times..Camera quality f Ot up to the mark as it is 48 mp..Battery seems ok..Not excellent..I regret a little that I could purchase Mi note 8 pro..

"
"

  Talking about camera it's best in class.Long battery life.Fingerprint scanner: need to place finger properly I think it didn't recognize partially placed finger.Overall it's very good phone.Big screen, smooth touch, fast processing.

"
"

  Phone is beautiful and sleek but Its sim slots are defective, when I insert same sim on my old phone it works but on this it does not detect sim on both the slot. Return and Replacement policy is not straight forward and difficult.

"
"

  I bought this mobile due to touch screen problem, üîã is not charged fastly in switch off mode, it tooks almost 3hrs for full charging.It's having quad core processor but work is not up to that mark.After replacement also we faced same issues, finally o got refund..Thank you amazon team..

"
"

  Best phone at this price. Better than Chinese phone like MI, Realme,Oppo, Vivo. Avoid Chinese products.

"
"

  Good battery  back upSuper screenFingerprint very quicklyFast chargerAsome phone  6 GB 128 GB asp rs.14999Great priceAll doneOnly charger cable is small

"
"

  Thanks to amazon and thanks to retailer for a fantastic  product at a lowest  market price, i ordered 6 gb ram and 4 gb ram, believe  both are fantastic mobile, main thing is battery  and rear camera, thanks amazo

"
"

  I am very happy with the phone, it is sturdy and robust, the look and feel of the phone is great and impressive. I am happy to have made this purchase. I will be making another purchase of the same phone during any sale in future.

"
"

  The product is really good in this price...The back body of phone is made of plastic, so you should also order one back cover for mobile

"
"

  The phone is good. Camera quality is superb. Only disappointment is the battery life. Although having a 6000 mah battery, it will not last a complete day with moderate usage.The fast charger is also not that fast. It takes about 3+ hrs for full charging.

"
"

  Reviewing it after 4 Months of use.This phone is outstanding. Performance is really good. The best thing is the battery life. I use it roughly n it really gives me good backup. Fingerprint sometimes doesn't approves if you have moisture or water on your finger rest it's response is all good.

"
"

  All feacher of phone awesome. Camara is awesome.the quality of Camara in night mode is very nice.all over the phone is a nice device that is fulfilled your acceptation  for a mobile phone. I like it. Nice phone.fingerprit reader is ok,very sensitive. Battery life is for 2day sufficient.

"
"

  Amoled display experience like never before. Premium look in this budget section.. best budget mobile in India.I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Great one, my rating is more than 5star, thanks to Samsung n Amazon.

"
"

  Good phone with heating up problem during charging.No fast charge.Cameras are not upto the mark.Review after 3 weeks.Display  superb.Touchscreen superb.

"
"

  Excellent mobile with best price. Love it

"
"

  The product worked fine at the beginning, but after two weeks ,the sim slot stopped working.Both the sim slots do not read the sim.Double checked the sim cards,but were working fine in other phones.

"
"

  Not active for application security related,Application lock not provided in this device,Fingerprint not proper & smoothly working.So please improve & provide this functionality.Charging time very heated mobile.

"
"

  So, I am using Samsung's galaxy  m21 form last 2 weeks and i can say that it's  the best smart phone under mid range,it have probably every thing from awesome camera to samoled display,with a monster battery ,if you want to have a genuine phone with a trusted brand than you can surely go for it indeed, thankyou.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy M21 is a wonderful features mobile phone. Camera quality and Battery life Super Amoled led display totally superb üëåüëåüëå

"
"

  Although delivery was late and its completely acceptable , but regarding product it's quite nice and smooth you will really love it once u unbox it's like awesome camera feature and nice look gives edge over other product of same cost range I love it and I would recommended everyone to go for samsung product

"
"

  Specs are exactly as given in the description. Looks good, feels good. Camera is okay. If you're not specifically looking for a camera phone, then go for it. Worth all the money.

"
"

  Im bought this mobile 2 weeks before. But this mobile has very worst performance. The mobile over heat in the board side. Figure print and face deduction option not wel and touch is not working well if I touch any option in the mobile corner side it not responding well . BAD BAD CHOICEWORST SAMSUNG PRODUCT

"
"

  It's been 2 months since I bought this phone and it stands strong to its name ""Monster"". Monstrous Battery and Samoled display of Samsung never fails to provide the best of experience. With the new update Single Take option is also includes and various camera features make more competitive in this price range.

"
"

  A super budget phone, awesome performance, awesome look handy filling to lightweight. Thanks Samsung from m21 and thanks to amazon.

"
"

  It was a best deal in the market for 12699.This is a good phone, but not satisfy with camera.Budget Friendly for mid range.Hope so for good review I have to use more and judge it.Thank You

"
"

  Writing this review after 1month of heavy usage.1. Both rear and front camera are excellent.2. Display quality is super.3. Battery performance is top class.4.I play freefire daily for many hours with ultra graphics without any lag5. Totally a worth of money.6. Be honest must buy this phone.

"
"

  Network Issues, no range a to all , other mobile capturing good range, but this one not capturing single tower, don't fool customers, Third class product from Samsung, also display brightness is very low..I have bought 2 mobiles, unable to return only replacement..zero Stars for this M21 and M31.

"
"

  Already one time replacement was done. Screen is not working properly. Voice problem is also there. Strongly not recommended to purchase and worst service ever from Samsung.Checked with service center and spare parts are also not available in market.

"
"

  Hand Set..... Nice..Performance... Amazing.Camera.. Great..Battery ... Full Charge.. 2 days working.. really good.

"
"

  Phone is very slow.....It feels like always lagging and that's because of the exynos processor.Samsung must provide snapdragon....every thing else is up to the mark.....I would suggest to go for moto 1 fusion plus

"
"

  Everything is wonderful. Blue colour look Beautiful... but when you use camera, It heats up a lot only around camera part.

"
"

  The  charger is as waste as the phone is good. They are opposite  of each other. Quality  of charger  is not  at all  good

"
"

  Display is amazing and One UI is the best UI I've used so far. It's light and highly customisable. Multitasking is decent sometimes it gets stuck but that's rare. Camera is good especially daylight pics are perfect. You'll never have to worry about battery when using this phone. Overall a really good phone for daily use.

"
"

  With in week after purchasing thereis battery charging problem, when I consult to Samsung customer he told battery problem will be not included in the warranty as there may be moisture went inside the charging port, so you have to pay for it.And one more problem is that phone heat very much with in 4-5 minutes of use.

"
"

  From very long time i use mi phones but after thinking too many days i finally choose m21 and this is best decision i make.Display-10/10Battery-10/10Camera-8/10Sound-7/10Processor-9/10 no any lags i feel best processor under 15kBut if u wanna buy samsung phones then buy minimum 6gb ram

"
"

  Finger print reader is super fast....Battery life is long lasting and camera quality is appropriate....!!!Its worth for the price..It has amazing features..Dark mode is super sexy..!!!The face unlock is very adaptable...And has amazing UI. ( User interface)Games run super smooth.

"
"

  Great product with awesome fingerprint quality, strong battery life but slightly beats while charging. The camera quality is marvelous. Only while zooming in pixels are not so helpful to keep the image without pigmented capture.Overall I would say it's a cool product worthy of the price 15999 (when I purchased it).

"
"

  Phone is pretty good. Battery and camera are great. Nice features. No hanging or anything after usage for a few weeks.

"
"

  Display is awesome, it‚Äôs a little bit thick, camera is not very good but for daily uses it is good, battery life is again very nice

"
"

  Best mobile under 15k, I am fully satisfied from the product.Awesome camera, awesome fingerprint sensor and the biggest battery with a beautiful amoled screen.Best mobile with great features by Samsung.Nothing can compete with this in this segment.

"
"

  There is excessive heating during call receive, charging mobile and surfing internet. Volume quality is also not adequate. I try to return it but help line was so busy & I could not connect with them. Although screen & picture quality is good. Earlier I was using Galaxy On Max & performance after 3 years it is still fine.

"
"

  Nice device for anybody but gamers. Display is good and not to big , device is light weighted so handy to use . Camera quality also good charging is good not as slow as told in many reviews .Overall good purchase and I am satisfied.Camera quality not too goodSelfie is better than most phones

"
"

  The product is very good and this phone is very attractive colour and the quality of camera features is very different and battery life is very good and the fingerprint system is very interesting and many apps are giving by branding just like,candy crush ,likee,Netflix are giving by Samsung authorities I love this phone

"
"

  Fingerprint quality is essential for keep safe ur mobile and this phone have very accurate fingerprint and also facelock ,it battery life is about 10 to 12 hours with watching videos and songs with an awesome quality of camera just like a professional camera.And finally all this is in very low cost compared to others.

"
"

  The phone is a complete ""pauisa vasul"" deal. The best thing about it is the battery life and 48MP Primary rear camera. Fingerprint sensor and face detection are faster than your expectation. Equipped with 6 GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage the phone gives you the best user experience. Having this phone is phone is a must.

"
"

  Best budget mobile by Samsung it is. Even I think that it's better than M31. Because it has almost all features of M31 despite camera but still it's camera is equivalent of M31.Greatttttttt. Device by Samsung.Keep it up Samsung I am big fan of your products and hope that you will bring us new device like M21...

"
"

  Great budget  phone and service provided by Amazon is appreciable.First phone that I got delivered was exchanged with no time as it got little scratch  on the screen.I am very happy with amazon services as well as Samsung.

"
"

  Camera is quite good. Phone is good in terms of storage, camera and battery backup. Little heavy on hands but the fact that battery is good is because it has heavy batteries. Display is wonderful.

"
"

  The phone is very good, battery consumption 60% after full day use with internet. Good battery performance. Camery of the samaung is always good. Under 15000 it is best phone to purchase.

"
"

  Exynos is sluggy as compared to Snapdragon chipset in respect to processing and performance.Display is wow. Do not expect for gaming (its ok- ok, not for heavy duty like pubg mobile).For long battery life its better, not best. Fir normal use its a win-win.Samsung UI is descent.

"
"

  Im writing this review after having used the phone for a couple of months now. It is superb. Long battery life helps me go more than a day. Seamless video views. Long youtube videos and online meetings. All go through at ease throughout the day. Really a superb phone. Must have. Pocket friendly.

"
"

  Samsung is really coming with great phones under all ranges.  Bought this phone and giving this review after using for 5 days.  It works really smooth.  Camera quality is class apart.  Really happy with the phone

"
"

  This phone is not provide any security option like Samsung Knox . This is the major problem that I faced.Without any security the phone is no more smart . it's only a box of 6.4""Hardware is quite good

"
"

  I like to Battery life.6000mh....display....and samsung brand values.. looking gyd but....back pannel is very cheapest ,weight distribution is very gyd,fingerprint is gyd not faster or not slow,camera quality is very good in day light but in low light it give poor result,......and Amazon is very gyd service...fast service secure service...

"
"

  I've  already contact u regarding the performance of this phone , I've called twice , and one executive told me to do some operations like resetting and all and  did that now it's fine,  and if the problem still arises after some days how can I return the product

"
"

  My openion  It's low quality's phone Samsung ""M"" Series I think ""A"" series better than M series coz A series Everything is good With quality but M series battery also not Good camera 48 megapixel not good fingerprint ok display ok most one think important topic M21 phones material are fully low-quality phone looking  Average

"
"

  Very nice product more than expected features which gives 6000mAh battery lasts more than a day HD videos look very great and even sAmoled screen helps to look colour of movies in 720p very great never seen this in any of the samsung products before. The fingerprint reader read very quickly faster than any other phones.

"
"

  I PURCHASED SAMSUNG GALAXY M21, ON 18-MAY-2020, THE DELIVERY WAS WITHIN TIME. AFTER RECEIVING THE PRODUCT SICE LAST 5DAYS. ITS BATTERY LIFE IS REALLY AWESOME. CAMERA QUALITY IN DAYLIGHT IS  SO REALISTIC WITH TRUE COLOUR.  AND SUPER AMOLED SCREEN DISPLAY IS PRETTY COOL.ONE THING I WANT TO SAY THIS PRODUCT IS MANUFACTURED IN INDIA.

"
"

  Wowwww.... Watta Amazing Cellphone by Samsung..... I really loved it...‚ù§ Must buy...Best cellphone in this price range.. ""battery life"".. ""Fingerprint Reader"".. ""Camera Quality"" is just  superb.... it's not heavy and bulky like redmi cellphones, Watta Display.... just superb cellphones guyz... Grab it!

"
"

  ""Build quality is poor and can get scratchs easily on back panel and camara quality was not upto the mark"" only this is the drawback of this phone and all remaining thing like display, battery performance, fingerprint reader, speakers, and power and performance of this phone is excellent in this price range.

"
"

  Excellent mobile in this budget Rs 12699/. Camera quality is excellent. Battery backup is 6000mah is outstanding.  Sound quality and s amoled display is crystal clear. It supports Dolby Atmos technology makes it valuable mobile.  Finally in this budget, Samsung Galaxy m21 is excellent in every specification.

"
"

  Pros: 1.display  2.Battery life  3.Camera in daylight takes some amazing picturesCons: 1. Slow charging  2.Camera lags in low light situations  3.Fingerprint and faceunlock is slow compared to the competition

"
"

  Using mobile from last 2 months.Just ok. Battery is taking 3 hrs to charge but discharging in half day. Camera is like 12mp not like 48mp. Finger print is below avg. Some times mobile becomes un responsive. For normal users it is ok. But for heavy users don't dare to buy it. Overall my rating  2.5/5

"
"

  Phone is looking good, after 15 days charging problem occurred.. Service centre treatment is very wory. Without diagnosis of phone told me your phone is water damaged while there is no contact of water droplets. I will never suggest to purchase Samsung phone.

"
"

  Phone was goodBut there was no back coverAnd i didn't got screen gaurd too

"
"

  As you know I bought a mobile phone Samsung galaxy M21 by Amazon. After one month I am facing a problem which is screen defect after that I complain to Samsung care and they are not considering my mobile phone under warranty.Please resolve this issue as soon as possible.and rewered to me regarding this issue.Thank

"
"

  Camera quality was not good, but after software update it becomes good and it's focusing problem is solved. Another problem is touchscreen- not working precisely. It seems to be a software problem. It should be fixed as early as possible.

"
"

  ""Battery life""..You can evalute battery life when you have full charging!!!I am not satified with the product just want to return it, everything is good(like camera, features, finger print) but just to get 90% charge in the phone it take not less than 6-7 hours which is not adjustable for any user I feel!!‚òπÔ∏è

"
"

  It‚Äôs a great phone at this price.After using it for 30 days, I haven‚Äôt found any issue in it till now. Works perfectly as advertised.Great battery backup. Good camera quality. Great processor.If you are looking for a budget phone, go for it.

"
"

  This is value for money product. Camera quality of phone is very good. But battery life is not too good it shows 6K mah but it hardly 14-15 hours on full using and even less if you use hotspot. This time i m doing study at home for which i need on hotsppt to connect Laptop doing this battery life is approximately 12 hours

"
"

  Wow i was looking for longer battery life with affordable price and this Samsung m21 satisfy me. Fingerprint reader also awsome. Its 128gb storage, 6gb ram, dolby atmos etc. wows me. And one thing that i like the most with samsung is its display quality. Being a super Amoled it is like a destiny. Its camera is nothing to say but wonderful.

"
"

  Amazon super fast delivery üëå. M21 best in this price range. S amoled is amazing. Light weight with 6000 betterry awesome engineering. Best deal under 15000 segment.

"
"

  The fact that it is so hassle free to buy is such a relief from all those flash sales. The performance in every front is top notch considering the price point. Special mention to the battery life it is just awesomeKudos to samsung for this availability.A perfect gift for your elders

"
"

  Today I got my first Samsung m21 , I bought this one after very much compared with the other phones, I really tell to all buyers that go for this one with close eyes, such a beautiful experience,  I also used the I phones but this one is such a monster in every segment, thanks Samsung and Amazon

  I like very much:1. First charging2. After attending and delivering online lecture for 2 hrs. charge of the battery remained 77%3. Picture of front and back camera satisfactoryNothing to dislike.

"
"

  Plus point1.Battery awesome2. Display good3. Ear speaker niceMinus Point1. Loud speaker is not OK..bcoz Very low sound....

"
"

  It's screen is too good. SAMOLED screen is really cool. It has blue light filter as well. It's battery is amazing.I gifted this phone to my mom. Only drawback is it's front camera, i.e. also not bad.It's UI is really cool. My mom is really happy with the phone. :)

"
"

  Very less camera  quality normal barrary life,Heating problems , some times hanging it was very shameful  for Samsung.  Very very slow mobile..

"
"

  Great package at this price with brand trust ,everything is great except battery. Not looks like fast  charging.you can go with these if your priority  is not gaming..superb phone for regular use with great samoled display.

"
"

  Excellent battery life and nice camera and finger print.

"
"

  I am giving this review after ten days of use1. The display of the phone is very nice2. Camera quality is excellent3. The best thing is the battery backup of the phone4. Fingerprint and face unlock are fairly goodOverall good product

"
"

  As I left Redmi & Vivo & PURCHASED Samsung M21 overall mobile is good.  Just only 7 days before I PURCHASED and hanging problems come also sometimes fingerprint not working in this new phone..I m very disappointed.Anyone can suggest how can I do for this issues..?Either overall phone good.

"
"

  48 mb camera image quality is good........Display is good......Touch mild slow .......Ok super.Head aech starting ..mAmazon nice delivery

"
"

  ¬†I have been using for last 10 days and its battery has 2-3 days backup and camera has fabulous features like  super slow motion and super steady recording upto 4k resolution.Its display is super crisp and clear, it is best phone in this price segment.

"
"

  This device is indeed a watta monster..This is what I call samsung at it's best.....The perfect Samsung's fast processor, 6000 maH more than enough battery power, 48 and 20 MP premium samsung camera.....It's a monster at a very low cost..Purchase it before it's too late..Thanks Samsung teamüòò

"
"

  Amazing phones in 15k budget... bought just 30days before and loving it in every possible way..Amazing camera.. Brilliant Super Amoled display...and a big battery life for 1.5 days for a non gamer like me....with so many awesome features...I will definitely recommend m21 if u r up for a budget phone in 14k...

"
"

  Good camera of 48 Mega pixels, Battery of 6000 Mili amp is enough .Best shots at this price. After all i have been using Samsung Exynos processors past 4 years without any lag.Gaming experience is also good

"
"

  I can buy this phone on may 2020 really really i like this phone battry life is best, my battry is work on 48hrCamera quality awsomeNice pictures viewAlmost 4k video will also playSound quality is best.5star for this phone great

"
"

  Made people fool by saying 48mp camera.It never takes picture like 48mp. There is 3:4 screen ratio( 12mp) which is as same as3:4(48mp) mode.  No difference in picture.In antutu also I checked, in camera it was not showing 48mp option.

"
"

  Good camera quality but disappointed by its fingerprint sensors sensing it doesn't allows easy  fingerprint captureIt has an extended battery life that is a good.But the USB cable was very short than expectedThe delivery was also late than expectedVery unuseful apps were pre installed in the phone that was not good

"
"

  I am a happy user of Samsung M21 it has a very fast sensitive fingerprint reader and about the battery very good battery after a heavy usage it will last for more than 35+ hours and the camera quality is very good and I should mention about its camera is very good for videography you can buy this product without any doubt

"
"

  Honest reviewNot a bad phoneEverything is grtCamera is normalBattery drains somewhatDoesn't get heatJust gets warm while charging or if u use it continuously for gaming and camera

"
"

  Left side of the display is completely bricked and now I am going to have to visit the support/service centre. Amazon also has reduced the return policy down from 14 days to 7 days now.

"
"

  Great product using since last 1 month.Good looking and battery backup is great. Over all a nice product under 15000. I have purchased it @12600 in big billion day sale.

"
"

  The phone is absolutely super.But has some problems fingerprint reading is slow, system settings are bit difficult to understand.Battery is excellent.amoled display works pretty well.Camera quality is best in classBut I hope it would be better if it has a factory cover case and and a tempered glass with it

"
"

  Battery,Camera,Display everything is great.Best phone at this price.Only issue is with charger it takes long time to get to 100%.Might be a faulty charger.Looking forward to getting it replaced at service centre.

"
"

  Pretty much nice product...  1.Display is lit..üëå  2.Battey backup is good.  3.Also not that no gaming in this phone..  2-3 hours of pubg,cod or any of the  today's popular game(u know) is fine.  4.Camera is also nice.All & all, a well to do all-rounder for every class of people.

"
"

  Cost is bit high. I had bought m21 on June 1st which was 12.5k and again I had bought the same on month end which was 14k. With 14k we could have bought 128gb/64MP mobiles. Same as usual mobiles this would come for 2 years hopefully. Then we tend to buy a new feature phone and I feel cost is the only cons.

"
"

  Bought this phone from Amazon sold by STPL Exclusive Online. Within one month of usage the phone stopped working.Neither Amazon nor STPL Exclusive Online taking any responsibility of this. Now this phone is piece of plastic worth nothing.Do not buy from Amazon/STPL Exclusive Online.

"
"

  Pros:Good camera, better battery life, decent displayCons:HOTSPOT NOT WORKING WITH LAPTOPS AND COMPUTERS (MOBILE TO MOBILE  WORKING FINE)Maybe need update frequency selection05/09/20After update in laptop & desktop drivers it's working fine ,we have to update driver software in laptop and desktop

"
"

  I like because of this is not a Chinese product.

"
"

  This product is absolutely super.. and especially battery life is soo good and no more words about diaplay and prossers is good for daily use but not that much good for pubg but u can play pubg in smooth and extreme with out any lags and frame drops.. and finally camera is pretty good... #BEST PRODUCT AT THIS PRICE RANGE

"
"

  I purchased samsung galaxy m21 of Debit card EMI facility of rs.2666.50 for 6 months. But today the entire amount of rs.15278 has been deducted from my account, although the amount again deposited to my account after the discussion with customer care. Hope this kind of harrassment will not be faced further

"
"

  Im writing this after using 2 weeks...Touch is not that smooth..Display is ok but not great..finger print reader lags a bit..Takes much time to charge..around 3 hours.

"
"

  Amezing product I like this video qulaty its amazing photo capture quality nice Solomotion nice work Al good battery long time display to good display size nice Video satable good all are nice

"
"

  First it was defective, battery fastly discharged,  asked for replacement, but they said service provider verification is there, later service provider not came, so they replaced item, which is working well. I m completely satisfied with this new one.

"
"

  Screen, battery, and UI are it's best sides. Safety is very good. No unnecessary ads and clean and feature rich UI.Design, strength and Camera is ok, though gaming experiance could have been better.Can't recommend for gaming but it is a good purchase for daily use smartphone needs..

"
"

  Screen touch is very good, camera quality is very good, nice storage, smoothly touch, faster amoled display procecer, sound quality is excellent in earphones,value for money, but its heavy phone and speakers only one noise is low, thanks Samsung.

"
"

  I feel really happy to say that I had recieved  very good  product galaxy M21 it has long Time battery , smooth soft fast touch ,clarity of camera and it's look beautifully attractive  thank you  so much and I must say u had done a very good job  I had recieved  a very good delivery  service  by following social  distance

"
"

  Phone jack is not working, headphones not detecting, with headphones opposite person not able to here when give a call.Jack issue.Disappointed.

"
"

  The Mobile is not bad for normal daily usual use but charger is defective. after 20 days of use the charger is not working properly fast charging. it is charge very slow. its take lot of time to full charge and now after the replacement time is over it can not replace. now I am totally disappointed for this of Amazon.

"
"

  Worst phone I ever purchased.completely disappointed by finger print sensor.it is waste not working properly.even low budget phone like Redmi 8 also working nicely.this Samsung phone completely waste for money.don't buy this phone. Don't buy Samsung.cheater

"
"

  Camera quality is good but night mode is  not up to the mark.Face recognition is not fast and most of the time we have to use fingerprint sensor.Battery is not as expected. For 6000mah it is not long lasting. It drains quickly if we play games.Processor can't handle games. It is ok for normal usage.

"
"

  It awesome mobile but some factor may affect rating such as camera quality is not self beautyfy feature  unlike oppo n vivo phone andin voice quality there is little beat noise otherwise everything was excellent üòä.thanks to amzaon to deliver this product before expected delivery date..

"
"

  Processing, touch, fingerprint reader, application etc all are fine... its heavier product if you use chinese phones...üòÇüòÇüòÇBattery is draining somewhat faster...may be beacuse of rigorous use...üòú... satisfied with product in this price... sharing this feedback after 10 days of use...

"
"

  Definitely a monster.Great battery life smoothly works a day and a half. Canera is amazing with many modes. Great connectivity . Almost using this monster about 2 months now and faced Literally no problems.Recommend this device to everyone.if u have a mid rage budged definitely buy this .Super cool.

"
"

  Product is good, Only thing is I don't see any difference between M30s, M30 and M21. All are same products with different model names. There must be some difference but i didn't see it.. the view of M21 is all oike M31s, both front and rear view.

"
"

  I have used Samsung, right from before. I had quite if's and but's, I should buy or not, but I must say, this is the best phone ever, that too in budget. Just charge it once, use it whole day. No need to put on charging more than once. Battery life is awesome, camera, fingerprint sensor, everything is damn good. Really a monstrous phone.

"
"

  For non gaming users, this phobe is just perfect for everyday use and binge watching. The camera was lagging but after the recent software update our for solved. Camera is decent. Not that good in low light but in daylight it may defeat dslrs. Depth analysis is of OK type. Display is awesome.

"
"

  Jst brilliant..best budget phone ever...must buy.forget Chinese phonesMonstrous battery.Awesome display.Marvelous cameraProud to be a SAMSUNGian!!!!

"
"

  6 GB RAM is sufficient for a normal use as well as for having a great Gaming experience. 128 GB inbuilt storage removes the worry for purchasing a memory card for keeping huge files. Battery is not providing the backup it should provide since it is 6000 MAh. Rest everything is fine from Camera Quality to User interface.

"
"

  Just bought two weeks Before. delivery very late. software small doubt it work worst .cam good. finger print sensor slow.i used mi honor and other mobile. Compare with these mobiles this software very bad.

"
"

  Its embarrassing that there was no back cover.  Silly things shouldn't be made by Samsung,  tou have a million of customers  who look up to your great company ,trusting your product,  don't let your client's turn away because of your silly mistakes.  Thank you. Samsung#

"
"

  It's network  connectivity  needs improvements  over 4g

"
"

  This is a good phone under 14k.The camera is Good.battery life is very good, you can get full day backup in one charge only. you don't have to stick with charger and carry it with you.For Multitasking and clicking picture awesome product from Samsung.But this phone lag in the area of  gaming.

"
"

  Likes; Amazing display, very good battery backup, impressive ram management with one ui 2.0, good weight management with 6000mah battery, good signal receptionDislikes; Poor built quality with plastic back( feel by touch), fingerprint reader is not quick, fingerprint magnet. Feels over sachuration in back camera..

"
"

  Awesome super amoled display.... Long lasting battery (2 days) ...camera not up-to the mark when compared with note9pro and realme6.. Didn't  supporting google cam

"
"

  M21 is an awesome product in all the terma...be it camera, battery life, internal memory and ram, performance, looks.Camera quality is excellent in good lighting. However it falls short while taking pictures in less light.I have been using xiamoi till now... not disappointed with new experiment.

"
"

  Excellant phone this is. After using M31 for few months I purchased this M21 for my brother and it's really worth spending. The huge battery compliments with fast charging. Not to mention the superb quality of camera and superfast fingerprint access. Best phone to purchase in this segment.

"
"

  Pros: everything excellent in this price range except* Battery life is not so long which a 6000 mah should**üëéüëéüëé charging speed is horrible.  Didn't charge fully in 4 hoursEither  do something  or I will have to return it

"
"

  Fingerprint reader - sometimes lagsOtherwise a very good phone.I had purchased this as a replacement on nokia 6.1 plus (stock android) phone. Though, this phone is not stock android but samsung has done a good job to keep the experience near same.Overall a good phone, keeping the price range in mind.

"
"

  1. This is the best phone at this price range2. Camera quality is good3. Battery backup is awesome it gives two days of backup4. Fingerprint sensor is remarkably fast5. The processor exynos is more energy efficient then Qualcomm Snapdragon 665

"
"

  Display glass is very delicate.....a pen fell on my screen and it cracked...I used moto for 4years but this never happenedI think Samsung has to work on display ..Rest everything is appreciable.....

"
"

  mashaallah over all good phone at this rate but earphones üéß missing ..when i called customer care they said for online purchase no earphones provide ...rest best buy product

"
"

  My primary reason for purchasing this phone us to engage in media watching for which this phone turns out to be a fantastic choice. The display and battery are great for my movie watching. The cameras are good. The overall user experience is highly satisfactory for this price.

"
"

  It seems like a fake Samsung phone, the features mentioned and the realistic experience didn't match at all, especially battery and in hand feel..upset with the Samsung

"
"

  One of the best medium range  Make  in India phone which is currently in the market.Battery life is upto mark.Camera quality is comparable with Redmi note 8 pro.Phone performance also OK for a medium range users.Over all one of the best choice in Medium Range Mobile below 15K INR

"
"

  Good budget phone. Specifications same as m30s. And price is low. Best to buy samsung mobiles comparing to other brands.

"
"

  I think Samsung needs to improve its battery over all it is a nice set of phone which the customers should be looking for.

"
"

  I purchase two month before (30:6:2020) after 2 Month its stop working the touch is broken while falling from height 2 feet no warranty for touch screen its cost around 6000 for replacement

"
"

  All over a brilliant phine for the given price..Provide quality performance. Camera is descent .. battery life is amazing.. super amoled screen.. those who don't want to buy the chinese phones.. must consider buying it.. I have been using it for over a month now. And I am quite satisfied with its performance.

"
"

  If you have budget of 13k go with it, you won't get anything better than this phone in this price range.Performance, battery backup, camera everything is best under this price tag. NO lag or heating issues whatsoever.

"
"

  This mobile quality is very nice . Lookwise is very auspicious, camera quality is No.1 image captured. Sound quality very smooth & not needed to headphones for songs . Delivery is ontime. Mobile body is very slim . You need to purchase mobile cover for that . Overall my experience was good.

"
"

  This phone is not worth buying. Within 3 days of buying it, there were some issues with its touch. Got it replaced but we faced the same problem again after some days of usage. This was unexpected from Samsung. Although I am a Samsung user but after such a bad experience of M21, I don't think I'll ever go for Samsung now.

"
"

  I parchased this product 20 days ago. Now it has a problem in charging. It has only showing changing indication but not charging at all,not even one present increase in battery backup. I am very disappointed.

"
"

  ¬†I personally think the best feature of this phone is battery life, like it literally last 2 days as for normal use,+ the fast change. Ordered this for my mother and she seems to like it.

"
"

  After 6 month1) Camera not working properly.2) phone become slow.3) sometimes applications crashes.4) Fingerprint not working sometimes.5) Battery backup is good.

"
"

  It is the perfect smartphone for me.Because of its massive battery and vibrant display. The camera is below average, I am a professional photographer , so I won't use phone camera often,  the massive battery helps me on my long working days. I the case of games the phone gives me a avg perfomance.

"
"

  Everything about the Samsung m21 is amazing, except the fact that you must purchase a mobile case for it. I got scratches on the plastic back within 6 hours after receiving it although I took the utmost care to prevent that from occurring. I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for this little nuissance.

"
"

  For battery and display i will give 10 out of 10 if u want to buy this phone you have to keep in mind that it is not a gaming phone but in this price you can't get display and long battery life like this. I'm using this phone since last four or five month here is no major issue at all over all 4.5 in 5.

"
"

  Battery back up is good. Camera quality is very gd fir me as I'm not a selfie person. I did doubt it but it's very gd non Chinese & standard brand we can get in India.

"
"

  Iam reviewing this after using 1 week..Cons:This phone takes lot of time to charge..like more than 3 hours to get fully charged..Pros:camera and batterylife is superb.features of this phone are excellent..quick fingerprint and face reading..If u want to take good videos and pictures this phone is the best.

"
"

  Battery claiming 6k MAH, But it's working like 2500 mah, drain very fast , night view camera quality not up to the mark, in comparison other compatative Brands, feature are very less, screen recording video feature provided by almost every brand, but it's not having

"
"

  The samsung m21 is unchallenging because of its premium features in low budget. I am really impressed by it's 48 MP camera and the battery, what to say man. It's awesome! Drawback is that it's charging speed is somehow less than expected but at its price point the phone is really good. At last it's an monstrous phone.

"
"

  I gifted this to my father. He did use Samsng earlier so wanted the same. He is very comfortable using it. The display is good, battery backup is good too and the camera a something that Samsung has improved for this series.

"
"

  It's a very good phone üòä it's camera quality is so good it's battery life is fantastic and iam very happy with fast charging feature . It's gaming experience verrrry nice .if you want a cool phone you should buy it

"
"

  A nice and  cost effective  handset with a good battery back up, nice camera, color  resolution  is perfect. The biggest  thing in this phone is IT IS MADE IN INDIA. And that is a perfect reason  you can purchase this phone and enjoy the android 10 version with Samsung. This is my 5th samsung gadget and I love it.

"
"

  The phone keypad is not working and the phone is so slow slow. Touch screen is not recognizing properly.  The phone is a gift to my parents in this quarantine. I have not heard back from the seller yet. WHY IS SAMSUNG PHONE defective? WHY is this the only seller approved by amazon. Not sure what are my next steps are.

"
"

  Super amoled display, fantastic user interface, very  good battery üîã and real 48 mp camera fulfill my all needs...I think  it is really  a  great deal  for me  to buy Samsung  galaxy üëå M 21

"
"

  Best Phone in the price range.OS is good. Colors are awesome. I charge only once a day. Better than other models in the price range.

"
"

  It's very bad charging time.  It's consume very very long time charging mobile.  It's really very slow charger and it's is very bad.  It's not complete fast charger....  My response is very bad in charging this mobile.

"
"

  I really  believe that this is my friend in my budget, because its looking  smart,when its come to BATTERY 6000mah this will helps me lot to work in this for long hours,then I talk about the CAMERA QUALITY 48+5+8MP the massive details will be captured by this,and finally its FINGERPRINT READER Is very fast and smoother.

"
"

  Display stopped working in three months and when we viaited service center they told told that LCD pressed and damaged. Asked for Rs. 5500 for screen replacement

"
"

  Bought on 29th July20. Blue Dot mark issue found on display at next day 7july20 of return closing date. Not able return the mobile.And some audio icon is coming automatically. Software  issue.Amazon is not taking  care of customer.Poor quality.  Poor customer  care.

"
"

  I think samsungs smartphones  are worlds best ever smartphones.Specially this M 21  6000mah  battery brings it to top among other brands smartphone in under Rs 15000 range.Also gaming,camera clarity,S Amoled display are best feature only give bay samsung at affordable  price .

"
"

  ¬†I like this mobile because of battery and other features are also fine. People who are intresred in this model, they can buy without any doubt.But one issue,  randomly a sound bar icon is popping up in the screen.  Please see the attached video.

"
"

  After using 1 month my opinion about this phone is great. Long battery life , well camera, no hanging and hitting issued.But is should be better if there ia a camera shutter sound off mode ,and daily data used in displayed.

"
"

  After 1month 25 days something later, i am writing this review. i think the Phone galaxy m21 is a Amazing  all rounder mobile. I caneasily play pubg, free fire with no lag and the most Amazing part is Battery- capacity. Its display is not Like a amoled Display bt too good better than Ips  display.

"
"

  Best branded phone in buget.More than worth in value.Amazing to see Oled display in Mobile,great experience to see video.Battary- supper strong.Camara have multiple option as per your need.Happy to have facility  to use dual social app like what's app.Fulfilled all my need in Budget.

"
"

  Have been using this phone for 3 months now. No complaints till date. One of the best phones in this price range.Great display & battery life.

"
"

  This phone has got all the features one is looking for, lookwise simple sober, nice picture quality, gud speed.The only issue i have is that i havent recieved  any bill with the package...

"
"

  Camera is good but aometimes hang and blirr images are coming. dosen't work in night mode, blinking video in slow motion. screen Touch is slow. Voice quality is ok sometimes higher and sometimes getblow automatically.Want to replace mobile how can i do that?

"
"

  Signal reception is so poor that inside the home I can't watch YouTube video with mobile data.User interface is good...I would love this phone if Samsung  could improve the signal reception.

"
"

  Awesome Mobile .Extra Ordinary Battery Life with decent amazing camera .Raven Black looks stunningüòçI Love Samsung M seriesI recommend every one to go for it...

"
"

  Not satisfied. phone very much heated when i was connect in charging.  And also its too long time taken for full charge.

"
"

  If you're looking for a mid-range phone and want as many as features u can get? Close your eyes and go for Samsung Galaxy M21.!I'm ordered for myself and after using it for 1 week only, i ordered the same piece for my grandfather too.The phone is amazing! Just go for it! üëçüëç

"
"

  This phone seems to be awesome under this price segment.I am using this phone for 7 day perfomance is too good and I don't have any complaints about performance no lag nothing till now and I have no word  to say about its display,really amazing.The quality of back camera can be increase.

"
"

  I m using m21 from last few days. First i would like to thank samsung and Amazon for this great phone at such a wonderful price. Camera, fingerprint, display quality is awesome. Very user-friendly. I baught two phones at a time for me n my wife. Both handsets performance is very good. I just love it.

"
"

  I like the monstrous battery,amazing display.no other brand can have the amazing display like this.The camera is good but not the best one.but for playing games like pubg,free fire it is performing well but occasionally it slow down for 4-5 seconds then it gets normal and performs well,Great speaker.

"
"

  FOR THIS RATE IS VERY GOOD DEAL(OTHER THAN CHINEES). MAIN AND SELFIE CAMERA'S QUALITY IS BETTER THAN OTHER CO MOBILES IN THIS SEGMENT.

"
"

  I am using it for last 8 days. Am very impressed with the camera clarity . I can say so as I am a Dslr user. Battery is also huge. So many features at a affordable price. Over all deserves 5 stars.

"
"

  They can make better. As samsung price are always higher then other smartphone. As samsung lover will buy samsung only.

"
"

  product is good and value for money but as usual Samsung selfie camera is not upto the mark they can improve it further.

"
"

  Pros 1.battery. Life2.display3.samsung brand4.Fingerprint sensor5.decent finger print scanner6Cons1.Old prosasar2.slitly slow3.recent price hike4.Cheap plastic body5.low light camera quality

"
"

  Nice mobile, (no screen guard, back cover and headset)  good battery backup ,suitable for games like pubg,  camera function was nice,  overall it's a nice product...made in India India product,  I love it.

"
"

  If a person's wants a smartphone with great specs and budget below 15k this smartphone is killer in its segment as battery lasts more than a day in single charge as well as the performance too awsome. I use this as my business smartphone and it had not disappointed me.Highly recommending this product.

"
"

  This Phone is really very very very good buy in this budget i.e. 14999/-. I am using Samsung since a long time and bought this as 11th phone from Samsung. it worth.Camera, Battery, Sound, Display, Touch - everything is more than good!Best buy budgeted phone!

"
"

  Satisfied. So far I have used I am happy. As a multimedia mobile it's performance is upto the mark. But as far camera is concern it does not justify the documented quality. It is almost equal to my 13 mp camera on another mobile of samsung brand. Overall it's good.

"
"

  Pros: bright displayCamera quality goodBattery life is good and last 3+ day if used only for callsCons:Camera switch on automatically every time you unlock or take the phone on hand.Battery life falls for 1day if used for gaming and others

"
"

  Excellent phone for daily/heavy use. Whooping 6000MAH battery is a dream come true in this range. See the image for camera quality. Overall really really nice experience, having this phone.  Bought it almost a month before, reviewing today cause I wanted it to see it's every aspect. Again, really nice experience.

"
"

  The Samsung Galaxy M20 is really a well-balanced and great choice. Gives real feel for the battery worth saying 6000 mAh. No need to charge frequently. Awesome performance... Recommend it!!!

"

  I have bought this product for my brother's birthday and he liked it very much. He has used the product for approx a week and he is very happy with it. Battery is awesome, he is able to use it for 2 continue days without charging. Size of the phone is ok and camera is also fine. Loved this product.

"
"

  Camera quality is best and fingerprint reader is also works good but I feel it should battery improvement overall it's good phone . Sound quality best . If you want samsung's budget phone under 14000 then buy it .

"
"

  Fully Satisfied with Product.Worth my money to spend on this gadget after 2 years.Purchased samsung phone with best specs in this price budget.  THANK YOU SAMSUNGüòä

"
"

  No cons whatsoever in regards to the smartphone, except for the camera. Although the picture quality is pretty great, the performance is a bit too slow, it takes several seconds to process the photo. It also happened in my older Samsung too. Maybe it is fixable by updates in the future.

"
"

  Today i unsealed this pack & switch on the phone. Then reboot system start . I can't understand why its occurred.  May be some technical issues.  Please guys must check & use.

"
"

  Pros:good Battery life as of now 6000MAH is worthy.I am using mobile  with data for around hours minimum  still while going to bed can see around 40-50% remaining.Camera: it is ok , I can't say it is super.Microshots are not clear.Finger print, face unlock  both are rapid.

"
"

  This is one of the best value for money phones under ‚Çπ15,000.Pros:- Amazing camera- Great battery life- Value for money- Good featuresCons:- Samsung Keyboard crashes at times- Fingerprint Reader can be better (It should be more responsive)

"
"

  Its dont have hiding photos ,dual app facility ,and dont haves camera zoom capacity and hanging while messaging in WhatsApp suddenly ....battery is very good and voice quality while talking is good compared to others,front camera good  and class look mobile ,sound quality is very very good ,fingerprint good etc..

  Galaxy M21 is an amazing cellphone more odd a portable gadget that would replace a laptop on to go.Flowing through various options is really smooth,  camera captures lifelike images, fabulous display,  convincing battery to keep the phone on the go without a need for a recharge during the day.

"
"

  This is the finest phone in this price range. With such a huge battery life it is just unbeatable. A super amoled display gives it n immersive viewing experience. Everything in this phone works more than amazing. Just go for it and not to mention the UI is also the best among any other smartphone.

"
"

  call is not clear manufacturing issues for many users, also don't buy oneplus nord the camera is very bad.

"
"

  I love this product. First of all I'm looking for another brand for mobile then I saw the Samsung M21 with 48mp camera with the effective prize, then I was shocked. And as soon as possible I booked this wonderful mobile and click my first pic with this. I thanks Samsung for launching this amazing phone.ü•∞üòçüòçüòçüòç

"
"

  Touch screen not working . Left side not working. Phone can't restart not open nor close. Service center not replacing the phone. Online purchase can't replaced. 1 at time purchase but very bad experience

"
"

  The worst mobile I have bought. It was for my mother, and Phone is completely off and not charging anymore within a month. It‚Äôs very difficult for her to go to service Center at this pandemic stage. Either Samsung is manufacturing defective product or Amazon is cheating us by selling defective mobile.

"
"

  It's a superb phone. Loads of features. Amazon has the lowest cost when it comes to any market online and offline. You get dark mode, and better features than redmi or any brands.

"
"

  The device is truly a monster at this price. Battery will work for 2 days without charging on normal usage. Back camera awesome. Front camera could have been better but is still very good. The smartphone is fluid on touch...All praises for this buy..The M21/M31 series can bring samsung back in the game

"
"

  I have received the phone on 4 June 2020 and the phone is heating a lot on even the first day. I don't like the product.i want to replace this product but Amazon isn't replacing , amazon se aisa expect nhi kiya tha

"
"

  otg not connecting

"
"

  Awesome smartphone.Battery backup is very good.Camera quality is nice .Security is also very goodFingerprint sensor are working properly.I have been using this phone from 3months.Very good experience with this phone

"
"

  Look and feel is premium and the display just lovely.Camera is good too at this price range.. I used redmi note 7 which is of same price at that point if time i bought the phone but the samsung sAmoled dislay takes the lead for m21

"
"

  I'm giving this five stars for this mobile phone.What? You see only one?Oh, that might be like the camera of this cell phone by Samsung.48 MP? - Then why should I waste my money of S20 ultra? Wow, Samsung.

"
"

  Worst cell I have ever brought charging is very slow for 1 hour charge only 10% increasing it means from 0 to 100 it takes 8 to 10 hours worst cell . There is no refund for this cell I just don't recammonde this cell

"
"

  The camera is good. The battery service is very good

"
"

  Cons :- Device heats up very soon, can't run heavy apps, charging time took upto 3 hours, hang or lag sometimes, fingerprint sensor don't work sometimes, you can't play pubg at all not even on smooth/low settings, touch latency is very low, unable to get fast touch response.Pros :- super amoled display.

"
"

  Phone is one of the best phone under 15k..I have purchased it 2 months ago.no lags ,having a powerful monstrous battery can run up to 6 days by changing settings, one of the best thing is its camera quality which is superb with it's super amoled display .thanks samsung for providing such a budget phone.

"
"

  Its been a decent  performance  till now, its been 2 weeks, since I bought m21, finger print scanner, battery life, camera all good, apps are launching in quick time.Demerit: I feel the  phone  is getting  heated for 1.5 hrs of continuous  use.  But the user experience may differ

"
"

  Best phone in this budget because all important feature are available in this samsung M21 great battery backup and it's has also super slow motion and really it's best phone in mid range under 14k

"
"

  If your budget is under ‚Çπ15000, then go for it. Camera is good, display is superb, battery is awesome and multiple apps run smooth if you're using them at the same time.The display is really awesome but the screen is weak. So if you're buying it, please put on a screen guard and a back cover.

"
"

  Everything is good ,but the camera angle on normal is slightly less and the selfie camera's wide angle is no that wide to get satisfactory result .Battery is great and display is superb overall a great phone to buy .Consider it  buying if you want constant and steady performance for long run.Thanku

"
"

  It was a defective piece I believe, stopped working after 15 days and reported to Samsung service centre , the response from the centre was bad though the head office had given a voucher for replacement immediately the middle man (Service centre in T.nagar chennai ) had the worst possible response.

"
"

  The mobile samsung galaxy m21 is value for money ü§ëü§ë , the batteryüîã backup is amazing ü§©ü§©and the cameraüì∑üì∑ quality is nice üëçüëç, but the face unlock quality should be improved and the capability of charging  should be increase from 15 watt..... It means adapter should be improved...............

"
"

  I had this device  for over a month and it's pretty smooth in your day to day task. UI is clean and fingerprint sensor is bit slow but manageable. Battery is really huge. Won't have any problem with battery it last long, charges fast. Best phone if your looking for non Chinese  manufacturer and in Budget Segment.

"
"

  It is a good phone for those who have normal usage. However the camera quality could have been improved, but I like the battery life. It goes for the whole day without charging. A good phone for students.

"
"

  Received mobile before time and in good condition. Working nice, very good features. Need to explore more but camera is amazing!

"
"

  The device is a real monster when talking of battery backup. It really is amazing and last much longer compared to others. The sensors, camera, screen everything proves to be just perfect and completely meets a person's expectations.I have personally shared it in my friend and family circle and encouraged people to buy it .

"
"

  SAMSUNG GALAXY M21 IS GREAT SMARTPHONE IN UNDER INR.14000.GREAT CAMERA = 48MPGREAT DISPLAY  = SUPER AMOLEDGREAT BATTERY = 6000MAH WITH 15W FAST CHARGER.GREAT BUILD QUALITY = FRONT GORILLA  GLASS 3 AND BACK POLYCARBONATE.GREAT PERFORMANCE WITH EXYNOS 9611THANK YOU SO MUCH SAMSUNG.

"
"

  I am using M21 it's very good camera quality and very fast fingerprint radar and battry life its average very fast drain and small network issues value for money phone only 13800/- in sale

"
"

  Watta beast in this range , go for it for media consumption.Gaming can be done the best processor can just give 10 to 5 more fps than this chipset. The display is mind-blowing many times better than ips LCDs. Samoled in this price is a bonus.Camera is decent .Battery is humongous.Very smooth for daily usage.

"
"

  The best of all smartphones within this range, a must buy smartphone for those who r looking for massive battery ,very good camera quality,ultra nice displayüòç.great processor ,but night mode is not that good

"
"

  Faulty Charging socket in just a week...now round about to service center to fix this..wrost experience..don't buy..it takes more then two hours to get fully charged...and top of that service center try to fix this problem just by pluged second hand old socket.. which not worked more then a week

"
"

  Battery life is great.I have to full charge my phone once and it lasts nearly a day and half. Wonderful camera and speaker quality.Fingerprint reader is quite sensitive. Overall I would say this phone is worth its price.

"
"

  Battery life is not good. I think 6000mAH is only in written . It not works like 6000mAH.Please improve.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is so fast as usual to compare to other brand mobileBattery life is too long as usual they say ""monster mobile""Camera quality is good üëçAnd if you are student when definitely buy it.

"
"

  1.This Phone is not suitable for gaming2.Battery Charge will get down faster when phone getting hot3.Did not expect from samsung mobile company to manufacturing this product4.The above review was given from by using the samsung m21 for 3months

"
"

  display is very bad . .  it's not even1 month after buying but now the display is not working properly .... don't go for it ....i want a refund for this item

"
"

  Ok phoneAwesome batteryAverage cameraAvG processorAvg performanceNot suitable for gaming

"
"

  If you want everything good in a budget, go for it!Its a but thick but these days all phones are coming in thick design due to big camera and battery. But both camera and battery are awesome in this phone.

"
"

  I bought this mobile yesterday... I had Charged more than 6 hours But It got 40% only... Mainly I ordered it for display and battery.. Display is Good.. But, Battery life is very very poor.... I totally disappointed... I trying to report and replace this mble... But there is no correct response...

"
"

  Light weight, superb camera, medium fast processor,both face and figherprint sensor is very fast,very battery performance,back glass cover is given which is really nice to see.Orvall mobile performance is good.It has some best new technologies like AR or bixby vision

"
"

  This phone is exactly what I wanted, good camera quality, long-lasting battery life and a perfect gaming experience. If you need a budget phone with fast processing quality and big storage, take it. But it would have been even better if it had a Snapdragon proceesor. Still, I love it.

"
"

  Phone worked fine for the first 3 days then the sound stopped working and the after sometime it started working, then when the sound issue was resolved the touch screen stopped working and now it's not working at all. Pathetic service by amazon sending faulty piece and also reducing their return period time.

"
"

  Phone is ok ok in this price range. 48 mp Camera and fingerprint  sensor is not so good, also will take 4-5 hr in full battery charge but overall is nice. Display and battery life is perfect. Good nonchinese option.

"
"

  Until now, I didn't observe any downside or negative part in this mobile set of its price level...Fingerprint reader is very smooth..Battery life fabulous..Camera quality is excellent..Good one...

"
"

  For 6000Mah battery and display quality.. this is the best affordable mobile you can get.Super slow motion is awesome and so the other camera options.Better than many phones with better config.Here u see a Satisfied and happy customer writing review.

"
"

  Display automatically gone black after one month and samsung service centre says this does not cover in warranty. No liquid damage, no outside damage, still does not cover in warranty. Then what does the warranty means for Samsung. Bad product, I purchase it because I do not want to purchase a Chinese phone.

"
"

  What a battery 6000 mah it's a real monster of battery backup and I love it Samsung super amoled display ,camera  quality is very nice,fingerprint works very good ,processor is decent But charger 15volts  Samsung fans wants more volts charger minimum 25 volts because charging for 6000 mah battery.

"
"

  Very poor quality touch.Its simply not a user free android mobile.I am facing problem to use mobile At the time charging. It goes totally useless, totally touch is off, no other function is done.

"
"

  Battery drains more . Almost 10% consumes in night without use. As i had use 3 samsung phones few years back so not a scare thing for me. In this case might be because of sAmoled screen. Expect in more colour variants.

"
"

  Camera 5 star out of 5.Battery 5 star out of 5.Performance 5 star out of 5.The best phone i have ever purchased.

"
"

  After use of almost 1 month i am very disappointed with this smartphone.Battery took too much time for charge it took nearly 2.5 to 3 hours.Camera is above average.Phones lags frequently after 1 month of use.I don't recommend this to any one.No doubt battery back up is very good.

"
"

  Best value for money product.. If u want to give some good for normal usage...u can buy it blindly.. At this price 6000 amp battery nd sooper amlode display.. Great balancing in weight distribution.. overall build quality (though plastic back).. And last but not least Brand SAMSUNG....

"
"

  The phone is supb at this range i like it very much . One of the best phone camera is also very good and specially at night  But samsung had not given back cover this is one dislike and another that samsung had no given app lock system which is another dislike in this phone.Thank you.

"
"

  The phone is a complete package. Writing this review after using for 14 days, this phone matches all specifications and claims made by Samsung. Really nice phone. Must go for it.

"
"

  This Samsung is amazing. The fingerprint sensor and the the fast User Interface adds to its many qualities. It's easy to use and the hardware is reliable. Very less heating issues.

"
"

  I have bad experience with samsung galaxy M 21 .. In two months I lost speaker and pin for charging... I went to samsung service center and asked about the same and they replied that the warranty is for the same purposes.,.. I felt they are very neglect with customers,.

"
"

  Everything is good, and the brand says everything , if price is little bit low then it would be a great phone

"
"

  The best thing I like is display of  smartphone.Its processor is above average . I like it.This product is suggested for you if you're buying midrange smartphone .Samsung should give more features through updates in ONE UI 2.0 as in Samsung A series smartphone.However The Smartphone is best.

"
"

  Heating issue - while using mobile data and hotspot the phone is getting more heat. 6000 mAh battery is working as a 3000 mAh battery.The hope that Samsung had on top is gone.If this is not the only problem then this is a good phone.

"
"

  Very nice phone .. just charging is slow 15w only it take 2 to 2.30 hours to full charging...Product is of 15,999 but delivery boys get 16000  from customers and that delivery boy also do this for other products 2 time with me .. and I knew he also do this with other customers

"
"

  Best budget phone... Made in India , satisfy with Samsung M21...Easy Multitasking,  huge battery, nice display..Good signal reception , hearing aid..

"
"

  ¬†Really amazed by the phone perfirmance. Been using this a week now. The perfomance is great and the battery is more than sufficient for someone like me. Easily lasts the entire day for me.Front camera is good, rear cam is just too good while using PRO features

"
"

  Super phone super battery life two dayPhone no legBut charging time about 2.5 hoursPhone camera quality is best in outdoorIndoor quality no bestAll over phone is bestPurchased to my all friend‚Äôs

"
"

  The phone is aweaome except one thing. It is so slippery and dust magnet so it needs extra care or pouch.Battery backup 1.5 days at extreme usage (excluding gaming).Best for entertainement.Even it has 6000 mah it feels very light.

"
"

  The battery is indeed a monster! Lasts really long subject to usage. The camera quality is great.  Low light photography has also quite decent. Display is quite good as well.  Overall I am quite happy with this purchase at this price point.

"
"

  Good battery, good camera quality, sound could be improved. But that's the best at its price. It's been 2 months since I purchased this. I am really happy with my choice.

"
"

  The Samsung m21 has a much more networks issue than other mobile set.My friend have another mobile m20 that has also a same issue and could not work ssmoothly.We are very unhappy with this product brand Samsung. So please test networks thoroughly before launching.

"
"

  Mobile gets heated and camera and battery are not good. Return policy is the worst case to experience with amazon

"
"

  After using 2 week I gave this review first of all thanks Amazon for such an amazing phone at this price. Camera (front &back) - 5/5 , display -5/5, touch is good , overall performance of this phone is nice. If someone has any questions regarding this phone so without any doubt buy this product.

"
"

  Here I am writting the review after using the phone for 1 week. The best thing i like in the phone is its batterry life. The charging speed is good. I used the phone for 1 hr talk with only 3% of battery consuption. Really monster battery. The camera quality is good. Over all I like the handset.

"
"

  The edge of the screen was somehow damaged while the back of the phone contained  some scratches  out of the box. Tried replacing it but there were no such provisions. Performance, battery life and camera  worked precisely but disappointed by the seller and return policy  of Amazon.

"
"

  Really loving this phone at this price range, battery lasts upto 2 days with moderate usage., dusplay quality is superb and processing is totally lag free. Thanks Samsung for making such good products.

"
"

  I love the battery life much....It's too good.Fingerprint is modarate, acceptable.Camera is lovely, fenomenal...it' s reslly good.Processor is good.  And most importently rsm function is extraordinary....love it.Overall the phone is lovely and pocket friendly. M21.üëå

"
"

  Manufacturing defect. First handset was changed and second one too had the same issue like when video is played, the audio is very feeble and inaudible. I had to restart the phone on couple of occasions. The technical team of Amazon was contacted and they found out and later initiated for the refund.

  I bought this phone after so much of research which will best fit my needs on budget.  After 45 days of use i don't have any major issues regarding this mobile it works perfectly and the battery life is awesome. you can buy it without thinking of anything else because in this budget it's on the top .üôÇüôÇüôÇ

"
"

  Very nice phone. Very satisfying product at this cost. Loved it. The battery is really high. I can play games all day without even charging the phone. The phone does not heat much. It most of time stays cool.üòâ

"
"

  Reviewing after 1 month use.Camera, fingerprint sensor, battery, display are awesome... processor can be better but good. Heating effect very minimum for mid range games because I didn't try any high range games. Light weight phone although having a massive battery.Very good product..

"
"

  I am a Realy Samsung lover. Continue useing Samsung brand.1.NYC Stylish look.2 battery performance very good.Everything Very good M21. Value for money.Thanks Samsung/Amazon

"
"

  M21 is an excellent phone from Samsung - great battery backup, very good camera, nice looks, affordable price. Overall, a great offering at a very attractive price...

"
"

  I am a teacher and take online classes for a minimum of eight hours a day. I find this phone very helpful as even after multiple hours of usage, there is no need to charge it again and again. I charge it once a day and the battery lasts for a minimum of 24 hours. So overall I am satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Excellent performance of the phone.  Two days battery backup along with smooth operation. Here I recommend to buy this and the price is also much lower compared to other company mobile in same features. Thanks a lot Sumsung India be proud to buy make in India.

"
"

  A very good phone good battery backup once you charge then use it for 15-17 hours non stop! From camera is not too good but rear camera is good overall a good phone no hang problem I have face in 10 day of use and can play pubg 2-3 hour easily charging is also good take around 2 hrs 30 min to full charge!!!

"
"

  Used for one month..Smooth performance..Good battery..Only problem is, the phone become little hang while opening camera application..(that's why 4star)Gaming also good..Overall best budget phoneI wish.. Samsung should include back cover and earphone with midrange phones üòÅ

"
"

  Once again sanding has done wonders. I‚Äôm avid  Apple user and thought to give a chance over for m21 and WALLAH it‚Äôs wonderful, amazing battery, camera, finger print is fast, which reception is great, definitely plastic could be better but it is great at the price range.

"
"

  I like the SuperAMOLED Display Excellent Battery Life Nice Build Quality No Hitting Issue Back Camera Was Nice Front Camera Was Ok Samsung Makes best Phones Ever

"
"

  The phone is perfect at one's budget. It has many useful features and has a long and wide display. Samsung should provide updates to reduce data size of images taken as they occupy a quite large size and should correct the error that creates a duplicate contact when we edit an existing contact.

"
"

  Worst phone ,worst processor, worst camera, worst battery life and always network was low,,NEVER EVER BUY THIS PHONE  ,I LOSS ALL MONEY ON THIS WASTE PHONE,,SO I WILL COMPLAIN AGAISNT THESE ON COURT,,IN 10 days return policy , it worked well after 10 days it is lagging, worst phone,,VIVO U20 WAS BEST THAN THIS

"
"

  Writing this review after 28 days, this is the best budget phone, it has a massive battery, fingerprint reader is super fast, camera is very very very good and it's live focus mode is outstanding. Although I'm not a gamer but I spent almost 2-3 hours playing PUBG without any problem. This is a real monster‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

"
"

  Fingerprint and face unlock is much fasterIn hand feel is good and slim designCamera is ok at this price rangeProcessor is ok for normal daily useBattery is real monster and literally i use it about 12hr and consume only 65%Overall it is a great phone in this price range as well as Samsung brand

"
"

  Battery excellent. Display Super. That's all. Camera very poor. Pic with 13 MP camera is better. Unnecessary apps consumed most of the memory. If you want to buy Samsung mobile only.. then go for M20 Far better in price..with not much differences.

"
"

  ¬†i got this phone for my mom as a gift and she loved it. the camera is superb. the battery life is amazing good. There amazing features you can explore. It‚Äôs a phone worth it‚Äôs cost. Big shout out to amazon for spot on delivery ensuring the product is not tampered.

"
"

  This is the worst phone I've ever bought. I bought this phone because of the samsung brand, but since day one this phone keeps creating one or another problem. Finger print sensor is too slow and most of the time fails to recognize the fingerprint.  Touch is also not good and sometimes becomes unresponsive.

"
"

  I purchased this phone only for because of 6000 battery and it's good. Other feature are more and some with other phones. Also face lock functions is that good with other phones. And sometimes there is problem with finger sensor. Overall this phone is good.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor given 4*,Bettery Life given 4.3*,Camera quality 4.3*,Face unlock disappointed üò• me, given only 3*,Big problem in this Phone is network issue, network incoming not good this phone, But overall performance is better then others indian Brands like Karbon, lava. Thank you for the reading my review

"
"

  Review after 10 days of usage.Battery life : superb, 3-4 days of battery life with game being played.Looks : AwesomeSpeed: good as it is powered by 4 gb ramIf you want to play games on it then I would prefer you to buy the 6/128 variant instead.Overall best at this price range.

"
"

  I like this product and I am using it since 1 month and it is really good .But they are giving  software updates  very late.And after all it is a nice product .

"
"

  The phone is pretty awesome.The battery is really amazing it stands for atleast 18 hrs. UI is very smooth and fast. Never faced any issues..Not great for gamingCamera is also very good but the low light comditions arent that great.

"
"

  Great smartphone at this budget, love the performance of the smartphone also love the battery performance, camera preference also great overall a good smartphone to buy.

"
"

  The processor, the screen light, the battery, the sound, everything is more than i expect, its worth to buy it. Thanks to samsung for your wonderful and amazing work.

"
"

  ¬†Camera qulity is very good , some heating issues i hope it will be solved in future updates, mobile stability for long use , battery life gives me about 1 whole day without gaming n about 16 to 17 hours on 2/3 hours of gaming, mobile doest hang works smoothly ,

"
"

Please go ahead and send me the new phone as its under warranty. You can contact us on 9654887313 or on 96543 80292.

  Want to give zero Star As Didnt Get Quality Product Just Get Corrucpted Touch Pad in One Month, Servicenter Denied to Take Care This Query They Charge 5500 for New Phone. Battery drains Little bit Faster. Even Full charge of Phone i can spend only 1 full day use only.. also it takes 2.5 hours to full charge.

"
"

  I  have been using this phone for two months . And it is pretty  decent . No legs and getting up issueBattery is good, but not the best. If your mobile data it will last for 16 to 20 hours long .Camera qty ok , not good for indoor shooting.Overall nice phone in this price range.

"
"

  After 7 days use I didn't  find any issue in this device, overall it's  working fine and good camera quality .......without any doubt  can purchase  this ..only one issue is about charging  ,it takes  3 hrs for 100% battery but u can  use this to two days with full use

"
"

  disappointed ....Most painful about this M21 is getting very hot....I don't use to play game or using any heavy software..just interest surfing and it get hot within 10 to 15 min...and the condition is such that I cannot put the mobile to my ears because of it hotness..üòûüòûüòû

"
"

  Samsung again disappointed. Touchscreen is not smoothly picking up your fingers touch. Fingerprint reader is also not a fast reader. Camera is good. Looks of mobile is also good. Within a month after purchasing this mobile started hanging.  Overall the must not be purchased in some around 17K.

"
"

  The phone is really a watta monster. I have been not been reviewed any thing before but this device battery is not draining upto two days on hard usage .The camera is awesome specially it's AR EMOJI . Display is just like oneplus fluid display. Processor is better that note 9 pro . Overall the phone is Great

"
"

  Fantastic buy ... Love it ... Value for money ... And specially want to mention ... ITS MADE IN INDIA .

"
"

  Writing about this phone after used redmi k20 pro.Display is good note clear as k20 pro, touch response is good.Camera is good only image lookwise not in detailingBattery backup is niceNot found any network issueUI is awesome and easy to use.

"
"

  I bought this phone @13999 rs and I found it's best quality within this price range. Overall Functioning is great. Battery  lasts more than a day with full uses (whatsapp..Fb...Calls..All day hotspot on), camera is 48 mp...With many functions viz SM, SSM etc. I would rate 5 star .

"
"

  I like everything about it. It's only been three days since it was delivered and I set it up and began using it. Call clarity is good. Touch operation is extremely responsive. Overall aesthetic of the phone is pleasant. No problems so far. I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  The fingerprint reader is very secure as it ask you to apply pattern every 72 hours. The super amoled display takes it to the next level experience of HD videos.Camera quality is very awesome and you can never ever complain regarding the battery life.Great experience and a must buy smartphone at this range.

"
"

  I like the phone but what I don‚Äôt like the thing the Samsung doesn‚Äôt provide the earphone with the phone. It hardly makes a difference that one earphone must be with phone. I know it‚Äôs a marketing strategy where company want to sell the products.

"
"

  Upgraded from my old A7 phone to this - very reliable phone just because of the amazing battery life. All other specs are good too for this price.

"
"

  Mobile camera or screen is good, but Amazon Mujes has a problem that you bill bill paper is always incubated with every product, there is no receipt, this wrapper is a bit too small.3.5/5

"
"

  I like this phone very much.  because  I the galaxy series this M21 is the best phone and its look like very simple..I like the design of this phone..the camera is also very good... so this is an awesome product..

"
"

  Good display quality, wonderful battery life. Excellent quality product from Samsung. Thank you amazon

"
"

  Very much disappointed as the screen was broken by just falling from bed (about 3 feet). Company is saying that it is scratch proof.

"
"

  Microphone is so bad that you can't  video call some one and talk to them without earphone and the same problem  with voice call while speaker is on that small problem  can really creates major issues some time beside that mobile is so fine for daily use gud product to replace Chinese  brands.

  Good product, Battery life is good, camera quality is satisfied, display is very good, if company provides fast charging is more better for this heavy battery charging, iam giving 5 stars for the price point

"
"

  The phone is fantastic. Long battery life and excellent camera. I have saved too many e-books in the internal memory of the phone. Still, it works very smoothly. Love this purchase and satisfied.

  The product is very good as it works smoothly and the battery stays the whole day.. I loved it..

"
"

  Sometimes battery drain quickly like 1% for 3 minutes without any usage. I think they have some bug in the software. Since my return window is closed have to reach service center during this pandemic. Not a wise option  to choose this mobile lot of alternative available.

"
"

  One of the best best budget phone...Overall nice features..

"
"

  I have use this phone about 2 months.....DisplaY-10/10Fingerprints and face lock -10/10Battery is great but not like it is 6000mah baterrylooks like 5000mah battery.During gaming sometimes it lag and always heats after 2hrs of gaming as heated rod...All over good

"
"

  With 6000MAH battery u don't have to worry about frequent charging... Camera quality is superb. .u will not get such a wonderful deal in this low price...Thanks Samsung

"
"

  The fingerprint sensor, battery life and camera quality are at par with my expectations, if not better. It's worth recommending the product to other buyers.

"
"

  After so long i buyed a samsung device but again samsung disappointed me,When i open the app it opens with lots of lag.

"
"

  Galaxy m21 has  awesome super Amoled display is fantastic and it has huge battery 6000mah is perfect for solid one day heavy usage like gaming, etc. It worth for money. It is one of the best mobile under this budget. It's performance is also awesome. I reviewed this after one month of usage.

"
"

  Superb delivery. Amazing display. Clean UI. Not Chinese. Excellent battery life. Okayish camera, could've been better. Overall an amazing phone

"
"

  I don't understand how my favorite samsung company's mobile failed..I gifted this mobile and got review in 6Hrs that touch is not working any how...And also it cant be restarted due to touchscreen not working..Deeply disappointed.... with my most believable brand-company...

"
"

  Battery life is but not a 6000 Mah.Camera is not a good quality for Samsung Galaxy m21 , first click photo not use fingerprint, second then click not off click sound is very bad time to click photo, and click photo 48 mg pixel camera quality very bad and not zoom to 48. Mg pixel click photo so thanks

"
"

  The battery malfunctioned exactly after a month. It stopped charging. And due to the lockdown, cannot even visit a Service Center. So basically I'm stuck with a brick.

"
"

  In love with the user interface. Its runs auper smooth and did not bug for even a second as of now. I bought it about a couple of week ago. The display is crystal clear, camera cam be a little upgraded but at this proce I would say Samsung M21 proved to be an excellent budget phone for me üòÅ

"
"

  After one ui2.1 updatebattery back up is better also having option of deep sleeping apps, free fire running smooth on ultra graphics, back side getting scratches easily eventhough using covers

"
"

  Awesome deal. Better than rest of the Chinese junk. Thank you Amazon

"
"

  Its 1st day and phone started heating  up alot while charging,  while talking  over the phone and while  setting  up. Seems some issue with audio automatically  opposite  person voice comes out of speakers  without even the speaker button isn't  on

"
"

  Camera is  very poor 20mp is just like 5mpAnd 48mp is like 13mp picture quality is very dull battery is good. There is no GMS that is very important for all mobile users. No security features for app like gallery, hike, phone pay etc. But display is awesome .

"
"

  totally awesome package worth purchase .the cheapest 48 MP camera smartphone to buy in or after lockdown. lightweight good in hand feel + samoled TOTALLY A DEAL!!

"
"

  Battery backup is excellent, but camera is not up to the mark. I was using Galaxy note5 before this mobile, that camera was only 16MP rear and 5MP front but the picture quality is far more better than M21 48MP rear and 20MB front camera. Disappointed. Not at all happy with the picture quality.

"
"

  This phones  range between 5000 to7000. But phone  is 14000.am bispoint batteries  life . 8 hours  battery dren. Please  you not buy this phone.  Phone is so slow

"
"

  Battery life is good.Camera seems to be fineNot hanging while playing high graphics games.Only problem I see is heating issue.

"
"

  Samsung galaxy M21 is really amazing product with affordable price, the quality of 48mp camera is relly too good and the live focuse mode is very clear and sharp which is very much attractive. The 6000mah bettry capacity  is really appreciable. I will definitely recomand this mobile phon with very much affordable price.

"
"

  Value for money.... what else we need from a smart phone ..... it has a long battery life and fast charging as well....multi functioning is good due to increased RAM and samsung exynios processor that also at budget price. Never regretted purchasing this.

"
"

  phone delivered with manufacturing defects. Amazon asked to send so many images to find the defects. After wasting one whole day and so many conversations with customer care, they agreed to replace the phone. What horrible day it was. Got cracked display second time as well. Going for refund.

"
"

  Camera quality is good not best but decentImpr sauce part is the battery life and the most interesting feature is th SUPER AMOLEDA DISPLAY it's just awesome and colours just brilliantOverall k very recommended device at this price toh non gamers and content consumers

"
"

  Good performance according to Samsung Exynos 9611,Battery life is awesome,Camera could be better in low light or night lightSpeakers are also very clearDisplay always awesome as it is Samsung Super Amoled4 star just because of Camera Quality at Low light levels

"
"

  In this price this is the best device with 1080P super amoled display , display is so nice., The only minor problem is battery will take 2:30 hours to fully charge , and you may not put finger properly on fingerprint reader cuz it have no depth but if you back cover you can easily use it ,speaker quality is quite good ,

"
"

  phone heat what should i do now

"
"

  Quality phone and reasonable price from Samsung. Camera quality is good. Battery life is excellent.

"
"

  Bad quality phone .i got my phone on 23rd july after an week the phone started lagging even today I kept my phone on charging after charging the phone display was totally dead .. I don‚Äôt need this phone anymore I want my refund pls contact me on rudraplast@gmail.com

"
"

  If you wish to buy this mobile go ahead for it because of the following reasons.1.Its battery is huge as mentioned.2.Its camera quality is also nice.3.Its face lock fingerprint reader is also pretty quick.Overall the phone is justü§©ü§©ü§©And i am satisfied  with this mobile üòÑ

"
"

  The phone comes with fully charged OS that is android 10 and display ,touch its awesome. Worth the money comparing with other brand phone. I recommend to all. Ill buy this again if i have to get another phone.Samsung is the brand to go for in terms of Battery after sale service and reliability

"
"

  Best u can get at this price range. Amoled display, fast processor, large screen, faster operation, good aesthetic. Fingerprint reader is good enough, doesn't fail. Huge battery to accompany you whole day.

"

  The phone sim card/memory card slot was defective and wouldn't accept the memory card. Had to go to service centre to get it repaired

"
"

  Facing heating issue within 24 hr of use.I received this product on 20th July. While charging facing over heating issue. Top side of  front and back both ( camera side) getting hot.

"
"

  I used this product for 1 month and now is screen is impaired. I cant use it now . It had a bit camera problems too but now the whole touch screen is not working.What should i do now?

"
"

  When i using the mobile, I thought that it is an old mobile. The mobile was too slow and the sound quality of the phone is very bad. Within 1 week the phone gets struck many times. WASTE OF BUYING.

"
"

  I ordered it instead of mi note 8 because price was same but when I checked camera and weight slimness and brand value not Chinese it is much better than mi note 8 ....

"
"

  Best phone from best company, with massive 6000mah battery it lasted for 2.5 days with single charge, best display, good camera. Actually bought it for my father he is very happy with purchaseJust superb üî•üî•

"
"

  After a long time I bought Samsung phone but quite disappointed with it.the touch has stopped working within few days. its not even been a month when I purchased my phone.Going for Samsung was a bad idea.i usually buy realme or oppo phones and they work pretty well

"
"

  Great SmartphoneCould be one of the best in the series.The camera is great as well as the finger print scanner. The best thing in the Smartphone is the screen. It's beautiful and big.I would advise everyone to take this Smartphone.

"
"

  I Love The SAmoled Display And The 6000mah Battery... Awesome Battery Life..I Switched From Ips Display From SAmoled Display The SAmoled Display...The Contrast Level Of This Display Awesome...#WattaMonster

"
"

  The mobile from samsung never disappointed me.If you say about camera it's  3.5 out of 5Display as usual very good 4.5 out of 5Battery life is very much good...... 5 out of 5faced one small may be major issue is low signal bandwidth. felt bit less netwok in the phone

"
"

  Very very excellent mobile. Design good,. Camera nice,. Display satisfaction, battery  back up to the mark

"
"

  I just this Monster!!!Best camera ever seen below 15000 rangeAnd I personally  prefer Samsung  phones because  they don't  have any ADS, like xiomi,mi,realm,vivo and oppo.best in camera, Monster 6000mah battery , super  amoled  display  and powerful  processor and last but  not the least amazing one UI...

"
"

  Great value of money smartphone, i didn't find any defects or any other problems in my phone. I am reviewing this after 10 days, after checking this device deeply, the battery of this device is insane,  in heavy usage this phone can go upto 1.5 days, Great product.

"
"

  Brilliant Camera, Huge Battery Life and Brilliant Display and Great Sound Quality packed with Dolby Atmos which gives you brilliant sound quality in earphones and in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG.Highly Recommended phone.I am enjoying it.

"
"

  I booked this mobile M21 mobile for my father. He is used to it and enjoying new stunning camera and other apps. Only problem he faces to unlock using fingerprint.

"
"

  Wow amazing phone i got it for 12699 but unfortunately it is increased now to 13999. But overall it is good even in that price also.I will recommend this phone to all. #Boycott üá®üá≥

  All features are good except  battery life which is almost as equal as a 4000 to 5000 mah battery.  Rest of  the features are good.

  Normal calling and message app itself hanging, very very poor performance.To Call starting and ending, its taking more than 3seconds.Its irritating me lot.If you are switching aeroplane mode on/off, hardly it will take 3seconds of time.Fingerprint very slow and not detecting sometime.

  Mobile phone delivered today . So far the performance is very satisfactory. Thanks to Samsung. It is manufactured in India.

"
"

  Phone looks good but signal is to weak n more over have issues with hotspot my laptop won't connect to the mobile hotspot. N there is no solution from Samsung. This worries me.

"
"

  Please don't buy this phone...speaker does not work at all..and  Amazon  return or replace  policy does not work...you will spend hours wasting trying to talk to AmazonPlease don't buy

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is super sensitive, camera takes crisp shots even in low light, selfies are excellent, battery is good under normal use. Overall a very good offering at this price point. And it's far more reliable than the MIs and Us and Vs.

"
"

  All features are very good but the main thing is performance of this phone is not so well, it restarts automatically any time and also keyboard is not working well...very disappointed so I return this. And self return during lockdown is also very disappointing. I really hate the service provided by Amazon.

"
"

  I love to use ui of this phone. Display is good not so great. Fingerprint reader is not so smooth. Camera is average. Highly disappointed with selfie camera. Battery is really monster.  Value for money 4GB 64gb not 6/128gb. I recommend for budget buyers.

"
"

  Its an awesome smartphoneEverything is working perfectly even the battery life is just amazing and the camera is just awesome i dont even have words to explain thatAnd the processor is ok it works perfectly for my every workI can play games and do anything i want with it

"
"

  The phone appears to be good.i bought it about 15 days back through Amazon but had very bad experience.The screen got cracked at many places when the phone was put on the table with a little force by my 3 year old child.What could I do.I thought it had corning gorilla glass and will not get damage so easily.Very sad.

"
"

  When I insert my SD card it's not get properly fit into the sim tray..

"
"

  The camera quality isn't taht good...i have one more phone of 48mp..but its wayy better...after using for 2 months..started lagging badly..heats up after using for 30 minutes

"
"

  Build quality very bad ...not satisfied(amazon not accepting return) amazon pls take necessary action for return

"
"

  Overall I give a good for this phone , finger print works well but if your finger is wet it won't open the screen lock , camera is good . Over all I give a 4 star for this product.  Value for money.

"
"

  Good product, great screen and huge battery backup. Made in India phone with nice futures and no frill UI.

"
"

  If you are planning to have phone under 15000/- then buying this phone would be the best decision you ever had without sharing your personal data with Chinese servers. With that you will get one of the best Mobile brand with you. And another best thing is it us available in exchange.

"
"

  GoodBattery backupPerformanceBadFast charging :D takes more then 2 hours to full chargeDisplay pixels are not upto the mark, colors are goodFingerprint sensor is not accurate. many of the times it does not detect and makes me irritate

"
"

  Don't expect this type of faulty product got delivered to me from Amazon. Finger print reader sometimes won't work. Camera quality is not good. While playing pubg it lags and screen get stuck in between. Battery backup is 7 to 8 hrs of continuous usage.

"
"

  Buy on Samsung website  because seller not give good product

"
"

  Very good screen and battery in this segment. Very useful to students for online classes.bi also brought for this mobile for same reason to my nephew.

"
"

  Very nice phone along with all features. Very long battery life. Awesome  camera, perfect memory, nice volume, awesome display, and all round perfect phone in comparison of other phone. It is best. Thank you amazone

"
"

  Best product but only one CON and that is RAM IS almost full. even in a new phone without any 3rd party app  . 4out of 3 gbs are always filled

"
"

  This phone installs apps automatically, it came with blot-ware installed. Even after uninstalling the preloaded apps the mobile still trying to force install them automatically.Do not buy this one if you are trying to have control on your phone. Try any other pure android phones.

"
"

  This is one of the best smartphone in this price range.The best part of this phone is the battery and the screen which make this phone a worth buying. The camera is also pretty good.I purchased this because of the trust on the brand and its service. Which you find always better than other companies.

"
"

  Excellent touch sensitivity, very easy to operate, battery backup is good,camera quality is very good.Only there is issue with very minor gaps between front camera and housing,due to which dust particles can easily move into the phone and camera module.Overall excellent phone within budget.

"
"

  Totally monstrous  all rounderVery good compitetor of mi realms oppo vivoAnd one last thing it's made in South KoreaSo u shouldn't support  made in China phones

"
"

  Galaxy m 21 is one of the best phone in this price range samsung has launched this is value for money there is no any complaints till date i am using it since last one week. battery life and camera quality is awesome.

"
"

  I am searching for mobile as my old mobile is broke (samsung j2 2016). I found this all in one mobile with Big Battery and Amazing Display. 6000mah battery last for 2 days of uses. 6.40 inch display is amazing. Camera is also very Good to take Picture 48+8+5 MP and for selfies 20MP. I am happy with this Mobile.

"
"

  Good quality phone at an excellent price. Very good camera, battery life is one and a half days with normal use, I had expected it would last two days.

"
"

  Everything is good except Galaxy Store. Apps from galaxy store are outdated and apps are auto downloaded, users have no control on them.  Thank you Samsung India for the awesome product.

"
"

  Lovely product.....all performance testing are above expectations..... PUBG gameplay was OP ..... Most Imp. Thing is the SAMSUNG Galaxy from India... M seriesüòòüòò.....OPTIONAL fast charging... I like it!!..... üîã Battery was LONG LASTING!!.. Camera.... Video stabilizer was too pretty!!

"
"

  Good budget smart phone.Awesome batter life.Camera quality good in day time ..but night time it need more quality.Screen resolution is amazing for this budget.Fingerprint reader have good sensing abilitiesCharge time is little high.Refresh speed is good

"
"

  Overall product is very good. Battery life should have been when one considers it to be of 6000 maH. Toch is sensitive but using screen guard is highly recommended by me. Use of cover for this phone is must.

"
"

  After price hiked of mobile phones The  samsung M 21 this only model available with Supe AMOLED Display and 9611 Exynos in this Rs,14000 /-range. I got a good exchange value for my OPPO a3s for 4,400/-,I thought it's really good deal. Thanks to Amazon

"
"

  Camera quality not good as it is 48mp. Redmi 5a 13mp camera quality is better than this

"
"

  I'm really satisfied with the product. The battery is gr8 and the camera quality is also nice.And if you are searching for a phone having everything excellent.  Then go and buy this phone.I'm sure that you will not be dissapointed.Enjoy your purchasing...üòä

"
"

  Since its 48 MP i though the camera will be great. but i totally disappointed.. it just looks 12 MP camera. Very bad quality pictures. But its better in this price range. Performance also ok. Battery is average..

"
"

  Network issues. Please solve this problem........

"
"

  Battery is really powerful.Once fully charged, lasts for more than 1 day even if used continuously.Camera quality is good.Pubg runs very smoothly when game booster is on.Display is awesome,many amazing hidden features. So many features at this cost is wonderful.

"
"

  Very nice phone and a good comeback by Samsung. Very good battery backup,  best camera. Overall value for money.Only issue is with the auto brightness which doesn't work sometimes

"
"

  For day to day life this phone is really awesome. Specially screen and camera are just superb.  But when it comes to gaming or any other kind of hard processing things, it becomes average, it can't produce that much of good gaming experience. But overall I will rate this product  8 out of 100.

"
"

  ¬†There is no pouch ,no pre applied tempers glass.. back poly carbonate body not glass body.. remaining all good...worth the cost 14k..

"
"

  Dont buy this it's Charging speed is really slow it takes around 4""30 to 5 hours to charge o%to100% and you will notice alot of lag in 6/128 also . I was thinking to not purchase non-Indian phone but again I had made I mistake to take samsung I would like to recommend you poco m2 pro at this price

"
"

  Hi all,Should go for Samsung m21, which is the best mobile you can grab in mid budget variant. I been using this for the last ten days and I didn't find any issues except heating issue while using games with data. Apart from heating issues rest all fine. Thanks

"
"

  Its a great product in the price range....the camera quality its just amazing the AI of the camera is really good ....the display is really colourfull and punchy .....the battery goes easily through out the day...overall its a great product and especially its not a Chinese brand...(‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢)

"
"

  After using the phone for one week I can assure anyone of the battery  life . It lasts almost 48 hours . The üì∑ quality is good . Its pretty fast with the 6GB RAM . Built wise its good . Sometimes the touch doesn't work properly . At this budget it's the best phone Samsung is offering .

"
"

  Camera is supercool as 48 MP camera let's you take  great pictures.  Battery is monstrous  as 6000mh. Fingerprint and face unlock is additional cool features.Overall I am in complete in love with this phone at this price...Thanks Samsung.Thanks Amazon too for fast delivery...üòÑüòÑüòÑ

"
"

  Probably Best phone in this segmentIt has a brand value ofcourse which matters ,Coming to the phoneBuild quality is awesome,  Camera is superb,  Display is awesome too.It's been a week I didn't find any cones .

"
"

  Screen  is excellentMain ONE UI is fantasticBattery is awesomeCamera is goodOver all performance  decentIf u r not heavy  gammer blindly go for itNotmal games are handle very smooth

"
"

  Bought this Phone for my Father.. it's worth the Value and Battery life is good and qulaity of Camera and it's feature are good too...

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is good and work properly , battery life is also fine but don't overcharge it otherwise battery quality will get affected, camera is decent even in pro mode , camera quality is needed some improvisations and ads are not good it really irritating sometimes

"
"

  Mobile hang and charging tooo late

"
"

  I bought this phone 15 may ,I received 19 may this phone quality is good but fingerprint sensor is crack left side and move around the fingerprint sensor is not fixed exact place . please care full every one

"
"

  I just buy samsung galaxy m21 raven black, 1st of all I say colour was awesome, size was perfect and hav grip, now the camera was so much awesome  48 mp rear, photos look like real, and this is also due to super AMOLED screen ...touch sensor works smoothly.... overall I am so happy to buy this mobile in this budget.

"
"

  Dnt buy chinese brands. Not good quality

"
"

  I bought this phone 7 days ago. And i am not satisfied with this product. Because it hangs on every time. And worst part is network issues. Very low network speed .....and the network stops working completely any time....while at the same time other phones have very good network speed.

"
"

  Used may Samsung phones but this one is fast, reliable, smooth, easy to use, excellent batt life with fast charging and value for money also in comparison with my last phone mi note 5 pro.It has a plastic body but screen clarity is great and also plays high graphic games smoothly

"
"

  My phone display broken within 2 month without external damage and display of M21 not available in any service centre. Meanwhile I know that, Due to bad quality of display, company stop send display to their service centre.Stay away from M series because all phone have same issue

"
"

  The mobile is super with triple camera quality and fingerprint sensor and face print recognisation  is also fast and also it has an option to record screen who want to record our game , this mobile is will take 1hour to full charge. For kids is best mobile in low range who are attending online classes

"
"

  Samsung m21 was so cool.Camera function was good and wide angle shots are perfect and nice.Past Fingerprint reader.Good battery life.Display super for watch 1080p quality videos.Dolby Atmos sound super for while watching movies.Selfie focus too good.

"
"

  Best phone under 15k ....the best part about the phone is the battery backup and amoled screen ......i bought it because of the battery life.....and its pretty impressive....the camera quality is a good and you can  also download filter instantly.....it can give you 2 days battey backup if you are a decent user

"
"

  I am using this phone since last one month. Very good phone. I didn't  face any problem in this phone. With 6000 mAh battery long lasting battery life. It has very good camera , good picture quality compared to Chinese phones. Big screen, sharp display. Overall it a good non-Chinese phone in 15999.

"
"

  Build quality is good and phone works like butter chicken.

"
"

  Stands true to the claims mentioned on the site. Powerful battery,  good performance and an awesome camera. A very good phone on mid-range budget. I am happy with the performance so far. Only problem is the charging time but that gets outweighed with the many plus points that it has.

"
"

  Amazing phone go for it one of the best purchased i made it is been a month it is working fantastic with all amzing features u will get under 13k go for this if your looking for less budget this phone is superb

"
"

  It's one of the gorgeous phone which I use till the date....its ""Battery life"" is monsters""Camera quality"" is amazing""Fingerprints readers"" is very fastDisplay is also amazingLittle bit hang in last one month 1 or 2 timesBut at last phone is goodMy review is 4.5/5

"
"

  Nice product!One of nice product of samsung like lots of high mode feature are there in such price.Bettery 6000mh, main camera 48 mp, tripple rear camera etc and obviously samsung touch feel is amazing.

"
"

  Video quality still need some improvement.It is very good quality in net surfacing and very responsive on operating in between the applications.I like it very much and excited to have it in low budget with great storage.Regards:PAWAN NAG. HAPPY Customer  having GALAXY M21

"
"

  1. Taking long time to full Battery charge, Around 4-5 hours.  and it's running time is 20 hours only.2. All headphone not working with this mobile.3. Camera quality is good but not feel like 48 mp.Apart from that Mobile is good.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is good smart photo in the budget. Its camera quality is also good which has wide angle camera. Phone has good sound quality and good clearity.But I found that the screen is little yellowish if compared with MI phones.Overall this is a good product.

"
"

  Good phone. Nice battery life. Good for little-average users/ gamers. Value for money. Will recommend to others looking in this price range, for sure..!!

"
"

  Awesome camera and battery and also fingerprint reador. The 48mp camera captures awesome pictures and help me to recollect my memories. The fingerprint reader makes my phone unlock easily just with a touch. The 6000mah battery lasts long as I can use it for more than a day

"
"

  The display is awsum and you will never get this display clearity on any other brand in this price range and the camera quality is also gud..And for normal daily use the processor is good and battery life 6000mah is so good so that you can use 1 and half day normally

"
"

  The phone is awesome with a great camera. The resolution is very very clear and the screen operates super smoothly. I am very satisfied with the phone and the price which I got it for . With an increase in my budget in future I would surely like to try only Samsung phones!

"
"

  Awesome screen, Awesome camera, long lasting battery life.Wish auto-brightness worked consistently. It randomly goes up and down for no reason.

"
"

  Battery backup is very poor, and return process is not easy, i don't find right option to just return/replace thismobile, it asks many steps to do..i just want to replace but not finding easy options..

"
"

  Amazing.I am a moto g5 plus owner . I bought m21 for my father . Camera features are superb . Battery backup  2 days of heavy use. Very easy to use .Should use 4k tv for the quality check. I am also planning to buy these phone for my mother.It's Samsung guys, never disappoint you !

"
"

  Its battery is really beast it works for almost 2 days at normal usage gaming is fine for continuous 2 hrs game then it become little choppy. camera is not much good but face recognition is faster than any phone i had used. its overall a best non chinese phone under 15000

"
"

  Battery life very bad in this device, I was fully charged  this morning  only I use device 2 hours battery  was empty

"
"

  Finger print was not working properly,Wrong Location was showing alwaysPoor quality cameraDisplay was good looking.I returned

  Samsung Galaxy m21 is the Money  value.Camera  best and battery  is  6000mahBut not good service,  battery life  11 hours only.And charging  time 2.5hr.

"
"

  Awesome display Super AMOLEDCamera quality is good15watt charging support 6000mah battery you can use whole dayfull charging time 2hr+One UI makes this phone next level in this budget

"
"

  Epic phone in this priceGreat battery life and monster cameraBut 1 thing is disappointing that its camera too much lags...Even when just take a single click.If you want to shift from 1 mode to another OMG it struggles too much.I hope this will fix in a software update.

"
"

  Dnt even try to buy this phone. I have purchased this phone twice and in both time there was a display problem which eventually turned out to be a manufacturing defect. So try not to buy because in the customer service center also many people I encountered were facing the touch issue.

"
"

  Very Good Mobile to buy in your Budget... I'm so happy to bought this mobile .. This phone contains Lot of Excellent Features .. If u buy this mobile you ll never get disappointment.. Attractive Display! Very Smooth Functions... I love this Mobile !! Best phone I never used before ...

"
"

  Its a good mobile in budget. 6000mAh battery giving a better perfomance, camera is good but little bit lower than china brand, finger print reader works smooth..... satisfied with the looking, big size display and perfomance.... like this product....& recommending you to buy this product....

"
"

  ¬†One of d worst phone everyWorst serviceWorst phonePoor den poorest deal n product by Amazon.....Feeling cheated ....

"
"

  Best device in this budget.Huge battery, it last longs a whole day with extreme uses.Great display and camera.But, there is a security issue, Knox Security is not available, Although McAfee security is available which is also a better option.Although this is a great phone with great price.

"
"

  I saw the review and bought it.Phone quality is not good.Voice is not so clear. I thought to return.. the return window got over yesterday. I didn't realize. The window is only one week. It was 15 days.Please return your phone immediately if you see any issue.

"
"

  I am giving my review after 4 days of usage.Two main features are not upto the mark.1. Camera Quality is very bad both front and Rear2. Fast charging is like normal charging only. No Fast charging.Remaining are OK. As of now.

"
"

  The Samsung m21 raven black mobile phone is very good and the battery is superb 6k mAh camera is good , processors is also good for every task but the charging time is to long if we get the 33W fast charging then the mobile gonna break all the records in smartphone market under the nominal price

"
"

  I used this mobile since 1 month , no bugs were identified.  Best budget mobile phone for this era , barring games...a perfect mobile , charging stands 1 and half day, camera: front cam pixels much rather than back cam. Fingerprint  sensor seems proactive.  So finally value for money.

"
"

  The so called fast charger is not so fast.

"
"

  BATTERY LIFE IS  REALLY VERY GOOD. AS USUAL THIS IS SAMSUNG SO NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT CAMERA.... ITS GOOD....

"
"

  The screen is superb  with epic camera what more can you ask üòÅ. If you are considering to buy it just goooo for it don't  think. The UI is also super cool if you haven't  used the Samsung phone  before start with this one and you are not going back to other brand.

"
"

  This is it.One of the best budget smartphones in 2020. No point in bragging about the specs it's all in the description.Insert joke: Fingerprint reader is ready, battery life is worth living and camera quality is beyond equality.Pleased with my purchase.

"
"

  I would like to say that phone is pretty decentin for day to day operations but hangs at times.Battery is big which makes the phone heavy and is bulky also.Speaker volume could have been better.

"
"

  Actually it's design attracts  me .it's too handy .Simply takes beautiful photos .Good battery backup.Functions smoothly.Comes with Samoled screen which gives a better video experience.In short it's just awesome product. Go for it

"
"

  I would say it's awesome in its battery power and touch sensitivity. Smooth and wonderful user interface. Camera clarity is stunning.But Iam not satisfied with the selfie camera gives a little distortion in the Image.

"
"

  Camera performance is excellent. Fingerprint reader is good. Display performance is very good compare to another. Battery life is good and depend on uses.Overall is best Handset within value of money.

"
"

  I really love this phone just because of monster battery in a budget phone, and the display is really waaoooo super AMOLED full HD display in budget amount. Wide angle camera is also very good to take a beautifull pictures. I am fully satisfied with this Samsung m21 phone. I love it.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is a bit slow but OK.Camera is goodThis set is not for high level gaming but small games are OK.Though I have 6gb ram but not not so fast in performance.As an alternative to Chinese phones this is the best option.Camera is really good.

"
"

  Facing problem in whatsapp calling every time call disconnect showing message ""Reconnecting"".....please provide solution

"
"

  I bought this Mobile 28th may..my honest opinion about this mobile is that..its battery life is good at least 12..13 hours  continuous use..1%battery drain takes 7minutes..camera is average..but today face its speaker problem (unclear voice) after reboot..is this problem happening with anyone? ...please tell me.

"
"

  Awesome cam quality, awesome battery life and awesome display quality. The only problem is the softwares aren't updated and you're supposed to update all of them including the system updates. But otherwise, love it :)

"
"

  -great battery,-great camera-smooth interface-quick charging-though screen is large didnt feel large in hand, easy handling

"
"

  Don't buy, Go for Vivo, One Plus or Iphone

"
"

  The best budget phone at Samsung side with great features, the amoled screen just amazing with good colours and contrast , battery is amazing .One ui is the reason it way better than other phone software , so minimalistic

"
"

  Nice phone for this price. A value for money product. Back Camera is nice, however front camera is not so good. else one can surely take this one as an option against other brands with same price range.

"
"

  Galaxy m21 is really a very good smartphone i am using it from past 1 month and really its a very good phone without any ads and it is also a non chinese brand  with very low sar value i am using samsung from 10 years and i found samsung a very great company

"
"

  Literally, the Best phone in this segment. And I want to tell only one thing that Do Not Get Attracted By New Features Which Are Provided By The Smartphone Companies Now-a-days, but FALL IN LOVE WITH THE TRUE REQUIRED LOVABLE FEATURE WHICH ARE PROVIDED BY SAMSUNG . HEY SAMSUNG , GREAT WORK !üëç

"
"

  The camera quality is what i want it's better in this budget some camrera features were new to me , battery backup is osum , sensors are precise and it is working smooth provided ur care too decide .Furthur if any technical malfunctioning would have I will update .

"
"

  I've purchased this product in ‚Çπ13k only by exchange offer and it was delivered within 24 hours(for my location). Package was good. Awesome product. Samsung need to work little more for the camera quality of samaung M21 and you can trust the seller STPL Exclusive online.

"
"

  Samsung phones  i like this, befor 6 year to use only samsung phone, Samsung phonse camera is very clean photo and perfact  pic.

"
"

  Its a week since I have been waiting for the Return of the product but no response from your end I shall be approaching the consumer forum if I get no response from your end as the product is defective and I had been complaining repeatedly contact me in 9830777443.and do the needful

"
"

  Everything is Great about this Phone. Specially the Full HD+ Super AMOLED Display. Its best in class. The only CON I noticed, sometimes during heavy usage, the top front side near camera and fingerprint scanner, the phone heats up.

"
"

  The best phone from Samsung that you can buy, in the 10000/- to 20000/- segment, if you don't want the additional fourth camera and are ok with the 3 cameras then this is the best that you can buy, as it has all the same specs that a 25000/- Samsung phone offers

"
"

  This is the worst product I purchased from Amazon, I got it on 27 Aug 2020 and on 7 sep 2020, it started blinking and screen turned black. Now it is not switching on. What to do now? Plz help. Amazon is best known for delivering duplicate mobiles. I request not to buy mobiles from Amazon

"
"

  Battery is not perfect as much as they showing, not enough backup for 6000 mah, i think it is performs like a 4500 mah batteryIf it is 6000 mah battery needs to improveCamera quality is goodFingerprint also goodDisplay is quality excellent

"
"

  Please don't buy this set .Due to following reasons-1 processor is very low as compare to snapdragon is this price range.2 If you are a pubg users then this is a worst phone to buy.3 camera quality is adequate but not good.4 instead of this set you can go for REALME 6

"
"

  I Never expect this from international brand like Samsung......highly unsatisfied worthless......improper finishes....heating issues is high.....charging time is high....please don't waste ur money.....

"
"

  It's great feature Mobile in just 14000/-,absolutely  works like a higher end phone, pic quality is great both rear and front, gaming experience  also awesome, battery goes for long life after playing game too. Experience is awesome. Amazon delivered in just 3 Days which is awesome.

"
"

  After 2 months of usage, I have found:1. Battery life is really good.2. Camera is okay, not the best in this range.3.Super smooth usage.4. Charging is slow, but long lasting.5. One UI is best.Overall it is good for normal usage. You won't face any issues.

"
"

  I have received the damaged Samsung Galaxy M21 from Amazon. And the worst is that their customer service executives are not supportive at all. Even one can not buy new mobile by exchanging this handset. So please please please don't buy it from Amazon. Not just mobile but any electronic item.

"
"

  Impressed with the performance  and battery backup. Light weight and heating of phone during usage was not observed, that is the problem  with my old phone.. good alternative  purchase for other leading Chinese mobile....

"
"

  I love this phone. I was not looking for this segment of phone but read the features of M21 and decided to take it due to below reasons,1. Nice look2. Cool touch experience3. Good camera quality4. Battery life5. Fingerprints reader is also good

"
"

  Beast battery-6000Mah with 48-megapixels camera and dolbyatmos sound .Superamoled display is better. Smooth fingerprints touch. Build quality is super.At the range of 14000 this phone is a masterpiece by Samsung. Must go for it without any question.

"
"

  Display quality is not as good as expected or as promised. And camera quality is very low. But battery is good. I think build quality it not so good. Not premium looking purchase glass body. It comes with fibre body. I think value of money is low.

"
"

  Everything is ok except camera quality,  not upto the mark camera quality as other brands offer better camera in this price segment as i compare my some friends other brands mobile...

"
"

  The product is amazing samsung has done a great job this time that was unexpected but i did not feel this for Amazon because when the product reached me the package even the modile box was teared badly.So this is my opinion that amazon should improve its delivery services.Thank you.

"
"

  worst camera quality don't buy samsung M21.don't buy electronics  from amazon as they sell defective products and don't replace / refund this product on complaint

"
"

  OTG is supporting fr m21 ?

"
"

  Camera and battery is excellent body design is lovely looks expensive perfect phone in this budget..........Beter performance and picture quality in camera.

"
"

  Battery life excellent, camera quality also fantastic fingerprint reader fast but no fingerprint lock for apps so u hav to download applock from play store for this device this is the only issue with the mob , other wise value for money

"
"

  I bought it for my brother and he really loved it. a very good phone with good specifications  in a very reasonable price. Just go for it.

"
"

  It is worst service they give a defected peace in term of software.my phone is hang continuous and fingerprint is also not working. There costumer service is also worst.

"
"

  Very good phone. Excellent display. Performance os satisfactory.  Camera is also good although  the front camera can be improved. Biometrics work fone. Reliability  of Samsung  makes it a very good puchase at the price of 12699/- At this price you cant get a better phone

"
"

  Processor too goodBattery too goodDisplay amazingErgonomics bestCamera amazingConnectivity and performance best ..Accessories too good ...Best finding in budget

"
"

  Otherwise good. Low camera quality. Not at par with marketed 48 mega pixel camera. Sensor is ok. Over all not very satisfactory, price should be in range of 12k maximum.

"
"

  Samsung galaxy m21 has a great battery life and camera quality is satisfactory. It has sAMOLED display and Dolby atmos which makes movie experience amazing...Overall the phone is in budget with very good features...it is good for day to day usage...but it's not a phone for heavy gaming.

"
"

  Don't buy this product I have ordered this product on June 5 it came on 14 june2020 after 12 days I.e,26 june 2020 they have refunded or return by seller with out my permission the seller is behaving  foolish product is nice but issue with seller

"
"

  Very bad packaging, i am really disappointed by camera quality. Its mentioned 20mp front camera but it gives picture quantity of 8mp. Battery life is good . Its back is of plastic and takes fingerprints which is irritating. You just can't expect best from low budget Samsung phones.

"
"

  This phone  is way slower compared to other phones of same 4gb ram. Example it takes too much time to update in play store, slow response to internet pages loading while it is connected to high speed broadband.  Disappointed.  I didn't want to buy a Chinese phone, so I bought this.

"
"

  This phone is really a admirable phone at this cost and I love this phone's battery life and camera. I use this phone for playing games and watching videos for 5 to 6 hours and this phone stuck very rarely which is a small minus but overall this is a great phone and I recommend it.

"
"

  Using from last 15 days. Over heating issue during video call and voice call after battery recharging. I spent 16000/- for this and disappointing whenever using this. If anyone want to buy tension and disappointment, then only buy this phone.

"
"

  samsung is meant for super amoled display except that there is nothing much in this phone performance is very poor. only buy this if you are not multitasker nor a game lover. best for parents for day to day whatsapp and other social media.

"
"

  In this range you can get better phone.. i mean they are giving 48 mp camera but picture quality sucks..Whenever i pick up a call it takes 4 5 sec to start it just gets hanged.Notification security not provided in this phone which is very basic featureHeat up issue is also there

"
"

  This is a great phone with grt camera and especially battery . 6000Mah is made by only one brand - samsung . Hats off to u samsung. Talking about its workings , its a grt phn and gd from gamer like me. At last I would say who is willing to take this phn just go ahead you are dealing a grt choice

"
"

  Stock android needed.Unwanted preinstalled app should be avoided.Feel lag while scrollRefreshing Sim data notification is annoying.Camera goodFinger print fastBattery  life best in segment.

"
"

  In this price range this is one of the best option, U get a trusted brand Samsung . Best phone U can go for it .

"
"

  Don't buy this phone if you are going to buy.  I received my phone on 1st June.  On 2nd June almost all the function stop to work and on 4th ( Today) touch is stopped to work... Please don't buy it...

"
"

  I have been satisfied  but probably there is major issue in galaxy m21 youtube vedios are playing in maximum 480 resolution  I have confused more than desperate this handset have a uhd amoled display but youtube vedios are playing  only in 480 resolution  please help me if my phone have any problem

"
"

  Such a dull display, not expected from Samsung.Event thought its Amoled.One plus and MI are trying very hard on giving quality whereas Samsung just trying to survive on brand name.At this price point MI is giving you Snapdragon with equal ram size and better battery and display quality.

"
"

  6000mAh battery life.. I can watch online classes without any delay, it also provide Smart view, good AMOLED display.. Settings are user friendly..fast face sensor ,camera quality is good but video quality is less compare to M31 It's a budget phone for normal users

"
"

  DisappointedAfter 6 days of use started hangInstalled only lite version useful apps only even then hanging problemNot at all fast chargingBattery life 1&1/2 day after extensive use in call, video recording,  video conferencing

"
"

  It's been a week since I am using this phone it's awesome no lagging no network issues the phone is nice in look and very slim though size is a bit bigger but it have features that resolve this size issue ,so it's a nice phone you can go for it ...

"
"

  Bad Network quality, signal strength low.

"
"

  Everything is good but I have one issue on mobile many time I checked it's restart without any reason ..I gifted this mobile to my brother .he said when I m at calling or useing game this phone automatically switch  of and on I don't know why????

"
"

  What a performance I'm so much happy from this phone thank you samsung for great features this is my 2nd phone in 6 months i bought for my family that's great performance of phone guy's if any one planning for new phone buy Samsung M series or A series,  both are good.

"
"

  I bought it for my father one month before...i used for first 10days for installing and updating etc..performance not bad...battery life for my use 2 days...my father use it comes almost 4 days of battery life...display is a major boost...sound loud...pretty neet decent phone...

"
"

  Its a good product, with good battery, camera,display and signal reception. Samsung should try to reduce the price to counter the other Chinese rivals.

"
"

  Samsung, make believe  to use safe and smoothly work flow.Battery improved...Camera also good...Functional  work is smooth with Ram and storage...Average  look from back, can much more appreciable...Rest all is perfect...take as brand valuable product.

"
"

  Long lasting battery, with amoled display,  i love this,Performance 5/5Battery life 5/5Fingerprint reader 5/5Face unlock 5/5Display 5/5Camera quality 4/5Everythings is very well conditions.....I love Raven black color very attractive ‚ù£Ô∏è

"
"

  Best Samsung phone at this price range.Good performanceBest camera quality  48Mp monster camFingerprint sensor working very fastGood battery lifeBrilliant SUPER Amoled display gives the best viewing experience and got features like Samsung premium range mobiles.

"
"

  After two months of purchase it's giving problem. It's getting hang, unable slide to receive the call. Need to press harder to open any app. I thought instead of buying chinese phone should buy Samsung but big disoppointed. It would have been better if I bought the realme or vivo.

"
"

  ¬†Best Budget Phone In IndiaBrilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a shame that this phone's launch was delayed due to lockdown.Highly Recommended phone.

"
"

  It has poor internet speed my another realme mobile is giving speed of 20 mbps and this mobile is giving not more than 1 mbps and i have contacted amazon customer service also worst they assigned a tection after 15 days of delivery it's totally waste of time to me. Customer support is poor.

"
"

  Battery, camera,display fingerprint and all function of this phone are awesome and you should buy it .If you are looking phone under 14000 this is great.And you also compare this Mobile with 15 or 16 thousand. And you found better this.

"
"

  Fast fingerprint Sensor,battery life is good, charging speed low. Take 3 hours for complete charge. Camera quality is good according to price.

"
"

  Battery life and camera quality very good.Efficient smart phone as high internal memory and quick processing system.Lets see its consistency over use able period ahead.

"
"

  Phone good looking, phone had heating issue while charging and camera is not up to the mark because it make more brighter then original image .

"
"

  I purchased Samsung Galaxy M21 on 18 may 2020. It is very good product I like many features of this phone like battery capacity is very strong and camera is very good and best of this phone super amoled display. It is very simple shape and size and it is not bulky. Nowadays it is working properly.

"
"

  Bought this mobile for a change but totally not upto the mark.instead m31 was far away better than this mobile .overHeating issue on the first day of delivery  and at the time of charging also.beside touch screen doesn't respond quickly  and if respond it's not stable..really disappointed

"
"

  The product is overall good but there is heating issue from the very first day, but only a little.Editing(5/10/2020): After the software update, the problems such as lagging in camera app and minor heating issues have been resolved.  Best phone in this range, must go for it.

  Hi this is Irfan Hashmi today  i got this phone &when i open and using  this phone I'm totally  unhappy with this this phone suddenly hitting and voice quality is very poor when I called to customers support they told me sir plz update you phone but still some problem west of money plaza Don't but this phone

"
"

  This mobile is hanging up frequently and also dropping voice levels and going silent for few seconds. Which is an itching thing of Samsung M21

"
"

  Software downloading speed is very slow

"
"

  Pls dont buy this. Its heating like a iron box. We cannot make a call for 5 minutes due to hevy heating on the screen panel, particularly in earpiece area. I was a regular customer of samsung, but this time they came with a bad one

"
"

  The looks and feels good.. but just a month it is not switching on.. I gabe to service they said charging port may gone.. I did not expect such poor quality from samsung.. hope this kind of issue will not happen in future..

"
"

  Taking log time to save 48 MP photos. Also, after using MIUI I missed lots of features like Screen recording,  Dual apps, Dual space. I would say MIUI is the best ui till now.I found hitting issue as well also camera interface is good.Very bad experience.

"
"

  I have received my phone yesterday the touch of my phone is not working, I am unable to return or replace it.I am also not able to connect to the customer support I need phone urgently plz help

"
"

  It's a completely budget phone, don't expect much as per price range with S.amloed its good mobile. Performance and other specifications are just good.this phone is not for gamers.

"
"

  I satisfied.Its really superbI used it for 10 days and giving reviews, so that charging is good.But screen card ,skin,case should be bought for secure.I observed that face recognization is some what clumsy.Not identifying quickly.Apart from that it's all good .

"
"

  On very next day of delivery it's Navigation Bar stop working and 4th day display also stop working. I have requested for return / replacement on 18th July'20 but 4 days passed but no response by amazon or seller.One month passed but still issue not resolved.

"
"

  Worth every penny.1. Huge storage2. Huge RAM3. Super speed response4. Excellent Display5. Touch feel and response is awesome.6. No lag while playing PUBG7. Light weight8. Consistent Network connectivityNo cons observed so far...

"
"

  Sound output without earphones is bad compared to other phones like mi and motorola.Body is cheap plastic.Only thing samsung outperforms other budget phones is with s-amoled screen.Motorola is far better than Samsung but only problem is it's Chinese company now.

"
"

  Fingerprint  work good but read slow than other deviceBattery life is less than expected( as for 6000mah) but it is pretty  good and charging Time is approx 2 and half hour.Camara quality is good.There is heating problem when you charge you phone and on hotspot.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is a value for money product with study outlook. The battery life is worth experiencing. And the figer print sensor is smooth to use. The camera works quite well both with light and without light in the dark. Buy it if you are looking for a good phone at a good price.

"
"

  Very good product, delevered in good condition, best price range smart phone go for mid night blue..touch is smooth,fingerprint is fastets,selfie n rearfie is superb but one con is some small scratches on back on down side otherwise smart phone is superb go for it blindly..review written after 5 days of use

"
"

  It's good at this price range..I didn't find in issue as of now..After using 4 days.My only concern is when I connected to wifi it has auto download the Tik-tok and other few Apps

"
"

  6000 mah battery is a real deal it works for 2 days without changing. The display is wonderful to watch all your favourite movies and TV series best display at given price point. The camera quality is unquestionable 48 mega pixels kills it. Here is some same pictures hope u all guys enjoy it.

"
"

  Fabulous product in this price range . Worth a must buy . The best phone in such a lower price . Excellent camera quality and long life battery with a high ram . Just loved it . Thank you Samsung and Amazon .

"
"

  Tnq Amazon for the safe product delivery....this is my fst order on Amazon n pretty much satisfied...u guys r really  working hard in this pandemic  to meet the needs of every customer...cmg to mobile the  battery is really a monster n I'm loving it. N also the camera. Everything is Good.

"
"

  Superb ...The Galaxy M21 offers an AMOLED screen, 6000mAh battery, a decent amount of RAM and storage, Fast biometric unlock and of course, Samsung branding. PUBG runs in HD graphics and High frame rate. The gameplay is better in Smooth-extreme. Thanks to Samsung, Thanks to Amazon for fast delivery in lockdown

"
"

  Big Screen, Big Battery 6000 mAh, Nice Exynos Processor And Triple Camera on Back Side and Amazing Front Side Selfie CameraWith Amazing Quality.

"
"

  Excellent battery backup stands upto 3 full days for my lite use, good Amoled display in this range with samsung brand. I got it for Rs.9500 with exchange. Some times face detector 3 out of 10 not working.

"
"

  The phone is good. But the issues I face are that it takes a lot of time to charge.  Approximately 2 hours even when I am not using the phone in that duration. Also sometimes the keypad hangs suddenly and it takes approximately 5-7 minutes for it to act normally again.

"
"

  Phone very good battery life with superior processor makes it to handle heavy multitasking. Super AMOLED display makes display more likeable in this price segment.Value for money. Camera quality is awesome ane can able to shoot HD videos with great stability. Good to buy

"
"

  Its amazing that I have taken 2units of it for my bro and for me everything working fine but sometimes it is stucking while opening chrome apart from that it's an amazing product at the given price and one more thing that I loved most is it is made in india product recommend this for everyone.

"
"

  The fingerprint of this phone is excellent.And also the battery life of the mobile is fabulous.And camara of the mobile is increadable.I am very lucky to buy this product.and other facilities of the mobile is also useful for me. I hope you should buy it and enjoy the features with mobile.

"
"

  Great phone for the price...competes with phones around the 15000 mark big battery,Dolbyaudio , SAMOLED screen and camera are good for the price.. fingerprints, everything is perfect... must buy... really  loved a lot..

"
"

  Camera is moderately okie...samsung sensor is not good..my previous phone had Sony sensor and the images taken on that had more detailing.Superb battery backup 6000mah.Samloed display is also superbProcessor is also not bad.No screen recorder.

"
"

  Best product at this price range... Awesome performance  finger print very fast.. camera quality good.. display very good super amoled nailed it blindly go for it

"
"

  Excellent product of SamsungThanks to Amazon to provide better product as well as better quality of this item and another itemsI believe this only on Amazon to get a quality products..... thanks to Amazon to safely delivery and early delivery from delivery date.....ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©

"
"

  Great in department of Battery, Super AMOLED screen, almost ad-free UI experience, weight distribution. Good for this budget but need some improvement in Camera department. Great for day to day user, travellers (great battery), Multimedia and Social Media. Heavy Gamers should avoid.

"
"

  Worst experience buying from amazon. Never go for online mobile purchase. I repeat never! Instead of M series..one should go for A series. M series idls totally waste of time nd money.

"
"

  When we got the phone at starting onwards due to some software problems, the phone was not functioning properly. Now we add new software so now it is all functioning good. We  had to pay in shop extra Rs 350 to change the software of this phone.

"
"

  good product but needs improvement on speaker even at high volume output is not enoughNo headphones to start FM radio or talk , should have provided by charging Rs 300-400 more

"
"

  Worked very well till one week and there after started annoying in every single day. Getting switched off innumerable time in a day and worst part is technical support from Samsung. They deserve legal case in every aspects. Amazon is involved with them and they sent me usable phone.

"
"

  Front camera is so good but back camera is not up toh the mark. Battery is not so good for gaming for children l suggest not to take this mobile because this  is not A gaming mobile..

"
"

  Plz dont buy it.. This is the worst phone i have ever bought... Plz its a request dont waste your money by buying this product... The services provided by Samsung it also worst... Go for redmi, vivo, oppo instead... Dont even believe in good comments thy give money to write good comments

"
"

  Over all phone is good but you are expecting more in this price section Samsung should get note that camera quality is not up to mark as per battery concern backup is good. Fingerprint sensor is quick responded display was amazing but Samsung getting higher price for lower specified phone

"
"

  This bull ssssshhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiit never buy this crap we can fry an omelette on it .I beg u to try other than Samsung's exenos chips it heats a lotPlease dont waste ur money on itAnd it says heating can cause damaging ur phones this Is samsungBravo Samsung crap

"
"

  MRP of this mobile is ‚Çπ18,000 and i got it at ‚Çπ16,000.Guys its really nice mobile. You will not get earphone with this. Battery is not exactly 6000mh, its 5830mh. But battery backup is really good. You can use it for 1 and 1/2 day.Best mobile for middle class people.

  Just bought Samsung galaxy A21 three months bck. Just 3 months and it‚Äôs already giving problems. Mbl went off and on and now finally it‚Äôs hung and screen is burning hot. What a waste of money . I‚Äôm trying to seek help thru Amazon to fix the problem but not able to avail repair .

"
"

  This is the review after a couple of months of usage. Don't buy if you are camera enthusiast. Camera in low light is not up to the expectation. Touch sensor is not always responsive. Very nice screen and you would love it for sure. Battery life is worthy.

"
"

  Iam writing 1month Experience1.Impressive Display Experience2.Camera not disappointing Good quality output3.Battery from myview 1and half day 16+hrs fully wating videos... But for full charging takes 2.30 hrs4. Operating systems and its relations... giving good output

"
"

  Nice phone ,with good battery life ,I need more from Samsung in camera quality and process working  ,I am not talking about increasing MP's of camera, I am talking about the camera which you fix with the models are not in good as such we get in other brand with same MP's camera

"
"

  Phone is good.But some apps like snapchat and helo were preinstalled which are banned in India. Then whats the difference between Mi and Samsung. And some features like screen recording and data usage and speed are absent..

"
"

  This is a excellent phone in pocket budgets. It's camera, battery and screen and processing speeds are excellent. It is very good compair redmi and realmi mobiles. I was already used redmi note 8 and realme also. I strongly recommended to buy samsung  galaxy m21 mobile.Thank you.

"
"

  said device again in problem audio voice getting mute agaian and againi made bigg mistake by purhcasing in onlien.... replacment or refund time got expired now this phone 21st daykindly suggest what to do with this device mobile phone

"
"

  I thought this phone would pack a more punch for it's price. I mean everything is decent except for the front camera which is just plain terrible.

"
"

  One of the best phone in the market right now...This phone is perfect for who want to buy a decent mid-range from a non-Chinese brand...Rear camera and processor could be slightly better otherwise a good phoneI think best display and battery in this price range.

"
"

  The phone has an excellent battery life. The touch screen sensors and motion sensors are fabulous.the picture quality is good but the night mode picture quality is not upto the mark.Overall the phone gives an excellent performance in low budget phone category.

"
"

  Battery last for 12 after full charge and camera is also good and best part this is made in India ..

"
"

  I think Samsung m21 is the best mobile under 13000 rupees. The built in features are amazing.The display quality is cent percent better than other mobiles . The battery life simply amazing.The cameras are good.To be honest this is the best mobile for purchasers who choose mobile under13000.

"
"

  Really nice and premium look.raven black just clicks.samsung M21 is the best in his range.purely made in india and it has better features than other chinese phone.looks prepium and a photography delight for mobile photographers at this buget.and also its big 6000mah is like gold dust

"
"

  Owsome Mobile in this 14k Price... I like Samsung Mobile phones... Also this one Samsung M21 Mobile is fully loaded with Fornt & Rear Camera, Battery Backup, RAM & Storage Capacity. I love this Mobile hence this phone i have gifted to my Dad and he is Happy so Thanks Amazon & Samsung both....

"
"

  Superb look , super screen, super thin(you must buy screen guard and backcover to protect it), 6000mah monster battery, 48Mp camera, all things are super .(Fingerprints and face lock works slow than expected) but otherwise it is awesome, super.....

"
"

  Damage product received... the handset quality is poor.. new charger having scratches... handset fingerprint area is just above the actual body... not happy with the product want to return it. But amazon is not responding.

"
"

  Excellent display, great camera, excellent battery,Overall a complete package in the segment

"
"

  I bought this product from last 15 days and I saw the issue of cable, I go to the Samsung service center and surprisingly they not take care my request and told me buy a new cable, why I buy again if product is under warranty for 6 months. Don't go for Samsung very poor quality

"
"

  Osm product by Samsung and battery is very good and useful for money as I bought this online 1 week later the rate is gone high 12699 to 13799 nearly 1100 rs

"
"

  This is a fantastic phone. At Rs. 14000 only, I got healthy storage of 4GB and 64GB and the camera and its features- just beauty. Battery life is long as it has 6000MAH monster battery. It takes time for full charge, but after that it will run long. I just loved it and I am recommending this

"
"

  Its fairly decent phone with fairly good battery it's not that good as i thought owing to 6000mah. Camera is good, color balance is ok, speaker give cracked sound sound sometimes but main highlight of this phone is its awesome display if you want best display under 15k then go for this one

"
"

  Speaker not working. software issue so I did not recommend.  Same problem came in replacement phone.

"
"

  I am using Samsung mobile (touch screen) since 2010. First time I feel I purchased the worst mobile in my life.. Bcoz with In a month of time there is a problem with Screen. It is showing half of the screen in Blank and half of the screen image.. I suggest you all don't buy it.. Go with another one..

"
"

  Nice phone..Battery quality good...Fingerprint also good...Display Quality also good...Camera also good

"
"

  Amazing  phone in terms of good  battery  life , brilliant display and mindblowing  camera  performance.  I am using  this phone  around 2 month and very  happy  with  performance of this phone. It is true value for money

"
"

  I got 2 times defective phone. In which I got replacement in the first time due to it occurred in replacement period and the 2nd time the display got jammed after a month. Totally disappointed with the product and Amazon.

"
"

  excellent device for this price range if u are looking for a device with superb display, excellent cameras, and stupendous battery life. No words to explain this beautiful SAmoled display from Samsung. Charging the device takes a bit long time which is a minor con.

"
"

  There is a serious network problem in this phone. Internet speed is too low. Battery is also not what you expect from 6000 mah battery. Using this phone from 2 weeks network is really a problem with this phone. Otherwise in terms of looks, performance and features this phone is outstanding.

"
"

  I have a complaint against this phone which I have bought recently, it' has issues in it's speaker which is stressing me out, also, it comes under warranty!  What am I supposed to do ? How do I get my money back? Or, if not, then how do I get a new properly working phone ASAP?

"
"

  A really good phoneGreat specs overallReally loved the displayBuilt quality is good and gives you a premium feelGood on games tooI previously had a realme phone and i must say its way better than that especially the interface and the build quality

"
"

  Hello everyone ...i written this review using after one month ...Super performanceBest budget mobile...Superb displayBattery charging superb 2 days..Good camera ..Dolby sound really awesomeGaming is also goodI'm satisfied this product.

"
"

  This product having some major issues like, status bar opens and closes automatic, some time lock key/power key not working, network issue network is showing in phone but call is not connecting sometimes.I suggest you people if you don't value your money then you can buy this phone from Amazon.üò†üò†üò†

"
"

  Great phone but given 4 star because of exynos9611 processor. Other companies offer Qualcomm Snapdragon 730 at this price point. Micro stutters are noticeable every now and then. Otherwise Samsung's oneUI is great to experience and work with.

"
"

  A very good buy for the price. I used s6 edge earlier and still loved it. This is no different but with a mega monster battery and faster speed

"
"

  Battery life is decent enough it gives around 5-6 hours screen on time. Camera quality is not that great. Front camera is much better than the rear one. Heavy games are working just fine.

"
"

  Received in nice condition. Perfectly working so far. Battery charge remain for 3-4 days.Camera pixel is very good in both side. Very easy to transfer data from old phone during first time use.Handy and easy to carry. Wi-Fi receiver is good.

"
"

  I am writing review after 5 month this mobile is very very good for camera quality battery  backup also very smooth running all app lovely mobile thanks samsung team

"
"

  This is too good phone value for money nice camera and there is no any issues abiut hanging or lacking and battery life is too awesome and charging is also fast its not take 2-3 hour 0to full charge its only take 1.5 hour this is nice phone thank you Samsung and amzon for providing me easly

"
"

  It is a really good product but the only problem that I faced till now is it's back it gets scratch really easily and the back is also a fingerprint magnet, and also  it heats up a bit while gaming. Till now I don't have any issues with the phone I would highly recommend this phone.

"
"

  A phone loaded with all the latest features, top notch hardware and just at the right price. All this guaranteed by the brand name Samsung!

"
"

  I bought this mobile of  ‚Çπ12700 3 months ago. It is totally value for money.Camera Quality is excellent.Battery lasts 2 days with normal usage.Display. We get Amoled screen at this price which is quite impressive.

"
"

  When u buy this samsung m21 mobile.In Amazon online booking they don't gaveHead phones and travel adapterBut in  phone box the option is given.Head set and travel adapter is there.But online booking only charger was given.They don't gave any other item.

"
"

  The phone is best in this price range . If you are looking for a phone which should  provide you great  display  and massive battery  then its the right choice  for you. I can recommend you it for lite or Mid gaming .

"
"

  This phone heats very much after clicking just 4-5 photos from camera, mostly on the upper side including camera and fingerprint sensor.I think I've got the defected peace. Bad.

"
"

  I bought this mobile 4 months ago and this is going quit hot somethimes within normal use, but i think this is not a major problem. But when i see my camera box is full of dust inside the camera screen, not all the camera specially the lower one which is wide angle shoot camera thats the major problem.

"
"

  Excellent phone with an outstanding battery backup. Camera quality much appreciated in this price range with nice ultra wide angle lens. Fingerprint and face unlock working perfectly . Shows little heatup issues after gaming for a hour of pubg in optimal settings . All over value for money

"
"

  Product is really good ..best part is about its display .it look aawsm and phone is soooo handy..but the front camera is not that much good as aspected from this product ...camera quality of back camera is nice..but it takes much space ..overall i luv this product

"
"

  Excellent phone with massive monsterioud features.......super battery life I am charging this phone in morning and use whole day.......finger print work well done with nice selfie and rear camera in budget...well done Samsung üëçüëç

"
"

  I just love it after using it I can say that it's best value for money  device .best 48 maga pixel  camera ,grate front camera .and 6000mah battery  works for 3 days and super amoled display have grate color and contrast. I recommend  it because  it's best device  with Samsung brand value

"
"

  Super fast charging with an amazing battery life. The camera quality is also quite good and it also has a fast processor. The Fingerprint sensor is quite quick too. The only thing I didn't like is the body of the phone but it is still good.

"
"

  1.Finger print is pretty slow.2.Battery performance is awesome ( it has 6000mah battery once fully charged it can last upto 2 days and more depending on your usage .3.Camera is good in this price range.4.CPU performance is decent.5.It is good phone moderate user.

"
"

  Amazing phone in this price range Camera quality is excellent & Display is very good . Gaming Experience -I played Pubg Battleground In HDR &Fire rate Very high resolution run Smoothly. Due to 6000 battery it charging time around 2.5 hr but overall phone performance is good .

"
"

  I am using Samsung after 5 years and, it has done many improvements in itself. But the type of charger and fast charging didn't work. My battery takes 2.15 hours to get fully charged. The display is good but the processor is slow. Fast charging tag doesn't suit on this model.

"
"

  Taking too much time for charging.

"
"

  Its far superior than all Chinese product. One of the best thing in this mobile is reading mode,its too much optimised,if you watched movie such a long time continuesly never would felt pain in your eyes. And its display quality is ''zahar''

"
"

  Best mobile  under  this price black  color  is looking  superb cameras  performance  is good battery is excellent  and I like super amoled screen .....midrange  or midrange performance

"
"

  It's best budgeted phone . I have bought it for rs 12699 in may 2020. Battery backup is awsm  and camera quality is also great . Only prblm with my M21 is it switch off automatically and switch on after some time automatically it's only prblm. Thankyou Amazon for on-time delivery .

"
"

  Good phone with this price range ,,,,,,,,display quality is best,,,,,,,,battery life is good,,,,,,,, fast charging is good ,,,,,,camera quality is good ,,,,,,,processor is normal ,,,,,,there is no hanging problem with this phone ,,,,,,,samsung is better than any other brand,,,

"
"

  This product is worst without reason this phone showing heating your phone and switched off up to 2 days , we trying to on but phone not responding

"
"

  Totally satisfied, it's a must buy phone....value for money....ticks every box with 5 star rating.....One of the most quality phone in this price range.

"
"

  Battery 1da only

"
"

  the product gave problem right after delivery. The keypad used to be unresponsive sometime. Now the entire touchscreen is unresponsive. Cannot pick up any calls, cannot even unlock the phone. A bad product.

"
"

  There is some heating problem. Except that  overall performance is good and value for money.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my Mom, and this phone is everything a normal man can ask for, it can be used for casual online gaming and daily office purposes and documentation.The fingerprint scanner and facial recognition works absolutely fine, I only charge the phone once a day.

"
"

  This is a very good quality budget phone with good Camera and battery life. Its especially very good for non-gamers.

"
"

  Battery is very good,fingerprint is good,But camera quality is not very good but medium.

"
"

  I have purchased samsung M21 after watching reviews on youtube and after a month the phone is giving awesome performance, battery life is very good, camera and mobile performance is still unbelievable, highly recommended this phone, value for money.....

"
"

  No issue till now. Working as per expectations. Charging time is reasonable. Fingerprint reader fast.

"
"

  This product was worth it...I really loved...thank u Amazon for this amazing product delivery till the door in the situation of crisis...the camera is worth it...the battery life is good the look is lovely the product bought a smile on my face....I would recommend this to be bought....

"
"

  Amazing products by samsung. I am extremely happy with samsung galaxy m21. Amazing ""display quality"",superb ""bettery life"" ,very nice ""camera quality"". I am personally happy with this phone but my suggestions to samsung to improve built quality.all over good product under 13000.

"
"

  Mobile data connectivity is horrible. Either if kerps getting disconnected or provides slow or no speed. Nowadays mobile data is the most important aspect of a cell phone and in this cell phone it's the worst that I have ever experienced in any phone before.

"
"

  Found very good. Though there were adverse comment for battery, it comes for a long time once you charge.

"
"

  I got this mobile before 3 days ........ and I am using from that day my battery status is 20 now ......its real monster .... a gamer can select it for this reason...camera quality its gud ... display is awesome..... I prefer u all personally its  gud to have fun ... it is allrounder....

"
"

  Excellent phone by Samsung at low budget and high features... camera is marvellous and screen resolution is as always beautiful with tremendous battery capacity...!Definitely a must buy phone for everyone...! Samsung proved its leadership again üëçüèª Love you samsung and amazon üíï

"
"

  This is a value for money phone. This phone has awesome camera qality, fingerprint reader and more importanly what a battery life. I charge my phone once in a day only although I use phone a lot. Recommend everyone to buy this phone. Specially if you want to buy a ""Non- Chinese"" phone.

"
"

  Camera is great. Great pictures. Battery drains out fast on standby. Fingerprint sensor works really cool. The battery is of 6000mah so the draining doesn't matter as such still thats the concern regarding this device. Rest all features are great. VALUE FOR MONEY absolutely.

"
"

  I have using Samsung M21 128GB  since June. Is it good to handy and sleek design. Camera performance is good. Battery performance is Best. And I thank SAMSUNG for less SAR value compared to other smartphones. Really this one is Monster in M SeriesM21 - Watta Monster !!

"
"

  Awesome phone in budget.  Exhalent features in this price,  fingerprint reader is very fast,  super 6000 mh battery i got 2day charge in use.  Camera is good not bad,  high quality led display is main advantage in this phone.  I suggests this is the best phone in under 15000

"
"

  Very poor performance.... I don't know when somebody buy from shop there will be issue or not... But from amazon they sell poor production... I have change this mobile.. But then after 1 day the mobile is hanging and touch screen is not working... Poor item sell by amazon...

"
"

  Samsung has known for its quality, this phone has justified this . I bought it last month and trust me it's worth buying for your money. Battery life is awesome , easy to use , processor is good , playing is fine , camera quality is very good . Best phone in this price......

"
"

  Hi, I am using this phone since one month, awesome experience,Samsung could be better with its processor, little lag when sudden rush of WhatsApp messages appear,otherwise phone build and user experience is good. Camera is good,battery life longs upto 1.5 day on full charge.

"
"

  The phone is amazing. Battery is very good and long last for whole day. At the initial usage, I feel some heat but now it's good and feel no heat. Camera's are good. Display is very good to see 4k videos. If you don't want a Chinese made mobile then its a good option to buy.

"
"

  I like Big BATTERY ,48mp camera and the main thing Super Amoled  Display, Dark mode.One of the best feature  is his one UI with no ads.Demerits: when we increase brightness in full phone is getting  warm but it cools down quickly.Network  not stabel  4g switch 2g anytime

"
"

  Review after 20 Day..1. Battery :-Two day battery standby for normal easy2.Display:-Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display3.Design:It has a6000Mah battery, look wise awesome.4. Camera: 3 camera pretty good.

"
"

  iam used m21  after two months today order m31 to my brother.my m21 was superb phoneAbout battery and finger,over all phone specifications.iam using upto may17 samsung j2 pro that time I decided not buy samsung but that time samsung released m21 6000 battery so after used two months iam satisfied

"
"

  Worst phone ever. Even with 6 gb, chrome and keyboard get stuck. Facing issues with internet connection. Connection drops suddenly. Have to switch flight mode at least 20 times a day. This is after using it for around 2 months don't buy it.

"
"

  I am totally satisfied with the performance of Galaxy M21. Very nice and easy to handle, long battery hours, quick in accessing Internets, clarity, Camera quality, storage facilities are extremely good.  Thanks Samsung.

"
"

  After one month charging port stopped I visited service centre they will replace port ic

"
"

  Battery life and finger print reader are very much appreciable as well as camera quality....After taking picture zoom in shows very good clarity......

"
"

  Mic won't work clear HD voice and finger print some times was unable to respond and Flipkart app was totally insane when u bought through Amazon just able to use amazon appI dont know y

"
"

  Worse mobile phone i ever used in my life,i think samsung has also started cheating their customer through indian manufacturing unit and they are producing defected hamdset only.

"
"

  Camera is powerfull enough,S amolead is awesome,6/128 GB cheapest phone right now,battery is not looking as 6000Amh,drain in less then 12 hour,Not a single leg in gamingsuch a wonderful phone

"
"

  It's a good mobile at this range. Good battery backup and camera. I purchased yesterday only. This is my first impression

"
"

  This phone is extremely awesome. Everything's runs super smooth. The gaming toh is also very good without any lagg. It is the best budget smartphone one can ever have. And also it dosen't have any ads like other Chinese smartphones  have. In short it is the best phone for every thing.

"
"

  I was considering for Redmi note 9 pro, but I can't put my privacy at risk & advertisement makes you bored.That's why I opt for Samsung M21. It's secure your privacy, no ads, the best UI & features.The best Smartphone in this price range.

"
"

  Pros: Excellent battery life. Good camera. Good screen.Cons: should have been narrower considered the weight of 6000mah battery. Poor sound, volume is too low. Can't hear anything below 50%.Overall: Decent

"
"

  It is real monster than any other phones. It has a massive battery comes for 3 days with still 20% remaining on normal use. Fingerprint reader is decent. Camera is excellent. Best phone... Gifted for my father. He is really happy

"
"

  AFTER A MONTH REVIEW1.CAMERA QUALITY GOOD2.DIPLAY GOOD3.NO HANGING PROBLEMS4.PROCESSOR SPEED GOOD(I NEVER PLAY GAMES)5.SOUND REALLY GOOD SPEAKER,BUT VOLUME NOT THAT LOUDOVER ALL IT""S SAMSUNGTHE NAME THAT""S ENOUGH

"
"

  Finger print sensor work quick..Battery  live for whole day..Camera capture more detail in day...Camera perform less in low light...First two three day i feel heat near to the rear camera...Delivered good..Good customrr service...Charging wire is very short....

"
"

  No doubt everything in this phone is awesome, camera quality is superb you can see one picture is of front camera when there was no light and camera use screen light as flash awesome. Second picture is from secondary camera, battery 5points, screen 5 points, camera 5points.

"
"

  The phone's media sound is completely off just after one month. Factory reset did not help. Need to bring the phone in samsung service center in such covid and lockdown situation.

"
"

  Awesome product in this price range, what I like most about this product is it has massive battery back along with ultimate camera and display quality.

"
"

  Great phone for the price...16 k budjet competes with phones around the 16 thousands mark big battery SAMOLED screen and camera are good for the price.

"
"

  Using from past 2 months ...battery: gaint battery provide great experience with long lasting... great AMOLED display..NO hanging issues. Really worth in this mid range..In this price range no other mobile can beat this in all over quality...Samsung values their quality

"
"

  Superb phone‚ù§Watta monster.....amazing  battery . I m using  2 days without  charging ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§n also there is no leg in gaming i m not playing  heavy games like pubg....so can't  say about that.......also screen is superb .....Wanna say ......full paisa vasoolüëçüëçüëçüëç

"
"

  Great phone experience. Gallery, Fingerprint Sensor and Phone response are very fast. Thank you for providing awesome features with comparatively low cost.

"
"

  Very good mobile , camera quality is best among all available at this price and even more. Sensitity  of screen is also good  face reader is best seen

"
"

  Extraordinary by Samsung. Battery and camera is very good. Battery is long lasting like if you have heavy usage then you'll definitely get 1 day backup  and with normal usage approx 2.5 days. Realy impressed with display and 48 mega pixel camera thank you Samsung

"
"

  The fingerprint scanner on the phone is pushed inwards from one side and is also pertruding frm the other side I contacted amazon tech support and they're saying that they won't replace it and samsung care is saying to return to Amazon. Now what do I do I'm torn right now

"
"

  Touch Screen not works goodFinger senser not properly worksFace recognition is  bad. Camera Picture quility low battery drains quickly. Screen size smallLot of problems bad mobile from samsung

"
"

  All is good with the phone except that the battery, despite having 6000mah, provides 1 nd half day of bckup...nd the camera is not great as it had to be with 48MP...though the phone has polycarbonate back panel but it still looks great...other than these all is great with the phone...

"
"

  This Samsung Galaxy Note m21 is best device for Samsung lovers in budget segments.Wondering cameraLong last 6000mah batterySuper amoled  display quality is also very niceAnd again  thanks to Amazon  team for providing best service.

"
"

  The best product with amazing camera both front and back and amazing features.Highly recommend this phone

"
"

  Battery are Excellent once you charge battery will be available for 10 hours, As user can use device for10 to 12 hours without charge. finger print reader also good. Camera quality is also excellent. 1 Thing is very interesting in Samsung M21 with android 10 which is it user friendly UI

"
"

  Great phone at this price. Cameras are very good even in liw light. Battery life us too good, last 2 days with moderate use. Sound quality is also good. Screen resolution, excellent.I am very satisfied.

"
"

  Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. Screen quality of in M21 is superb üëç ..Camera shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast and image processing is better but night clicks need improvement.  Monster battery just a monster.

"
"

  Pros:1.awesome display you love it2.battery beyond your imagination (screen on time minimum 11hours)3.camera good4.one UI very nice( specially in dark mode)

"
"

  It's touch is not working after purchase of 20 days only. Also the return window of product is closed. It is disappointing. I have no option other then to visit service centre in such a early period of purchase.I am not satisfied at all with this product

"
"

  Clarity of movies on OTT platform and the battery life is outstanding.

"
"

  Overall very nice phone within this price range. The phone is bit heavy and not very thin as per current trend. Sound is not like Mi or Oppo. Rest everything is good.

"
"

  Product hardware quality is not up to mark.rest all is good. 4GB RAM is not at all sufficient. Samsung itself needs more than 2.5gb. After 4 days,I am facing slow speed while using phone.

"
"

  Though fingerprint sensor could be better but other features are awesome. Most importantly, hats off to Amazon for delivering within 16 hours.

"
"

  I think the price of this phone is more as compared to this performance. And there is more battery discharge at standby mode as compared to other phones.Fingerprint is best.The expected price of this phone by me is 11999.At 13999 you should also check the latest phones.

"
"

  After turning on mobile for first time. Touch screen is not working.  I tried support from Amazon but did not get any support. Amazon SUpport is pathetic they need time to diagnose the fault and later they will decide to replace or not after discussion with product seller.

"
"

  Wonderful mobile and it comes with rear fingerprint sensor and it actual minimum capacity battery 5830mah and camera quality is excellent. It takes 2hrs 15 minutes to full charged and you can use your phone full day.. excellent features and don't get late to buy this phone

"
"

  Heats up in normal use ...  browsing and very quickly while using cameras. I'm not gamer.Battery backup is not bad and it depends.Overall it's good to buy.Using since last 1 month and no problem faced till now.Let's hope for a better future of this.

"
"

  Please don't buy Samsung M21. I am using from past10days. One of the worst phone I have come across. Phone is getting strucked when I am taking calls. I can't hear properly in calls. My friends told not to buy it. Instead of trusting them I trusted Samsung. I realized now.

"
"

  Overall the phone is very good......I liked a lot....but as it is mentioned there that is a monster battery.....!But I don't think that it is...as my battery is draining very fast...and I  also have heating issues...as all the time my phone gets heated even without running anything in the background.

"
"

  Amazing product at this price. Hobbit for my mother who was used to an old Nokia feature phone and  ever since she is hooked onto it. Great camera and battery life. Easy UI and good sound quality. Overall 9 our if 10. Not giving 10  as Samsung could have thrown in a pair of earphones ..

"
"

  Fingerprint is awesome doesn't take too much time to read it is just one touchBattery life so far ever since I am using mobile phones this one has the greatest battery backup kudos to Samsung for such huge batteryCamera quality in the given budget is awesome.....

"
"

  One of the best at the price range. Battery backup is excellent, dispite of having 6000mAh battery phine looks slim, Camera also performs well in day light. Best part of the phone is its display.Low light camera performance could have been better, apart from that, the product is a value for money

"
"

  very very worst this m21 model. video call peasum pothu over heat  aguthu. charge podum pothu heat agutu. mobile use pannu pothu swoff aguthu hang aguthu.  mobile vaki 11th day this prob start. customer care not support. service center poie pathuko nu sollitaga. am very very sad.....

"
"

  Phone having best selfie camera .Battery is also high capacity of 6000mah .Look is also good .Amazon Packaging is very very bad ,most part of phone is visible after packaging.

"
"

  Excellent Build Quality, Fantastic DisplayCamera is simply Awesome, Best PhotographyFabulous Screen, Touch Quality,Light WeightSuperb Sound and Call QualityBest Processor, Great SpeedOverall Awesome phone really HAPPY.

"
"

  Very good product at very affordable price. Camera quality is great. Finger sensor is awesome. Sound quality is great. Nothing to complain.

"
"

  Data Speed is very low.  Not coming 4g Speed.  No network issue.  Even though data Speed is very low.  I checked the item few days later.  No option to return.  Waste of money.

"
"

  Awesome! Amazing phone hella sexy display.Long lasting battery. Lacks some features like app lock. Also there is no internet speed meter in this phone. totally worth for your money. Display quality is superb. Really smooth performance......Your are paying for something amazing here

  Overall it is all in one performer and best in segment of 12k to 18k. Much better than realme or other brands except Nokia. Battery easily lasts 2 days. Camera is above average and acceptable. Screen is super and performance is very good.

"
"

  The camera quality is quite impressive & talking about the battery life it is great for one day use. But if you put the unnecessary apps in sleep mode then it gives some extra battery life. Overall experience is great till now. Let's see what happens after long term use.

"
"

  Problem :Phone is not switching on.It got started for one time and abruptly switched off. Post that its not switching on.Delivery was late (maybe due to lockdown) and return window got closed . How do i return/replace the product ?

"
"

  Bad phone by Samsung. Display damaged in just 2months. Waste of money. Screen is very delicate. Phone fell only once from my hand and display screen broken and now the repair cost is approximate 7k... People think twice before buying this product...

"
"

  Brilliant camera, battery life and display is awesome of feeling in SAMSUNG. Also price batter .Highly Recommended phone üòäüòä

"
"

  Fingerprint could be more better as it deny even if a single drop of water on my hand, and a larger boarder for camera is preferred

"
"

  Best phone for non-gamers.Great Battery life, decent cameras, beautiful screen and faster fingerprint scanner.Pubg gaming experience is not as same as shown in review videos in YouTube. Rendering is too late and lots of desync even when your network is good.

"
"

  Great phone for the price...competes with phones around the Rs.20,000 markThe big 6000MAH battery with SAMOLED screen will make your phone last for 1.5 to 2 days with average use and the 48 MP camera is really good for the price.It's a great phone under this price range.

"
"

  Samsung Galaxy m21.Best phone at this price from Samsung. Good camera and excellent battery backup. fingerprint reader also fine.

"
"

  I am facing issue starting from i received the order.At the time of call your voice not clear to other person.Second not charging soket not working and also not available at service centre.No support no service.Not happy at all from amazon and sumsung.

"
"

  Dnt buy this mobile.. bcz for some rain issue within 1 month motherboard gets damaged, with that I'm using Moto also, but not gets any damage.. this was very bad.. even I asked about repair.. they said no warranty also apply.. very bad within 1 month mobile get damaged...

"
"

  Everything is awesome.fingerprint reader work good.Battery life is 2 days. Because of 6000mAh battery.other big aspect is the camera.But little a bits need to improve it. The quality of the image not more impressive as Samsung A series phone.

"
"

  I am sharing after using this product from last one week Display 10/10Prosesor 7/10Main draw back is its to weighted and its to broad .Suggest  not to buy it .A50 is slim but m21 is to heavy weight due to battry .Overall donr buy this phone .

"
"

  Audio quality is not good I m using starmaker app for singing it's not working properly in starmaker. It has network issues too. Finger print is nice and work well too battery as per given 6000 mah but it work like 3000 mah camera quality is also nice but it auto focus feature is not work properly.

"
"

  Hotspot is not detected by my laptop ...It is a big issue for me...Now I am very disappointed..üòûüòû

"
"

  I am facing network issues. After carried out all troubleshoot methods for network issues, none of them use. Main constrant  is network issues. Think once before buy for heavy users!!

"
"

  Everything is good . Camera is little bit laging initially .battery backup is not upto the level of 6000 mah. Display and camera is very very good . Got it for 12600 rupess in sbi card offer

"
"

  Impressive mobile reasonable price Brand image only camera usage to be adjusted auto call record is not available we are using M30,M31,M21 now

"
"

  Very bad mobile, hanging problems, screen touch is not working properly , I was exchanged with mi 5 pro but I miss my mobile, totally disappointed, in future I will not buy any Samsung mobile. Network problems is also disappointed, app is taken too much  time for open ...

"
"

  Nice one... Fingerprinter is good. Battery life is also good after use one month. First quality camera. Not heating issue. Very fast performance. Hold hand easily. Charging speed also good.

"
"

  Sim card tray had a problem with samsung micro SD card fitting. Micro SD card could be inserted only after scraping card with a blade.Transcend Micro Sd card caused no problem however.

"
"

  Bad phone. Features stop working all of a sudden and then u need to restart the phone. Maybe the vendor thru which this phone is delivered is not trust worthy.

"
"

  Just one word -Awsome.  SUPER AMOLED display is killer. It's unmatched compare to competitor.

"
"

  Totally amazing samsung product...Awesome battery life almost 2 days backupDecent camera setupExcellent displayBack panel is plastic and fingerprint magnet but I use cover always so no worries 20 MP selfie camera is worth itOverall it's no doubt a budget king by Samsung

"
"

  Mobile is good. But Camara quality is not up to the mark. Further, phone is not accompanied with earphone and back cover, which is disappointing. Rest is good. Above all, I feel proud to order and get this because this is from a company which is not from China and the phone is manufactured in INDIA.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very poor as compare to other phone in a range of 16k. Battery is also draining like 3500mah. And it's comes with fast charging but actual charging time for 0-100 % is about 4hrs.. Camera pics in daylight is very good but in night mode pics quality is very poor.

"
"

  Display not working smoothNavigation buttons not workingscreen display is laggingsamsung service is very very poorthey fight with customer instead of solving their problemsservice center does the mistake and they blame the customersdont purchase samsung phones

"
"

  I love this one, and this is best in class, no.1 best budget mobile and Samsung mobile brand also global no.1 brand in the world. Singer print reader nice working..Battery life awesome.. camera quality good...Great one, my rating is 4.5 star, thanks to Samsung and Amazon.

"
"

  Very good Screen, smooth fingerprint Unlock, Light weight, premium looking2 days of battery backup easily for moderate user(not gamers). If you are not a heavy gamer then you can go for this any day instead of chinese phones in the market.Camera is good but doesn't really feel like 48 MP.

"
"

  I writing this after use of 7 days. Its a fabulous  mobile. I like itGood CameraBattery  lyf suberbDisplay is stupendousI dont feel any heating issue during play pubgSelfie is goodLight weight if we consider 6000mah.

"
"

  When I open my box . I didn't get my lead and charger,, this is rediculas,, n i try to call customer care but don't able to chat.. but seriously it happened first time,, my all experience with Amazon is good but now i purchase costly item n dissatisfied.. please replace it..

"
"

  Excellent product , good fingerprint sensor , very light phone and excellent display and sound . And best performance in the mid range phone Recomended for daily use .And more importantly the Samsung UI 2.0 which improved the user experience .MUST BUY PHONE .

"
"

  Product is very bad, after using it for 20 days, I found its wastage of money, so many problems like heating issues, network connectivity and process delay, and while contacting to customer care there reply is not satisfying , so from my side this is very bad

"
"

  BEST MIDRANGE PHONE WITH SUPER PERFORMANCEVERY WORTH IN THIS PRICE CATAGORYTHANKS TO AMAZON

"
"

  Battery is not up to mark. It takes long to charge but  not serve purpose for long time

"
"

  Excellent phone....brilliant camera...camera would be better,idf micro sensor was there...still very impressive imade quality.On front of UI ,lot need to be done as ,rival MI UI 12 offers much more rich user experience.

"
"

  *battery life* can be better*heating Issues* are present...Network connectivity is normalDisplay is Nice amolled glass is best.Touch works wells.Music is ok.Headset can be provided

"
"

  Best phone with good processor , camera quality is ok, and battery life is good till 1.5 days, but little bit heats during charge.

"
"

  Very disappointed with Samsung M21 ; poor camera Quality such as image taken by Samsung old phone having 5MP camera was far better than this 48MP camera Quality.Overall bad choice and bekar phone, overrated in reviews!!!.

"
"

  Camera quality is good also reads finger sensor appropriately.Best product in such a low price.

"
"

  Just too good to be true at this price range. Camera is of superior quality and the phone does have a premium in-hand feel.Just simply love it.Battery backup is around 24hours with heavy gaming and internet usage along with bluetooth media playing.

"
"

  The best mobile with excellent fingerprint and camera quality. The name Wat a monster is perfect for this mobile as it has long life battery.

"
"

  One of the best smartphone Phone. This device like a champ in range of budget phone. Battery backup is fabulous. Amoled display and strong build quality make device premium.

"
"

  After seeing the review I purchased this phone. I have been using samsung for the last 7 years. It is worth buying. good quality camera.

"
"

  Ordered a week ago only, first look and performance looks good. Camera is almost as good as my previous phone Samsung a7 which i purchased for approx 22k. This one has more value for money.

"
"

  Brilliant phone under this prize range and that of like a brand of SAMSUNG (also having a made in india tag), superb battery backup, nice camera quality, unmatchable features under this prize range #s-amoled display #camera quality #battery backup

"
"

  Very good phone in this range. I wrote this review after 15 days used. All features r very good. Sound is very good. Battery life also best. No heating. I saw many comments about hitting but no any issue of heating. I Recommend this phone most buy

"
"

  Overall good mobile with big battery and good camera.Pros-big battery, natural cameraCoins-There are nothing at a name of inbuilt lock.you will be frustrat if u want to hide or lock apps,social media apps etc.Knox security not available.

"
"

  There is a lot to say about samsung mobile.1st. Worst ram management.2nd. Hangs every now and then.3rd.frame drops in UI.4th. Disgusting UI.5th it lags lags n just lags.6th i wasted money and going to throw this device on olx.

"
"

  It heats too quickly when recording video . Takes too long to charge fully approx 3.5 hrs.  Camera doesn't  perform well in low light.Else everything is perfectly fine. A good choice for non gamers. Samsung should launch SD processors in low budget phones.

"
"

  Great battery lifeGreat displayAverage DolbyAverage fingerprint scannerGood cameraSome reception problem...but manageable...no problemOverall just go for it.....

"
"

  TThe price with the brand value are awesome.. Amazing products with wonderful features. powerful battery life.Camera quality is amazing. figure print reader is working quite good. Recommend. One thing that if the body cabinet could be metallic then it could be the best one.

"
"

  camera quality = 08/10Bettery life = 10/10Display = 09/10Fingerprint = 07/10Not a Chinese company

"
"

  USING LAST 7 DAYS ,VERY GOOD MOBILE TWO DAYS BACKUP IN NORMAL USAGE, NO LAG OR HEATING LIGHTWEIGHT THAN POCO XIAOMI ETC SUPER AMOLED CRISP DISPLAY. CAMERA AS PER PRICE SEGMENT.PROCESSOR IS SUPER FAST.

"
"

  Excellent product !! Really the best mobile under 15k. Camera quality is amazing. Fingerprint reader is also fast. And the battery capacity is huge it lasts  a full day even for a heavy user. I recommend to buy this phone rather than going for some Chinese brands like redmi or realme.

"
"

  One of the best M series products from Samsung. User interface is awesome, good battery life, good camera quality, perhaps sound quality could have been improved but with atmos dolby that comes inbuilt is gives good quality with ear piece and absolutely highly recommended!

"
"

  I bought 2 phones and both of them are faulty pieces. First mobile's touch screen stopped working exactly after one month.Second mobiles display has gone. Don't get cheated in the name of brand.

"
"

  Please don't but in amazon, they are cheating and 2nd quality they are sending to all. This phone have heating issue and they won't replace for heating. Now my phone stopped working because of heating issue

"
"

  Really very good mobile phone. Camara, battery very good. Overall this phone is a punch of power-steady-smooth-fluidic fast.Love it.

"
"

  I never expected that I'll get these kind of performance, features, styling at this price tag. I'm extremely satisfied with the performance of all new Samsung Galaxy M21 (64 gb) Raven black. I'm loving it üòç ‚ù§Good job Samsung this time.üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

"
"

  phone heats even on basic function like calling and charging. Phone stays hot with 40 degree temp.I dont recommend this phone at all.Return policy is f**up. You have live with this failure.DONT BUY..

"
"

  I am unsatify to samsung by using this mobile..camera is not good as well as alot of problem in mobile network.This phone have a problem of network is we are using two sim. If we use one sim only then its works properly. So i am unsatify by purchasing this mobile.

"
"

  This is my first Samsung phone and I heard a lot about this phone through my friends. It's been 1 week I am using this phone and I have fallen in love with it. It doesn't hang and I don't face any difficulty while working upon this. Genuinely great phone samsungüòäüòäüëçüëç

"
"

  The phone Samsung Galaxy m21 is just great upto the expectations. The battery life is stable as good as Corona is stable ü§£. The fingerprint sensor senses at a very good speed. As expected camera quality is so real. So galaxy m21 would be the best at this budget üôåüèª‚ù§üåü

"
"

  Yesterday i was  Received My Samsung Galaxy M21. Before Delivery Date. It's a Surprise for my Dad. After Received Mobile My Dad So Happy. Because Mobile is Wonderful in Low Budget range. Thanks Samsung Wonderful Mobile  & Amazon for Fastes Delivery.

"
"

  I was Asus m1 pro user and m1 have good signal of ‡§è‡§Ø‡§∞‡§ü‡•á‡§≤ as well as downloading speed. Moving my sim to this phone and now i am getting only 1 signal and slow internet speed. These are the problem with this device. I see some reviewer also claiming it's have low internet speed.

"
"

  Please dont buy. Just only 3 months. Its hanging continuously. I paid 14000 for this garbage. Hanging when speaking, browsing. I felt i lost my hard earned money. Even lava which I buy for 6000 is good for more than 2 years

"
"

  Sound system of this phone is problem fromthe day1.after 30 days sound sytem completly not functional.

"
"

  Super mobile üì±phone wonderfuly made I liked it very much 6GB ram 128 GB internal.Compare to redmi note 9 pro and realme x2Samsung m21 is much better . I love this device display ,battery super, amazing mobile phone under this price range .

"
"

  Phone is just awesome. In this price great features provided by Samsung. Camera quality is superb and phone battery life is too good.

"
"

  Excellent phone.  Very good value for money.  Camera is too good.  Samsung phones are very reliable (Dont hang or crash).  Battery is amazing.  Amoled display is very bright and crisp.  Could not have imagined a better phone in this price.

"
"

  Worst phone i purchased in my life is SAMSUNG M21. i had purchased it 20 days ago, proximity sensor is not working properly. sometimes screen goes black. i have to visit service center in 20 days of purchase. worst experience of my life. i dont recommend SAMSUNG M21 to anyone else.

"
"

  Descent product from the brand with all required features for normal regular usage. It is not for heavy gamers. It is the best in the market from Samsung under 14000rs. Better use back cover and tempered glass. Same product is available in Flipkart for around 16000rs.

"
"

  Product is very slow in responding. Like while trying to open browser it takes lot time.  While trying to call it opens very late. Not satisfied. Applications will not work properly.  Bad phone . Not worth of money.

"
"

  This Phone is actually good.UI is rich of features.Camera is excellent for 12699rs Smart phone.Wide angle camera is perfect.Display experience is wonderful.Cons:Fingerprints and Face detection is hit and miss. Doesn't work efficiently always.

"
"

  Battery doesn't seems 6000 Ampdrawn too soon 1 & 1/2 day only even without playing games & without watching videos .Intermittent hang issue... worth while product must not be working like this.. if paid 17 k then it should be performe like that

"
"

  Poor performance. Doesnt capture proper network both for calls and mobile data usage..my 4year old phone work better than this. camera quality is just okay. Alarm doesnt work sometimes.really disappointed and surprised that amazon showin this as their choice.

"
"

  Samsung is never make a good phone I mean it has 6000mah battery but it gives backup like 3000mah I have to charge my m21 3 times a day wrost smartphone battery ever seen don't  go for Samsung  Redmi is better....... Samsung please improve battery life in m21I make mistake to buy phone

"
"

  This is one of the best phone.If you want all rounder mobile with best display and best battery under 14k .Go for it no doubt about it.

"
"

  Excellent battery life, love the blue light filter. Works on dual 4g sim. Love the image quality.

"
"

  Worst service goes to Samsung.Samsung customer care person do not know how to talk with customersThey do bad behaviour with me and other customers.They show rudeness.So late serviceMay be you have to submit your phone for 1 week for simple part repair

"
"

  Not high just medium product that's all.not really charging and battery drains like 3500 mah.amoled display is good but no hdr.freefire no lags at high graphics and movies are in good color and lot much mindflaying when I shifted from other LCD displayed mobiles and laptops to this.

"
"

  Fantastic phone. I like samsung because of its display. Its wow. Previously i was using samsung j7 from 2016. Now i switched to M21. Its awesome. Battery life extra ordinary.  For normal use its best phone. For gaming not recommending this phone. But remaining  all  specs superb.

"
"

  Didn't turn our expectations down.. Decent Camera.. Huge Battery backup.. can go without charging for 1 day with heavy usage.. Amazing Display... And Much More.. Go for it..

"
"

  Worth buying

"
"

  Great phone !!Superb screen. Fingerprint reader is pretty fast.Great battery life. But camera quality is good for price. Its only slightly better than my lenovo K8 Plus.  Works really smooth.Samsung is more reliable than the competitors in this price segment.

"
"

  Packaging of the product is not so good....and this has been experienced by me many times. Product is working up to the mark but when you see this kind of packaging you will definitely think whether the product is used or unused.Hope amazon will look at the same.

"
"

  after calling the other person cant hear your voice at all,Unable to communicate through common callsVery bad productNet connectivity also not good, the same simcard will work fine in other phone but not in M21Getting too much heated

"
"

  Using M20 from last year working fine, but M21 touch stopped working within two months. Even not able to draw lock pattern after restarting.

"
"

  I like video shooting in slow motion,when saw this, I was excited.and good battery backupand finger print working so goodI dislike when I captured pics at night time front cam was not too good ,.....apart from this I love this item.Thank you ....üôÇ

"
"

  Worst mobile don't buy because not even worth of 6000 Mobiles are good enough with speed and features in this camera not good features are waste settings are waste all are waste don't even think to buy this mobile because I am sharing after two months usage

"
"

  Every thing is ok but charging speed very slow sumsung mobile better then chiana monile camera ,bantry asowme ,super anmould display very nice

"
"

  Although I had liked the product but there is some problem that I started facing from yesterday that is at the left side of my device screen there is a line showing up amd it seems like permanent nad its growing with time means it is spreading towards its right side.

"
"

  What Battery Monster...Must buy product under 13K ..Display is really awesome in dis Device,  And even though 6000 MaH battery it's feel so light.Kudos to Samsung Design team. They did a great job.Overall Must buy mobile with full of Sepcs

"
"

  If you need phone for security purpose then go for it .It is not a Chinese brand phoneI got it in ‚Çπ 15,999I have 6 / 128 gb varient

"
"

  Good battery backup and display.Front camera is average. Processor is average.

"
"

  Camera is ok. According to 48 mp, it is not up to the mark. For camera, go for other phones.Battery is good but not justifying 6000 MAH.Display quality and design are impressive.The size is handy.

"
"

  Hey , you the one reading thisYou may find a lot of reviews on any xyz social platforms , so how about you yourself buy it and test it...that's my idealogy for any thing ...PS: no 2 people in this world will have same thoughts and same situation and same point of view.

"
"

  Galaxy M21 is the best value-for-money buy. Deducting one star for the heating problem while charging, but that is insignificant. Amazing camera. Fluent to use UI. No lags.

"
"

  Camera  quality  of the phone was  excellant for mid range phone . Battery life are so good that we can't  explain . Fingerprint were fast and good but it be improved. Also it has  very easy to use UI . Overall  it is a Budget friendly phone that all can buy.

"
"

  Below average speed. Sometimes 1st photo doesn't save. Not value for money. Costly as compared to other brands. Stereotype look.

"
"

  Battery AwesomeDisplay awesomeNight mode camera not goodstock camera app not goodIPx rating is not availableall other things are normal

"
"

  Just go for it.It is a best fit product in middle class range with all features to explore

"
"

  Nice , fast speed nice for playing game , and display is amazing while watching he movies.

"
"

  It is working like 3g mobile.....video call is not connecting....highly waste mobile

"
"

  I have used this phone for about 21 days.This is the best phone which you will get at this proce range.Excellent build quality , Battery , Display , Sound system , Performance.You will get everything top of the quality by Samsung.

"
"

  I pretty surprised with the performance, it‚Äôs hardly behaves like a phone with 6 GB RAM. Opening multiple apps makes it hanged frequently, games like DLS20 or Rise of Nations which doesn‚Äôt require heavy memory usage is also very slow. Camera is also average.

"
"

  Worst phone ever seen Samsung sent me email that I can Win Lavel U if I review about my phone But I will not recommend this phone because camra is very bad picture not coming clear . IF u opt night mode then flash option not available

"
"

  The phone offers poor internet speed. Internet browsing speed often slows down to the extent that google search pages fail to load. Asked for replacement, however, the mobile inspection person never visited. What a waste of resources!

"
"

  Camera quality is good but need improvementBatery is also good but doesn't support reverse chargingDisplay screen is awesomeProcessor is also good but not so

"
"

  Don't buy from Amazon very bad delivery, the mobile was Damaged near fingerprint sensor.Battery is 6000mh but working like 4000mh, it's giving only 1day battery backup ...

"
"

  Network issue are there  Camera quality is not up to the markVery less options of. Editting photos Look is good Weight of the phone  is light Battery. Last only for one day  if used  rarelyFor watching videos .

"
"

  In 5 days of use‚Ä¢BATTERY - battery backup of this  mobile is very good.‚Ä¢CAMERA  - camera quality is pretty  good and satisfying,  especially the 48mp wide  angle shot.Summing up this a great device, go for it.....

"
"

  Using from last 1 weakSuper mobileNever expected from SamsungPaisa vasoolBattery may not be 6000mah..I think it's 5000mahCharging also goodSuperamoled display was awesome video brightness better than m30sBack glassy finish feels like glass

"
"

  Very nice phone  in this budget. Camera quality is not that much good that a 48mp camera captures but satisfying front camera ..From my opinion it's the best phone what you can get in this budget..Fingerprint and face unlock works well.Processor is also Fab...

"
"

  Please find below which I experience with Samsung Galaxy m21.1. Overall fantastic phone in terms of battery life and performance and Camara also around the budget of 15k .2. This is my third Samsung galaxy phone I am very happy to use it.

"
"

  Like is nothing as nothing great at this price. Software is problematic and the internet speed is not supported well.

"
"

  I bought m21 last week but I'm really disappointed because of it's camera bug problem.Sometimes when I tried to capture photos it shows a black screen and then I'm getting the same black screen image. even after force stopping the camera,clearing,restarting the mobile

"
"

  It would be fantastic If output audio is a little louder...and it's getting a little heat while using video calling..

"
"

  Very Nice For Value for money But need forth camera for macro pic. Hope better more producet like this satisfy more customers i m sarisfy.  Thank you Samsung &  AMAZON FAST DELIVERY.

"
"

  This mobile is very good and smooth to use.i m using from last 15days and it is working very well, battery life is so good, fingerprint reader is working properly and if i talk about camera quality that is incredible.Thanks to Amazon for delivering this product in pandemic & critical situation..

"
"

  One of best phone on these segment when it's comes to brand value it's comes on second place.these phone more valuable and reasonable price.camera quality also awesome and display is one of most advantage on these phone it's very clear look amazing response also very well

"
"

  Overall it's a awesome budget phone with good battery backup and it's very light weight having 6000mah battery.rear camera performance is good.display is fabulous with good sound quality.

"
"

  Mobile has heating issues... Without using any high performance apps or even without using youtube or songs just simpl use causes the mobile to heat specifically on upper side...also it's not that much smooth in over all performance

"
"

  Battery life is awesome if use full it still full day. Camera quality is good and image colour also good. Fingerprint and face reader also good working. UI of samsung was awesome. Charging  speed is bit slow but may be because of 6000Mah battery.

"
"

  Great Phone...in Midrange MobilesI am using M21 phone  from 2 months....no lagging..no issuesMay not i noticed....Battery gives excellent.. lifeCamera also... decent captures..Exynos 9611 better processor than  Another Midrange mobiles

"
"

  Ordered this phone on Primeday sale, let's be frank this is the best budget phone from Samsung.,  super battery life, amazing display, nice look, everything perfect.Loved this mobile.

"
"

  Phone start heating up while callCamera clearity not so clear, camera pixels is just numberBatary backup not so long, and it takes too much time to charge aroung 4 hrs

"
"

  I have purchased this a week back and can say that it has been more than my expectation. Earlier I have used sony xperia and Redmi note4 but this one has been the best out of them. Recommend to go for it if you are looking for a middle segment smart phone.

"
"

  One of the bestest phone under ‚Çπ15000.Wide angle camera is superb.Battery is just amazing.Fingerprint is just blazing fast.Samsung is doing a phenomenal job with its M series.Loved the product.

"
"

  The phone has great battery life, SAMOLED display and a decent processor. For a mobile phone at this price, it offers great features. Although it has a 18V fast charge, I think that could be improved given the huge battery.

"
"

  Phone is not as good as I expected...photos quality were not good and despite of having 6000mah battery it downs quickly and charger is also not fast and it also heats while charging...this phone have many problems but display is good

"
"

  Excellent battery life, under normal usage and gaming comes upto 20 hrs , without gaming stands for more than a day.Good quality pictures from front and back camera .very satisfied with the product.

"
"

  Best phone for day to day usage and for media consumption, wouldn't get any better at this price. And, the battery backup is the best thing in this phone , I am getting full 2 days battery backup with this.

"
"

  Nice product by Samsung in this price rangeLittle bit bulky and heavy but considering battery 6000mAh it's acceptableOnly drawback is wifi calling is not working in it may be some software issue

"
"

  All fine except camera. I dont understand why photos are showing black when I see in the gallery. This is not happening all the time but its very frequent. Camera quality also not good .

"
"

  This is my 3rd phone received under replacement and this is also defective piece.  Sensors stopped working after 10 days.  Samsung phones are ridiculous as I got issues in 3rd replaced phone.  Can't replace again and have to get it repaired just within 12 days.  Don't buy at all...

"
"

  I have bought it for my wife two months ago and she is very happy to use it. Camera quality upto the mark and other features included by samsung are easy to understand... I will suggest to buy under 15k with 6gb ram and 128 gb rom. Go for it...

"
"

  Owsome....mobile anyone can purchase value for money... but when I purchased all are new but charging 0 to 100 battery takes more than 5 houres I think bugs fix important to samsung for new update for samsung m21 immidieatly...and finally I have replaced for new device....

"
"

  Beast. üéâüéâ Best mobile in this price 15k. 6g RAM and 128 GB is surprise.  Long life battery. Camera quality could be better. Slightly disappointed. But price is matter. Handling smoothly. All is good for normal gamers and our day to day tasks. Try it without thinking twice.

"
"

  Although i bought 6gb 128 gb fone, it hangs sometimes while typing. I didnot expect such performance from this phone as my husband using samsung A8 and he literally nvr had any issue. Am not a gamer still whats use of 6gb ram if it cnt run few apps without hanging?

"
"

  1.Fingerprint reader is fast enough 2.battery life is awsome you can get battery life more than a day3.camera quality is super4.it supports pubg upto smooth and extreme but it gets more frame drops5.best pubg graphics for this phone is smooth and high you can play

"
"

  Within two months screen turned back and purple and services center not helping mi

  Amazing battery. Will last for more than 24 hrs. Next level display, Great features and camera quality.  Highly recommended phone.Thank you Amazon and Samsung.

"
"

  I am totally disappointed form this mobile.Front camera quality is very poor, all images are getting blur, am not able to scan any QR code and face lock also not working. I visit service cernte  but not get any support from samsung team.  Then i think samsun  cheated with me.

"
"

  Very good and premium features in this price range. performance is amazing and battery life is quite good.Smoothly working for normal and daily usage. Not recommended for heavy gaming users like pubg.

"
"

  Pros:+Very good super amoled display+Very good UI+Not china makeCons-Avarage quality camera-Phone speaker output not adequate

"
"

  Sumsang Galaxy M21 6GB RAM 128GB Internal Memory 6000mah Battery fast charging very nice mobile in budget  Price Rs14450/= Only and available EMI Option also with banks

"
"

  Camera is better than redmi 9pro,sensitivity of finger sensor is to good it's like a rear biometric sensor,,battery backup also to good

"
"

  Ratings after 20 days of use:Display - As usual, being a samsung phone amoled display is superb at this price segmentBig Battery and fast charging - Very GoodCamera - DecentSound - GoodFingerprint Reader - Very fastOverall - 4.3/5

"
"

  Battery lyf I dont so good. But battery is getting  drained very fast. Example - if I charge the battery full today morning at 09:30 then by tomorrow  morning I will get on 20% of battery lyf.As per the battery which is provided should work for atleast 2 days.

"
"

  Better camera, good battery, best for simple daily use and also multitasking. Not recommend for gaming.

"
"

  Amazing phone . Baterry life is  good angdcamera is quality is superbSo I gave this phone 5 star ratingThis phone seems to be attactive and good looking. Really lovly phone.

"
"

  Great battery, vibrant screen, smooth operation, made in India and value for money

"
"

  Dislikes:1) Screen shot feature is not at all available2) SMS: Recent call contact attachment is not possibleIf someone who needs / uses the above features in regular life, It is big disappointment like me.Likes:1) Battery2) Camera

"
"

  ¬†It's very slim and the one ui is very smooth with the monster battery and Super amoled display.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is absolutely secure..camera is capable for both long and short shot with remarkable clarity..its wide function performs well..I could never seen such battery with long life.. we can definitly trust in the life of its battery...

"
"

  I am using M21 and I am quite happy till now.Pros: Good looking, Fast, good battery life, back camera is very good. Wide angle camera also good. Faceunlock and biometric unlock is smooth.Cons: front camera is very bad at ni8. Its take too much Time to change full.

"
"

  I can't believe Samsung could pack this much features in M21.M21 doesn't feel like mid range device if you look at features.Hands on experience is smooth, screen is premium battery life is outstanding.I will recommend it to every Indian.

"
"

  Camera quality poor and battery draining fastlyFingerprint reader very slow and features is less processor is slow

"
"

  Battery life is so much poor. In normal use I have charging twice daily. When use internet the battery is draining the end position at 2 hours. It seems the battery is like 3500mah .So, I requesting the company to check it and give proper 6000 mah battery farther.

"
"

  The camera quality is amazing.... it has so many amazing filters ..... they make the picture flawless.... The battery life is very long .... it doesn't get exhausted if I charge it full once in the morning .... it works throughout the day....I loved it totally ‚ô•Ô∏è..

"
"

  I bought this product and for 3 months everything smooth.No lag was experienced.If you want this for gaming only and you dont want to use chineese phones you can go for this and if you want advanced performance you can install advanced plugins.Thank you

"
"

  When I play downloaded songs from sd card or internal storage it's take to much time to play seems like delay on play and delay on changing songs my my is around 3 weeks old and I suffer this issue from last 3days my phone and apps are updated  don't buy this model

"
"

  Product is very nice.6000 mah battery is not reliableVery weak condition.and the charger quality is very low.my charger is not working in only a 5 months usage.dont buy guys .And one more thing .Some times the device does not respond touches and lock screen .

"
"

  One of the best battery life at this price. Camera is not up to the mark. So cam avg quality. Great display. Though would've liked a snapdragon processor.

"
"

  Very bad heating problem more heat during call.we have received the phone on 20 may 2020.

"
"

  Good Samsung product with Mid range.Display - 8/10Finger Sen - 9/10Battery - 9/10Camera - 7/10Performance - 8/10Overall - 8/10

"
"

  As you touch the fingerprint reader you phone gets unlocked, High speed fingerprint unlock.Battery life off course best as 6000 mah is provided.Camera quality is also best in this price and after software update single take is also provided.

"
"

  There was no plastic wrap on the box. That means the product was already unboxed. Still decided to take a chance with the product as I needed a device badly. So far no problem. Disappointed with the seller. I would have returned the product if had time.

"
"

  if you are looking for samsung smartphone under 15000 then samsung galaxy M21 is best .it is non chinees,with great performance ,battery,camera.it runs on one UI which is awesome and include great features.it has super amoled display .

"
"

  Samsung m21 is awesome phone. Camera quality is awesome you can see the camera quality in attached photo .Battery performance is also mind blowing my phone battery life is approx 2days.Overall in this rate the samsung M21 is awesome.Value of money

"
"

  I'm satisfied. although chinese firm are giving more features for money but still i will like to give my money to non chinese company.

"
"

  I had very bad experience with the M21. Within 2 months of buying the mobile it starts complaints.I went to service center they told me it's hardware complaint. And never replaced. It's not a good thing a phone get hardware problem only 2 month's.

"
"

  Best phone in midrange and it's really a monster mobile .Samsung is my trusted mobile brand .Every year Samsung try so much in their mobile .And SAMSUNG is a big trusted brand .And Samsung made mobile for Indian people

"
"

  I have been using this phone since almost 2 months now. I am very much satisfied with the performance. It is value of money. Processor performed good. Worth to mention the quality of camera, am really impressed how samsung has came back successfully in the middle range phone

"
"

  This phone all the features are really good, but the front camera having some issues with auto adjusting skin tone direction, whenever i click a snap it's comes with a yellow tone ! Don't know why ? If Samsung fix this issue with a update or a solution I'll be thankful to them.

"
"

  Network signal üì∂ is too poor as compare with other phones.. Other wise it's a üëçgood smart phone

"
"

  I reviewed this product after usage of 3 months.Very very nice product at this range....Best battery backup..Dolby sound...Best camera..very smooth touch screen...Very very nice product.

"
"

  Samsung mobiles are waste of money nowadays. The phone is not charging after a month of usage and when googled it seeems this is a major problem with samsung phones.Just frustrated to see new phone is not charging.

"
"

  I purchased this product from amazon and delivered it on time, but when i unboxed i noticed that the box was dusty but the phone was brand new but the charger was seems like used with  scratches. But i am satisfied with the overall performance.

"
"

  Nice go for it...i used approximately 8 days and i fell its complete  phone for who spend time with most of mobile because  battery life is so amazing...

"
"

  I bought this Samsung M21 mobile before two months. This is very good mobile in this range. It has very good camera and sound quality. There is no hanging problem in this mobile and it has very good Display. Full marks to Samsung m21 mobile.

"
"

  I like camera quality both in case of images and video. I think this device is good for vloging(for beginners). Another thing is its battery, you can use it longer as u want.There is no dislike qualities in my mind.One device cannot give every quality.

"
"

  Pros: Screen, Battery, Camera, Clean UI, Processor is decent, Screen is big but still you can use it with one hand.Cons: Doesn't have any pre installed ""App Lock"" application, Doesn't have inbuilt feature for showing internet speed, Doesn't have Samsung Pay.

"
"

  Battery backup is bit average (definitely not a monster) other aspects are really good.

"
"

  Great phone for the price. There were few times when the keyboard hangs, while using WhatsApp and while changing keyboards. This was resolved with a restart. Apart from these, no issues so far

"
"

  If you are that kind of person whose day begins,moves on and end with a mobile,yes my friend this is the best one with the least cost...Display and battery are indeed of monster quality..Nothing had went wrong so far..Truly recommended

"
"

  Battry life -goodCamera quality -goodDisplay colors and touch -goodUser Interface -goodFeatures -goodSeparate audio device for different app is an excellent feature...Overall great experience...

"
"

  Awesome phone within this price range. Really liked the camera quality and AMOLED screen is the best.Only lack is this doesn't come with screen guard or cover and it's not easy to find those in the market.Overall a great phone from Samsung.

"
"

  Good Battery backup, AMOLED display looks great!!!. Lots of option in camera for super slow, slow motion and in selfie we can raise the PALM to take auto selfie.... this feature makes easy to take selfie instead of auto timer / clicking... Cool feature

"
"

  Superb!!I am afraid  while I am booking this first time I booked phone  online but it was really amazing trust me. Same as shown in pic , Really GOOD

"
"

  Go for it..nice trendy phone. Great battery back up with fast charging and good camera quality. Better than any other chinese phone.

"
"

  Very nice product in this range but network connectivity is low.and heating issues  also find out during changing.

"
"

  The battery life is very good of this phone but only one drawback I feel is its charging speedIt Almost take 2.45 to 3 hours for full charging.The display is great in this price range and the rear camera quality is excellent.. the front camera is not that great but its ok.

"
"

  Many many problems in the Samsung galaxy m21 Mobile and I'm very disappointed...Amazon replacement or return service is very bad.... I'm unhappy with this seriously guys please don't buy by amazon

"
"

  Worst phone I used in my life time, heating problem and hang became common in  daily use....I purchased mobile on 25-07-2020 after seven days of time  phone getting hang and full heat....heating issue is really very worst thing......please don't buy the phone....

"
"

  i Brought this for my Sister and she is really really happy .she loved this .....go for it if you are searching for Mid range phones .. this is superb compare to Chinese products

"
"

  I purchased this after increase in GST for 13,999.Best phone in every aspect except for poor built quality. There's flex in back around fingerprint sensor.

"
"

  Screen,Battery,Camera, OS  everything is very good. Plastic body 'may' feel cheaper to metal finish fans. There is no cover and earphones in the box but at this price the phone is best in its class. Took me 2.5 hours for 0-100% charging (approx). The delivery was fine, no problems at all.

"
"

  Guys, this is a on of the greatest product.Pahle baat karonn iss ki battery ka..to yo hai mind blowing....battery is awesome.Next main baat karoon iss ki camera ka to just great..!!!All of these ..this phn is completely fantastic.I suggests people to buy this phone..

"
"

  Product is nice , the battery and camera works really well, been using it for 2 months and I only need to charge it once and battery lasts whole day. Recommended

"
"

  first i know this is a bad phone , but  it involved  better performance and extend battery life.i am suggestion for you,these is best choice to under 15000 budget smart phones

"
"

  Everything is great about this product except the volume key. If you press the key once for increasing or decreasing the volume then it increases or decreases by two. So the music is almost never on my preferred volume.

"
"

  A nice product to buy in this price segment. I m writing this review after using it for 10 days. It's a good choice to buy as it fulfill most of your expectations as all the features are very good in this price range. I would suggest to go for it.

"
"

  Fast charging & camera focus of this phone is pathetic. Moreover, sometimes it take time to switch to apps. Processor is quite slow. I only liked the price, screen size n hd quality display in this phone. Nothing much worth to buy actually.

"
"

  For video call purpose it is a very poor phone. Even battery does not lasts for a day at very low use. Adaptive brightness is not so effective does not work properly. Fingerprint sensor is also very slow. Apart from this everything is good.

"
"

  Good mobile from samsung in this range..I bought it 12699 rs..and i thnk this is the best phone in this price

"
"

  Battery is draining fastAnd it is not fast chargingMy gorilla glass damaged

"
"

  The display is best in the midrange category,I am using the phone since one month i feel the phone is good .the one disadvantage is 15w charger it takes about three hours to charge i hope they would have given 25w charger.

"
"

  1st time received defective piece and requested for replacement again 2nd time also received defective piece . Then requested for Refund but not received refund . 15 days over there no response from Amazon . Very disappointed with samsung and Amazon .

"
"

  after using 1 month i wrte this review , this samsung midrange phone is such a mildstone for those who use this phone only for running of applications not for games for normal purpose of work you can go for this phone.üëçüëç 'your's true feedbacker'üòÄüòÄ

"
"

  I bought Samsung Galaxy m21. It has a monster battery and quick access fingerprint reader. It has an awesome camera quality. Its interafce is flawless and a great combination of 6GB and 128GB memory. I think it is fantabulous product as a budget phone

"
"

  Its a dumb mobile. Highly disappointing  from Samsung. Very very poor signal reception  as compare to mi or honor mobile. When at same place mi or honor shows signal where's this M21 shows zero signal. Whats the purpose of the phone if u can't  make call in it. DISAPPOINTING...

"
"

  Though processing is good.... phone lacks in battery which doesn't  last long as boasted to be 60000 mah and camera which is worst being unable to click photos properly and as well as touch which is below par...Big Thumbs down...

"
"

  Fingerprint read is good but just .1sec delay sometimesBattery life is so amazing.and in dark mode battery keeps long time efficiency me in outside....Camera quality is awesome.... as usual samsung provides good cameras at all time.... i loved this product.....

"
"

  I have been using this phone for 15 days but heating problem persists . This phone has heating issue when mobile data is on and when charging is on.

"
"

  I review  after 2 days use,Out of 10...Camera 8Battery 10Display 10Fingerprint reader 9No heating problem, though i can not play any game.Multimedia  purpose 10.Medium first changing ,take time 0 to 100 % near about 2 hours.

  Samsung Galaxy m21 best phone but bild quality not very perfect or charging time long for all camera display performance very good & UI is the best for Samsung Galaxy m21 one UI clean UI not adds l like for clean & one UI Display best expectations perfect super Amoled display

"
"

  If you are wondering to buy sam21 ,i would definitely reccomend you to buy this phone. I have no complain ,its all good .And thanks amazon for the delivery no damage .

"
"

  Happy to purchase it. Quick delivery by Amazon .Safe packing.Rate is reasonable compare to other brand 6gb mobiles.Lovable camera quality.Valuable price. Overall- QUEEN OF M SERIES.6000 mah battery gives more life .This is the best mobile ever I had purchased.

"
"

  After using it now for almost three weeks, I can assure you that you can not find better phone than this in this price segment.The battery, the display, the ui, I can just go on and on.This is the best budget phone hands down!!!!

"
"

  Phone heats up issue everytime at the time of charging and on the video call.Finger censor not working everytime,Camera quality is every poor, especially front camera.

"
"

  I bought this phone on 4th june and got on 8th of june . First day itz battery bacup is awesome but  when i charge my device it takes about 4-5 hours to charge. I am really disappointed from this and now battery bacup is not too good and even the charging speed

"
"

  Am a Regular User, using CHROME, WHATSAPP, YOUTUBE and GMAIL.Because of the 6000 mah Battery. We forget our charger.But not suitable for Games.

"
"

  The fingerprint sensor is not good. It takes seconds to unlock. Sometimes it says not accepted. Overall, i find it is a good fast mobile. I am not a gamer. So i don't  know abt that. But for me, for normal browsing and app use, it is good.

"
"

  Very good performance of battery , but some times fingerprint reader not working properly, otherwise dlisplay is to good ,no other company will give u  sAMOLED display

"
"

  Truly and honestly, very amazing device, main highlite about m21 is its battery which is monster and ofcource display you are getting in this price is at par with any flagship device and especially DOLBY ATMOS SOUND will enhance your multimedia experience a lot.

"
"

  Camera could have better, the more important thing is back after a decade in mid-range smartphones. Battery is excellent and display is super üëå

"
"

  Review after one and half month of use.The smartphone is good but price is too high as Compared to other brands with feature. The phone even hangs sometimes and restarts automatically. Only for house use and not for official purposes

"
"

  After 2 months Not performing well , back is not good , it get scratched everywhere after use , also whenever taking selfie at the time of view photo converted to black image .I have not expected this from samsung.

"
"

  the only good thing about this phone is amoled display!!avg camerasbulkyslow charging!!there are much better options at this price range

"
"

  Product issued with defect and worst response from Amazon. I suggest users to shift to other platform compare to Amazon. Even with replacement policy I was not happy. Other than Amazon rest online sellers are far better. Thanking you the best and great customer trouble maker the Amazon.

"
"

  I have buy this phone 1 month ago.now I have realize that.overall phone is ok.but as Samsung claim 6000mah battery .battery  backup is not good and camera quality is not also as 48 mega pixel. Rest of features is good.

"
"

  Overall phone is good ,look is premium, battery life is too good, fingerprint sensor work smooth, However camera quality is not up to mrak ...However it's excellent if we compare this with chinees craps....

"
"

  Display clearty is wow...Battery  life.üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•Camera quality..üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•I purchased M21 Rs.12,200/- is worth..

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is excellent battery life is also good ....talking about camera which work really good ....I was short of cash when somehow I arranged and I buyed it ....it's satisfying for me to have such good phone under low budget....

"
"

  It heats a lot. Just after half an hour of usage the phone becomes hot like frying pan. All the other features are alright but this one problem makes it a worse purchase.After latest update the heating problem is solved and hence one star increased.

"
"

  Hello,  Actuallly the product is reallly awesome.... I am reallly thankful to Samsung and Amazon for this product.... Camera quality is reallly nice... Awesome display.... Battery backup is not excellent but goood.....reallly love this product... reallly awesomeüòçüòç

"
"

  Samsung M21, has an excellent battery backup, fair enough camera quality, super cool amoled display, good for multi tasking, charging speed is unbeatable,  all in all completely worth the price in this range. Super happy with the purchase & fast delivery by Amazon. Thanks!!

"
"

  camera quality is good its featurs are very goodbettery is monster that they claimfingerprint is working goodthing I dislike in it is its back cover  & its processorafter using for 8 days. I would say ...go for it

"
"

  I didn't expect Samsung product with so low quality. The screen just broke on keeping it over the table. When I call to the Amazon technician I was told it cannot be replaced.. üòûüòû

"
"

  I love to use Samsung M series because battery life and camera quality ...... All my family members using M series mobiles

"
"

  it's a really nice phone... features are also good according to the cost... and the best thing was next day delivery...

"
"

  Best budget non chinese phone from samsung .Gaming experience is very good and it performs fabulous in all game modes in pub but only some frame drop will be seen in ultra Hdr mode because processor is not for gaming but it is very good I love samsung

"
"

  ¬†All is good . But1.It take 3.5 hour to charge.2. Little bit hang .no such decent processor3. You have to use cover or skin on body otherwise get damage and scratches will come.Otherwise everything is great

"
"

  It's a great  phone for the  price and the best budget mobile. The camera is magnificent, it's super slow motion videos are awesome. Fingerprint readed very fast. Its huge battery life is one  point  to be  notes. A very good phone for moderate  users. Highly recommended üëç

"
"

  Best budget phone with expandable storage and the best part of this phone is that it has 6000mAh battery.Its camera quality is outstanding. I love this product.Last suggestion please update your phone after purchasing it then it will start his best performance.

"
"

  Really watta monster as it describes, 1st thing it's SAMOLED display stunning with its punchy colours, 2nd thing watta battery last upto 1.5 days of moderate use, 3rd is good camera, 4th is one UI 2.0 very smooth, last and important its a Samsung product brand conscious. Totally loved it

"
"

  Battery life is very good and fingerprint sensor is good and camera quality is very good and 4GB ram is good and smooth . Worth for the value . I suggest all should go for this product

"
"

  Overall a nice device.I got it for only 12699/-But now price us 13499/- bcz they launched m11 at 12499/-Battery screenshot attached don't know why it's showing 5820 mah instead of 6000mah.Overall a great device for samsung loversScreen quality us awesome.

"
"

  Everything great about phone but it is not suitable for pubg mobile but we can play pubg lite without lag and heat.Finger print is awesomeBattery backup is good but while watching in prime and hotstar draining fasterCamera quality is excellent

"
"

"

  It's a wonderful phone. The screen quality is amazing. Occasional stuttering. But that's ok me. Wanted to have sAmoled screen. And this phone perfectly met my expectation. Camera quality is average.

  Camera is good but while recording slowmo the screen flickers. It has weak network strength as compare to other phone. Only in simple browsing phone heat up . I bought it for 13999/ and not happy with product . Amazon is not refusing to refund on this bad services.

"
"

  Nice products in this budget. Display is very attractive and soft touch with best battery file.Charger is slow but okCamera quality very nice.Thanks amazon for in time delivery and samsung for very good product.

"
"

  Overall this is a very good mobile as all the features such as fingerprint scanner,camera,  sensors function well. Also the exynos 9611 processor and super amoled display is good. This is one of the best quality budget products by Samsung.

"
"

  Superb smartphone in this price range. Good camera quality. Good battery capacity. Display is awesome. Processor works very fluent. An awesome phone below 15000rs. Best samsung phone in low price..Tnqs amazon for delivering faster than expected..Tnqs amazon..

  Nice phone for 16k.It's been 2 weeks after buying this phone.it doesn't act like a 6000mah battery phone.charging is very slow.little bit heating issue is also there.camera is good not the best. Fingerprint is working very well now.overall it is good phone.4/5

"
"

  One of the worst mobile of my life . Full screen purple Blue black spot arise day by day then complete black  within 2 months. But service centre refuse to do warranty ,they charge me 5000 . It's really hurts .. never ever buy this mobile please please please.

"
"

  Considering A Samsung Branded Device For This Price Range It's Awsm SmartphoneOutstanding DisplayüíùOutstanding Battery LifeüíùAbove Average PerformanceüíùSmooth Gameplay-COD/PUBGüíùGreat Camera QualityüíùBut design Could Be Better,But It's Oküå∏

"
"

  Phone is good. Decent performance. But battery doesn't seem to be 6000mah. I dont have any games in my phone and i am a light user. But still am getting battery backup for around 26hrs.

"
"

  I like the camera best in this phone .The screen  to too good and its look like slim and sexy so i like bestBattery  life not realy like 6000 compare to other phone

"
"

  All over all I give 3.5/5 stars to this phone, everything is amazing as per the price 14k but it's charger should be atleast 20W instead of 15W as it takes lot of time to charge. Battery is 6000 maH but use to work like 5000 maH battery.

"
"

  I like everything about you phone ezample super amoled display is fantastic but you guys should improve the processor of the phone because users also jeed good processor and i think that exynos 9611 is not that good processor please you guys should improve the processor

"
"

  What a mobile in this range...Everyone should go blindly for it..I am advicing everyone bestever phone in this range...Very large battery backup..Camera quality is very good..Display ....‚ù§‚ù§ what a good....overallI am giving 4.8 out of 5

"
"

  One of third class phone. Heating problem as well as the battery backup is no so well and hang after uses sometimes. Don't by this phone.

"
"

  What I like most are1. The big battery which stay all the day.2. This phone is more strong in comparison to other Chinese brand phone since my daughter used to bang it whenever she is angry3. Camera is nice4. Light in weight

"
"

  The price before which was 12699 was very good which comes with sAMOLED display which was very nice but now the price of 13999 is very much many other phones are present in the market at this price but it is not Chinese.It is a very nice device overall.üëåüòá

"
"

  Finding difficult in downloading apps through google play store. Google out some possibilities but not working, not sure whether it is system problem or user inefficiency.  At this point, buyers like me prefer a personal assistence which amazon fails to provide.

"
"

  Its really nice phoneI don't  know  about othersBut my phone is superb perfectly  deleverd by the Amazon and Samsung have really done a great  job.Price to is too highAnd very disappointed for the battery life it  drains too quickly..

"
"

  Solid come back from Samsung with M series. Very good battery, best camera at this price. Best in class display. Fluid display..

  Mobile is decent in performance.  All thing is good regarding phone . Camera  is upto the mark but sometimes lag in opening . mobile  having a 15W charger which charges phone in 2.5h.Overall for day to day life uses its a monster device.

"
"

  Samsung is my all time favorite brand. And this time Samsung M21 just has a real monster battery backup,  I'm satisfied with its camera quality and functionalities. Biometrics sensor is also a good part of this mobile.Fully valued purchase. üëç

"
"

  Nothing to add more. The processor is weak. I havd normal non gaming apps, still ram buzzing around 70%. While my Samsung note 9 is loaded with ton of apps but ram occupied around 40%.Camera is OK.

"
"

  value for money...good camera, battery, display... but could've been better with Qualcomm snapdragon chipset

"
"

  Absolutely bang for the buck. Display is awesome and so is the overall phone. Highly recommend.

"
"

  It's very easy to break the screen. It slipped out of hand, not from height,from near the surface itself, and it broke. I've never seen a phone so fragile.

"
"

  If one is not a gamer then it is a perfect phone under 15k. The software is a delight to use and the screen is impeccable. The camera is usable as well. So if these are some of your needs. Then you would enjoy this smartphone.

"
"

  No notification led .. very slow charging....6000 mah battery but looks as normal as 4000...Just one hope left from Samsung - Realiability ...

"
"

  I have been using this phone for more than 2 weeks now. It's sleek, fast and easy to handle device. I always admired Samsung products and this phone stands true to the promises it makes to its users.

"
"

  Camera is wonderful, battery life is good, but one very big issue is hotspot does not work on laptops, wifi shows in other mobiles only. Company must update and resolve the issue. Otherwise very nice phone.

"
"

  It is looks like a wonderful product. I received it 2 days back .Camera Quality is awesome.Wonderful ProcessorWell Battery.i think its worthy buy..b

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is very quick action. Battery is awesome everyday I try to finish it but not done yet. Camara quality is also good. So many hidden/special features are available in this phone. If you have 15k budget so go for Samsung Galaxy M21.

"
"

  Thanks. Good value for money

"
"

  It's good for rough use though not fast  as china brands..but everything is above avg, long lasting..good quality, smooth etc.. slippery so get a case and if possible prefer the black colour cause my frnd has black and mine is blue..but her looks super cool..

"
"

  Samsung is samsung, great camera, great ui, great response time and above all made in India. Thank you Samsung team.

"
"

  I ordered m21 raveen black. Previously I used mi first I hesitate to order m21. My friend suggested this one. I love this mobile very much. Battery stands for 1.5 days minimum. Camera quality is good and processor is very good.

"
"

  M21 swithced off all of sudden and it got a spot on bottom left corner of screen.Samsung care says it doesn't not cover in warranty and will charge around 6k for it.Pathetic service.Please suggest further course of action.

"
"

  This is amazing. If you are not a gamer like me and you want amazing battery and supreme quality of display then this is the phone for you. No network issue. Watching movies is a next level experience. Heavy apps are not even an issue. A perfect phone with a decent camera.

"
"

  Not bad.Battery is like 3500 to 4000mah.Processor ok.Not exactly The Monster one.It's just ""Me Too A Product""""Samsung 21 is too a mobile phone..!""

"
"

  Heavy use phone üëåüëå

"
"

  Battery is monster as it says, I watched 5 movies and still 52% of my battery was left, you can analyze by that how important that turns out to be when you are on a long journey and your phone is your only partner, it must be lasting, amazing it already is.

"
"

  Battery  life is good, but charging takes time.Camera is good enough for me.If head phone socket and charger usb was on top it could have been better as we keep phone 0n a stand to listen or to watch. I can say it is a good phone.

"
"

  Worst production I have ever seen. Brought Samsung M21, faced touch screen not at all working and replacement received however problem remain same after 3 days touchscreen not at all working. Phone at usable. Worst product from Samsung.

"
"

  Mobile is goodCamera= superb even in low light , slightly slow motion mode is struggling but okBattery = average workingDisplay = mind blowingOverall = very niceAnd good thing is that it is not Chinese compani so I am happy with that

"
"

  Best phone in this prize range of 12700.# monster battery  lasts upto 1 day with extreme use# A1 camera specially night mode is awesome as well 48mp 3/4 photo.# 2.5 hr it takes for charging.# super amoled display.Overall nice phone.

"
"

  Last 5years I was big fan of Xiaomi but now thinks are changed because of India - China issue.M21 is really good without any doubt you just can go ahead and purchase it.

"
"

  The colour is very beautiful...loved it...nd it's super slow mo motion is amazing... pictures are as clear as reality. The features are also amazing, which i found only in this Samsung Galaxy phone, necessary are inbuilt, which i liked the most. JUST LOVING IT

"
"

  Awesome phone at this price and awesome performance  of 6 GB Ram with too much space and good camera quality.fully satisfied with this phone,super display, long battery backup,HD voice call and video quality.its really amazing phone by samsung at this price.worth of money

"
"

  Very Good Mobile & Low range also its made in India & thanks Amzon for giving me in 2 days in lockdown period.Battery backup very good,Camera also very good,Almond display also finger & face censer very good.Every India buy Samsung Product because its Made in India.

"
"

  With this rate I really admire samsung m21. Battery life is outstanding, so that I could attend my online classes without delay. Back cam is good, in a triple cam version. The only defect I could point out is that , it's fingerprint sensor takes some time to get detected.

"
"

  Looking nice and stylish. But no screen guard, earphone and back cover with it. price is high Rs13999 for this phone.

"
"

  In this mobile fingerprint Reader very Fast then others Mobile by Samsung..Awesome mobile.I will suggested all of you m21 mobile is superb.. Battery back up super yr.And Camera quality is soo superb.I like this Phone.. Thanx Samsung

"
"

  Best mobile phone in India.All the features are the best quality.And the phone's battery is biggest feature. I am very happy to purchase Samsung galaxy m21.This phone is a real mega monster.if you're looking a phone for purchase this is very best phone for you.

"
"

  I unpacked the phone, switched it on, and boom...it started heating like anything within 2 to 3 min of use....Two brands Amazon and Samsung...to whom one can blame.... immediately asked for return ..let see how it goes

"
"

  All Specifications are very good but battery performance and charging performance is not up to the mark as saidBattery acts like 4000 mah and not charging so fast as presented its take around more than three hours to charge fullNot feel of 6000 mah battery

"
"

  Huge battery life, excellent camera great performance. Dolby atmos sound in headset gives us a best sound quality. And the super Amoleddisplay is mindblowing. Samsung M21 is this price segment can beat any other brands.

"
"

  At the time of buying gorilla glass was included but that is not present in the box. Otherwise all the features are very good compared to mi redmi series

"
"

  good mobile, even after increasing the price, luckily, placed the order before the day of increasing price.camera: 4.8/5display: 5/5battery: 5/5charging speed: 4/5(2hr 40min for 0%-100%)processing speed: 4.5/5Design: 3/5

"
"

  I ordered Black coloured phone but they gave me blue coloured phone in the box of black coloured phoneThey thought they are smartBut blue is also okkSo I am not returning the phoneBut next time I'll not tolerate this

"
"

  It's been a week since I am using this phone. I bought this as a secondary phone and hardly make any calls. I just use couple of apps during the day. But, still, the battery almost dies out by the end of the day. By EOD, I would just have 20% or sometimes 30% battery.

"
"

  It's getting heated up very quickly. It's been 2 days that I have received the phone and even if I am using the phone (even calls) for 15-20 mins it's starts heating up very heavily.

"
"

  Dislike= 1)Network singnal performance is poor.2)Battery draining is quite fast .3)camera equality is not good as mentioned.4)Finally  processor performance is poor.Otherwise all is best.

"
"

  finger print reader is in the back .. its very fast and goodCamera quality is as they say... very goodBattery life is also good. And charging is also very fast.it doesnt have metal body, except that everything is very good

"
"

  Samsung products have never failed me. I use my phone extensively and the battery lasts more than a day. The camera quality and it's extra features are quite impressive. Overall a good phone for the price.

"
"

  ¬†Amazing mobile... we love amazon and Samsung.... camera quality amazing..Display luxury effect...Thanks Amazon and Flipkart

"
"

  Camera quality is amazing. Battery life is satisfactory. Fingerprint reader is very accurate. A good phone at the price with wide screen and beautiful graphics. Samsung never disappoints.

"
"

  Its good phone in this price range. Battery life is good.  Camera is  nit as expected

"
"

  It's a monster of smartphone for midrange amazing quality but little bit higher pricing of product but if you wanna good beast of midrange than can buy this with this budget

"
"

  It looks beautiful surely more beautiful in real.It got an amazing camera, it capture all possible details. Battery life has no questions, simply great. If your are reading this then u must buy this smartphone. Also they provide u amazing Samsung service. Proud user.

"
"

  On of the best products in its price range. However, it's weight is slightly higher.Overall an excellent phone from samsung.

"
"

  In mid range segment the best product, mobile in this price range best phone.Battery is to Good,Camera in this price range üëåüëå best,Performance and display better than Better üòäNot Monster it's a Mega MonsterBetter than Chinese companies üôÖ

"
"

  Battery backup is of 9Hrs with 27% juice still left. 48MP is incredibly detailed! One UI deserves a special mention.And then is the highlight of this device, the FHD+ AMOLED panel is gorgeous to watch coupled with the crisp Dolby Atmos output through the audio jack

"
"

  This phone comes with a bundle pack of features like best of best display ""super amoled  "" ,The best battery 6000 mah ,with fastcharging ,Rare mounted finger print scanner all together i can say it is the best phone that you can buy at this price

"
"

  NET SPEED IS MUCH FASTER IN MY FRIEND'S VIVO Y19 ESPECIALLY IN LOW NETWORK AREA INSPITE OF BOTH HAVING JIO SIM AND ALSO DURING CALLING AND RECEIVING SOMETIMES CANNOT LISTEN ANYTHING BUT AFTER RESTARTING IT GETS OK.MY MOBILE IS JUST TWO WEEKS OLD.

"
"

  Best Phone in thus price bucket with decent finger print Sensor,Massive Battery life indeed a MONSTER,and fair enough Camera quality.Dont go for A series of Samsung,M series provides you much more facilities with utilities at cheaper price.

"
"

  This an amazing phone after or successor of galaxy M30s. It gives you 2 days of battery, 48mp camera gives good photos and It's network and connectivity is extremely great. It is a worth of this price. I felt that fingerprint sensor could be a better one.

"
"

  Fingerprint reading in milli seconds ,battery getting down soonly but after 5 days it's  giving me super performance finally camera it's giving excellent performance

"
"

  Really wat a monster  the mind blowing  phone I have ever used inths price the fingerprint reader was like ultra fast. No words to the battery one time charge can play pubg continously  for 8-10hrs. If u come to camera no need to buy camera while ths phone is in ur hands wat a monster

"
"

  Very worst Mobile and Company, very very very delicate.. within 10 days display broken. Worst response from Samsung and biggest irresponsible Amazon site. Worst worst worst service. Flipkart is  100 times better than Amazon. No customer service. Amazon is not helping.

"
"

  My mobile phone has not coming a sound while playing YouTube movies since I purchased it backed  not recovered it not working of keypad worst of money please replacement of genuine mobile another new one. Mobile if not I will complaint higher  please I want replacement

"
"

  Keep up the spirit samsung, this is how you can be a leader in India.. and Get the throne back!

"
"

  Phone was amazing but fingerprint couldn't response as fast as it can and battery life of m21 is poor compare to m30. Sometimes it hanging..... overall product was good but it requires improvement.

"
"

  Helishly worst battery lifeGiven that it has 6000 mAH battery but of no use it drains fast some times and sometimes lives quite longer. Otherwise mobile is best of all. First in class and budget very good mobile except battery

"
"

  Pros _ nice camera , nice fingerprint fast work , massive battery,  continuosly use about 8  hours . Cons _ charging take 0 to 100 about 2 hours:50 minutes or  to get 100%  charged

"
"

  Had a bad experience with mobile screen after a month use suddenly stopped working. Went to gallery where they replaced the screen. Next day has some issue with mic opposite person was able to hear my voice. Later sfter switch off and on it started working.

"
"

  first purchased mobile was heating up when we charge it or while talking in phone then we asked for the replace of the mobile amazon customer care has called us and they have directed us for the replacement process and we got the new one and it was perfect.

"
"

  Value for moneyI have chosen this phone because of its screen.It takes nearly 3 hours for 100% chargingBattery life is excellentGood camera

"
"

  Overall good phone in this price category .However1) there is no headphone ** SHOULD BE ADDED*2) No usb c to lightening convertor ( this is okay)

"
"

  Superb display and battery audio quality is also good camera is OK ok finger print sensor not upto the mark great phone for normal users as compared to Chinese smartphone brands.

"
"

  This mobile contain a awesome screen but this get very scratch about  fingerprint this is not bad means average the thing which I like so that is his camera quality and battery life and also this phone display this is like a stone .some times I saw few lags in backing scrolling

"
"

  At a galance it is a ""wow"" phone. The most impressive think is it's battery life. In a normal use it can servibe 3 days(aprox),heavy use one day. It camera quality is very god. But is fingerprint is quite slow. And it's display is ""aswam"". On internet issue.

"
"

  it is a very good quality ph. but there is a major problem of rebooting.camera batterylife display quality is excelent  also amejan customer care deptt. is very helpful and when i returned  the mobile they refund my amt within 2 days. thanks amejan.

"
"

  Fingerprint scanner stopped working and the camera is sucks. The screen also has this weird yellow tint. Comes with lot of bloatware.

"
"

  Nice product.Battery lasts for almost 2 days.Camera is goodFingerprint reader is smoothProcessor is okayTouch screen is smooth

"
"

  See, the box got suppressed. I expected a corrugated box pack over the Samsung original small soft carton mobile packagaing. Fortunately nothing happened to item inside and I was upset, as I carried previous box as such like new and replaced with old piece.

"
"

  When i get this phone i used and open my account. After 10 days it is switching off automatically. When gave it to customer care centre two - three times but the problem is continue . So i am appealing you that you should take action on them or i want the refund  money to my account.

"
"

  Good batteryLow battery charging speed 1% in 2 min approxBoth rear and front cameras are not to expectationZooming reduces clasrity drasticallyVerdict.  : go for other phones like redmi note 9 pro max or redmi note 8 or moto g8 power lite or moto one macro

"
"

  The features of this phone is awesome . The camera quality is so nice. The screen is good, the smoothness of screen is nice. The battery has awesome life .when we charge the phone 100% it can run almost 7-8 hours continuously . video quality is also good.

"
"

  I use 7 hours continues  daily base but battery is really good  levelCamera is genuine good at outdore but inside low light I think little problem occursNo leg isue or any kind of problem foundOver all good phone  balanced..

"
"

  Used  two months, than review all are best  other  things that are one of than  camera good, backup are good used 24 hours above

"
"

  Hello, I see some problem with the calling quality. The voice drops happen many times. The mobile is good, but may be the problem with the mobile speaker or receiver.

"
"

  Charging port of phone stopped working after one month.....service center will be replacing charging port. Once charging port has been replaced, fingerprint sensor stopped working.  Ha ha, I pity Samsung brand phones

"
"

  Good phone for the price point. It is certainly a phone for high media consumption folks. Screen quality is just amazing! Good battery back up and decent camera.Above all is the amazing One UI experience that will make you fall in love with this phone.

"
"

  I am not happy with samsung galaxy m21I already 2 times visits samsung services center after purchasing this phone so if you want to buy samsung phone than go for high-end phone otherwise you will not satisfied with this product

"
"

  This is perhaps the best phone in this segment and I feel no other phone has such a value for moneu.Pros: Great screenAwesome batteryAndroid 10Cons: Exynos instead of Snapdragon processorCamera could be better

"
"

  The best part of Samsung M21 is Monster Battery that last long for 2 Days,Super Amoled display gives you a better cinematic experience with great clearity,Samsung M series is budget smartphone with the features of flagship smartphone

"
"

  It looks very cheap,, specially feel is not premium...Camera live focus is good ,but pix completely destroyed when at wide angle mode..Sound is average...Speaker position is odd,,get pressed during eating movie....Overall experience is highly dissatiesfactoy........

"
"

  A monster by Samsung. First time I'm  using any Samsung smartphone by seeing the features. Its features are awesome. A rival for any Chinese smartphone in this budget. Thanku samsung. And also manufactured in India. So, India walon dil SE kharido Samsung M21.

"
"

  Everything is fine, only 2 cons, 1st is Light Sensor, 2nd is Fast charger is not at all apt, it should have minimum 25watts Fast charger

"
"

  Good product , battery life is good, looking are good....But camera is not effective

"
"

  Camera quality needs to improve also the face unlock is the slowest. But that's not what the phone is for. Its display is crisp and battery is great. Does every job that other phones do. Its great purchase

"
"

  Worst experience of my life, its old technology phone.Mi note5 pro is much much better then this.I feel cheated by buying this.Seems not easy  to return it.Even my date of return is remain.

"
"

  This is the best alternate for non Chinese phone. Am not a techie. But all I can say is you've got better battery life. It lasts for 36hours. As always Samsung's display is the best. Easy to handle. But it's a little bulky.

"
"

  Very good performance, *fingerprint very fast*Battery 2 days*Camera very good quality* Display super AMOLED

"
"

  Don't buy this.its hang and restating.very bad service from Samsung care. they denaid to repair.dont purchase Samsung and avoid amazon.both r chected customer. I file a complin against Samsung soon.if avoid to harrassment and mental pressure plz don't buy Samsung

"
"

  I bought this phone 3 months back and buying this has been a good decision.Battery life is good it can easily go for 24 hrs at a stretch.  Camera is also good. I am disappointed with fingerprint sensor though as it is not much responsive.Overall it's good.

"
"

  Better phone for mid price range..Camera, processor and other config. Is better at this price. Battery backup is also good as of 60000mAh. But charging time is main concern...it should be better if charging time would low or simialr to other same range phones ..

"
"

  This is really a WATTA phone, it has amazing battery life, super aMoled display, Camera quality is super. Over all it is awesome phone in budget you get.

"
"

  Good value for money phone with good battery life, only 1 problem is it takes almost 3 hours to fully charge the device

"
"

  Brilliant camera, huge battery life and brilliant display, brilliant fingerprint reader , in addition with the premium feeling of SAMSUNG. Best phone for gaming ,studies , browsing , and office works. BEST PHONE EVER. with minimal cost and most affordable.

"
"

  Better than redmi, realme  and all other variant.

"
"

  A great phone. Beautiful screen, Battery which refuses to die. Above average camera. Basically a phone which offer more than its share of value for money. Best part is it's Made in India.

"
"

  Best phone at this price. Selfie camera is best in this segment. Fingerprints not work properlu sometimes battery life is more than expectations overall gud product from samsung

"
"

  This is very good for me... touch, camera alll good, battery is best, i am not a gamer so i buy for battery power only ... if u efford 16k then go for m40 for gaming... bt for daily basis use, it is a perfect monster.....

"
"

  I've used the set for 25 days. Selfi camera has disappointed me a lot . Primary camera is ok but not up to my expectations. Battery takes long 3 hours to get it fully charged and drained it within 24 hours. Display is good. This is not a handy device for pubg lover.

"
"

  Only good thing about the phone is display and battery backup. All other features are below average. Having issues with network signal strength. My oppo f15 is showing three bars where as M21 is showing zero or one bar at the same place.  Totally disappointed.

"
"

  This is such a wholesome phone ..... I love it . Smooth , classy . I have been using samsung for a long time but mahn this tops it like no other . Best value for money from Samsung

"
"

  Its an excellent features mobile phone in low budget produced by Samsung. I think features added in this mobile is more enough than for normal user. Its battery life is markable. Storage and Ram was excellent. I will give 5star for this mobile.

"
"

  Samsung M21 purchased through Amazon.in which is the best mobile using Very nice photos are so clear camera is so nice. Storage capacity 64GB with6GB . I like this mobkle it is very good working with fast tuch moments. Best mobile in this range.

"
"

  Fingerprint is slow sena and battery backup is to good and camera quality is best but click time is slow.

"
"

  Worth for money above avg display and battery life ... good camera and recording  slow motion is very bad  ultra slow motion is very good  avg experience for gaming avg for pubg high frame per sec is provided seeking for a budget phone under 15000 will be a great option

"
"

  Network keeps switching from 4g to 2g simultaneously.  Waste of purchasing this mobile. After one month usage . The mobile is worst performing waste of money

"
"

  Sim signals is not getting properly got only LTE not get volte and 4g signel so download and browsing is very very slow not satisfied don't buy

"
"

  I liked the product very much ...best product ever .I am writing this review from this Mobile only...Goo...for it

"
"

  Phone is perfect. My dad loved it I am using M20, but M21 is much more better truly awesome. High five Samsung.

"
"

  Good:M21 camera quality is very goodPicture qualityNot good:Mobile getting heat when you play games like pubgCharger wire is too short

"
"

  Very good quallity phone..... but i think samsung should upgrade their processor... camera quality not bad at all... it has different types of mode... but not like others.... but its display is super cool..... its a very high quallity display...  also its waterproof.....

"
"

  This phone meets all my expectations. A lot of features in such a price. It has all the features I wanted.  I think this is the best phone in this price segment with brand value . I purchased 6GB 128 GB variant. Fingerprint reader,  battery life quite ok.

"
"

  Its about 1 week i m using this phoneIts camera quality is not gud as Samsung give it an older phonePortrait mode is also not as i expectedOver all phone is good but can't play heavy game like pubg too mucch lagCamera is just awful

"
"

  Nice mobile I ever seen, the camera, powerful battery, fingerprint, display and many more features . I loved this mobile. This mobile set is use full in long journey because 6000mah battery not a joke rely use full in emergency cases thanku so much to M21

"
"

  Guys, I really thankful to Amazon for selling such a best mobile with fast speed, strong, long battery, nice picture quality.its 1000 percent value for money. Don't read others feedback, I m very honest while writing this. Take this without second thought.

"
"

  Design not so good like premiumBattery life and display is awesomeCamera is not up to the markLumsum it's good to buyAll well gameplay is best no heating too muchCharging well and fastAll well üôÇüôÇ

"
"

  Good phone with good price.Battery life is good. Have lots of option to explore in camera. Good quality photos and videos you can capture/ record.My second exp. with samsung and believe me it is awsome one. Budget phone with best in-built feature.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone , itIs totally waste of your money,I bought this phone before 25 days and within 25 days i faced lots of problems in this phone, battery quality is very poor and nowIt's touchIs not working.I am totally upset to buy this phone.

"
"

  Firstly, when I unboxed the phone I literally loved it. Then I check its camera firstly I love it, especially its front camera. Obviously fingerprint reader is the best one. Last but not least battery life, I'm a average user so my opinion is 4.5/ 5 star for battery.

"
"

  This is the best phone in this budget I believe. I never wanted to buy a Chinese  phone and after a lot of research  I found this the best phone. No second  thoughts  just  go for it. üòÅ

"
"

  Unless you're a hardcore gamer, this phone is the best choice right now in the market.. awesosome ui, awesome battery, awesome display, awesome camera, everything is just fantastic. But if you're gonna play pubg like 3-4 hrs a day , only then you should consider other options..

"
"

  I like everything of this phone except of just back body and processorAlthough I have applied cover so body is not issue any more but processor should be better it produces heat alot But in winter it would be okay Rest I like this phone

"
"

  Fingerprint reader: get it works done smart wayBattery life: goodCamera: awesome the bestDisplay: as usual samsung the bestSpeed: its been more than a month i did not see it got stuck any whereCost: its a budget phone with good quality

"
"

  Main camera, battery life , memory space all are very good, value for the money product. Front camera is good but not up to the mark. Fingerprint reader is slower than other mobile, it can be improved. But overall the set is very good and user friendly. Go for it.

"
"

  Superb phone as expectedBest ever featuresTHE MOST COST RELIABLE PHONEThe best among its competentsüëç6000mah üîã48mp üì∑6gb ram128gb internal memoryBy a South Korean brand like Samsung is overwhelmingly an extravaganza

"
"

  Yup overall phone is good in budget its monster battery is amazing and can easily give backup upto 1.5 days with a sinhle charge camera is also good And most amazingly is its SAmoled display is such amazing that you can enjoy your content in so much High Definition ‚ô•Ô∏è

"
"

  Earphones - I received phone today and there are no earphones in it. Is this expected?

"
"

  Best phone for budget... 6000mah is an insane battery power. 4GB RAM paired with 2.3ghz processor and 64GB storage is optimal for daily use and fast operations. Definitely recommended for buying

"
"

  Selfie camera is not experiencing like 20 Mp as witten by company, design is not impressive as other companies like mi,infinix,oppo etc are giving in this price range or even in low price range then it.

"
"

  If this same phone ,with better processor and improved body quality  is made it would be one of the best phones ever made . It could cost around 20000 but it would kill all other brands in compitition.

"
"

  It reads fingerprints quickly . Battery stands for long time and I have to charge mobile after 3 to 4days. It has superb camera quality its pro mode is brilliant. We can also make emoji with our face .Selfie also comes great . I suggest everyone to buy this product.

"
"

  Samsung M21 is greatest one edition in this segment. M21 is feel original brand feeling is awesome. I am realy enjoy bought this phone...1.Good Camera2.Good Battery life3.Very good value for moneySamsung competition only Samsung.

"
"

  Speker , network issue

"
"

  It's a good budget phone with lots of specification. Till now I am impressed with the working of phone especially wrt battery life, memory space, camera quality, handy etc. But a lacuna that I could find is in regard to the insufficient  length  of the  travel adapter.

"
"

  Overall not as per expectation, slow processorWorst part it fall down from less than a feet while charging phone and they charged 5500 for changing glass. That too within a less than a month of purchase. What a poor quality product

"
"

  Product is good, but Samsung is reducing quality level of parts day by day. Sim holder is very low quality. It may break anytime. Camera and processor speed is good. Battery draining like 3000mah in single day.

"
"

  Battery life is not good with in less time it became battery lowI have ordered this for battery capacity 6000mah but i'm dissapointed with battery.

"
"

  Battery is not charging fast it is taking 6 hrs to get fully charged even fast charging option is enabled.Phone is good but battery and hang issues are not solved.sometimes it stops working suddenly . Battery is as not working as mentioned . Draining fast

"
"

  Battery life is good camera quality is good better than other chaina ptoduct fingerprint reader is good  But is box no cover case and head phone 13999/price range

"
"

  Wonderful gadget & lovely performance. Happy to buy a made in India product. Compatible with all bluetooth devices. Camera is superb. Battery life could have been better. But overall a great product. Happy buyer for Samsung

"
"

  BUDGET FRIENDLY PHONE. AVAILABLE  WITH BEST FEATURE AS COMPARED TO OTHER BRANDS. IF YOU CANT GO FOR M31 THEN MUST BUY THIS.Battery performance,  look, camera,  android version,  preinstalled apps. Awesome

  It easy to use and  it's doing good  nd wellCamera quality is awesome  and depth camera also goodAnd the design of the phone better for this range based on the moneyBattery life very good for usingAnd proformance of phone and processer is good

"
"

  Fingerprint Reader is really quick in responding. Battery life is excellent , once after charging the phone in morning its lasts really long.  The camera quality is really excellent with very good quality photos. The look of the phone is very attractive.

"
"

  Perfect budget smartphone. Superb screen, massive battery and a decent camera. Camera's natural light photos are great though the night ones have some noise. But that's fine keeping in mind the price point.Overall a great buy at this price segment.

"
"

  Bettery will lasts just one for ordinary usage and fast charger will take atleast 3 hour to charge full.  The mobile have  heating problem and speaker not working some time.  6 months of use comapare to chinese phones display only have better performance

"
"

  I have purchased the Samsung M21 before (Aug20) two months. Till now don't come any issues in performance. 6000mAh Battery standing day and night. High sensitive finger print sensor. Amazing camera quality. Overall excellent performance for budget prise.

"
"

  Purchased it in May,2020, a blackspot appeared on screen in September,2020 and the spot is enlarging day by day. It is creating an hazy display view on screen leading unreadable condition. I am hopeless with this product.

"
"

  Charging to slow phone is not responding properly pathetic purchaseThird class product quality getting problem with in 3monthsScreen getting blinked and hanged for several hours it seems refurbished handset sold by Samsung third class quality

"
"

  Awesome phone with greatest battery life.  camera  is alo best. fingerprint reader is so quickest. Screen is best and video experience was great with this phone.

"
"

  Very good and affordable prices This phone ""camera quality"" is awesome gives you real experience of photography""Fingerprint sensor"" is fastest quick response ""Battery life"" cool very good battery backups sach a cool and ""paisa-vasool gadget

"
"

  This is an excellent device as per daily driver, way way better than any other brand smartphone in this range. Very light in weight, beautiful screen, amazing features on OneUI, one will not regret the buy.

"
"

  Charging heat problem.double seal in the pack .Used MobileBattery life very poorI need replacement if possibleI will recommend you all don't buy from this seller.

"
"

  Camera works wonderfully. I bought this phone for my mother and I must say I feel sad. M21 has way better battery life than my current A50.The face recognition needs a bit more development.

"
"

  I will not recommendation this fone to buy any one because it Display is break down and company give coupon and u will buy again samsung fone again at higher price from samsung store.I will recommendation not to but any fone of samsung.

"
"

  Really liked the product. I had left the samsung ecosystem after a very bad experience with TouchWiz UI. The new One UI hasn't disappointed me at all. One of the best decisions I've made. Camera quality better than I anticipated even at 12MP.

"
"

  Overall it is good but cannot feel that I am using 6GB Ram, still haven't configured all my office emails but seems phone hangs at times.Camera quality is good with all filters and advanced features. All in all good phone in price range

"
"

  Pros:1.6000 battery is good2.processing is fast 6 gb ram3.user friendly interface  with uiCon1.improve selfi camera2.notification indicator is missingOver all 4 out of 5 ratings

"
"

  Buy it for media consumption and it wont disappoint. A good phone for day to day tasks. Don‚Äôt expect it to be anything else, know your requirements and chose accordingly.I don‚Äôt really mind its flows. It serves me it purpose.

"
"

  Very disappointed with battery and performs I never suggest anybody to go for Samsung. Except super amoled display. And when requested for replacement they suggested to download app and that time it was working fine. But you have difficulty regular use.

"
"

  I'm really disappointed, I choose Samsung Over Redmi note 9 pro..But I swear the front camera 20 mp..Is the worst camera I ever had..It's like 2mp

"
"

  1. Price range is best2. Camera is best3. Battery is best4. Samsung brand name is best5. Boycott China is one of the main reason.

"
"

  After 15 days of use a purple black mark formed on the screen without any physical damage.when I go to service center then he said this problem doesn't cover warranty and you have to pay Rs 6100 for sort out the issue. So my dear friend don't buy Samsung m21

"
"

  LIKE:performance,display quality and battery lifeHowever it takes about 2:30 to 3 hrs to charge completelyit doesn't feel more premium in hand

"
"

  Pros:UI of Samsung, RAM and ROM size is perfect for the use, Wide Angle Camera, Battery is huge.Cons:Quality of photos in Wide Angle is not so good, Sometimes phone starts lagging, Front camera is also not so good, Takes too much time to charge.

"
"

  Amazon delivered a faulty piece with a maligned camera , really disappointed

"
"

  Battery life was fantastic like a monster. Super amoled display is really great to watch movies showing punchy colors. Camera performance is also good. Really i love this Samsung oneui 2.0.I became a fan of it.#Whatamonster#samsunglove

"
"

  Phn screen get purple and then balacked whole, after 3 week of buying.Bad experience full wastage of moneyNot happy with this order fully unsatisfied with phn

"
"

  Excellent product by samsung. Camera also excellent in day light. Fingerprint is very fast. UI is very smooth.Sometimes it feel like 90hz dispaly so smooth, no adds ,display is like flagship catagory. Network receptivity is good. Overall very good product.

"
"

  DearI bought new samsung m21As I started it. It''s says reboot and lots of options. Which I never get in new phone. It''s keep restarted.Worst phone I ever seen

"
"

  Good budget with all features for daily usage.. I don't  used to play games.Back panel is too slippery..

"
"

  Product seems to be good. Regarding,Finger print reader not yet tried.Two says not enough to review battery life.

"
"

  My advice pls don't purchase Samsung mobileRegarding this mobile battery backup is not according to 6000 mah. And touch screen is also not good .Indexing also not ok

"
"

  In just two weeks mobile goes blank with power on and not able to switch off. Not sure of quality as fresh sticker has been pasted o.  date of manufacture date sticker .Looks like something has gone wrong and a returned mobile has been sold as new one

"
"

  Best phone for daily usage and for watching web series or movies display is too good and attery is totally amazing if you are thinking for gaming then this phone is not so good u should go for realme 6 or 6i but best for normal usage

"
"

  The finger print reader is fast and it unlocks the phone easily ,battery life is good if u are a gamer it will give a battery life of 7 hrs continuously and back camera is good but the front camera is not good for low light pictures  rest the phone is best at this price range

"
"

  M21 is awesome phone looks premium and usage and touch is very  very smooth only problems is battery back last for 1day.

"
"

  I liked the pop up for the notifications which we can directly reply the msgs. A lot of features are available, but still I didn't go through yet. Really monster battery. Nice one.

"
"

  Writing this review after using the phone for 10 days. Display, Battery, Camera all are good but the charger provided in box should have of more capacity than 15W bcoz it takes close to 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%....so it is not really a fast charging capable smartphone.

"
"

  Battery capacity  6000mah not trustable,Everything  is as good  as Samsung's  user manual.

"
"

  Awsome product. Would reccomend this to everyone. Thanks amazonüòÄ‚ù§ it has got a very good camera quality also and the fingerprint scanner is also very fast

"
"

  Some Apps not working properly such as  bluetooth and samsung keypad. Speed is very slow and very poor performance of this phone . This phone has been hang more times. This product quality is very poor and it's very bad to amazon.

"
"

  Good product, as compare to price. So I will recommend you guys. If your planing to have smart phone in low price but the good product you definitely go for it.

"
"

  Sound quality seems to be a bit low when compared to Lenovo K4 note which I possessed earlier. Fingerprint sensor is okay. Camera quality is good.

"
"

  I got this product only for 7500 after exchanging my old phone. Very good phone.. Best part is camera and batteryI didn't expect this much satisfaction level from new Samsung phone.. Samsung M series could be a game changer in the market in upcoming time

"
"

  With in a week my Samsung Galaxy m21 has got board problem. when i went to service centre they told to solve in two days, but later they told it wil take 2 weeksIf they would tell me before that it will take 2 week then i would have returnd the order for my galaxy m21

"
"

  1.The dynamic range of the photos are good.2.The battery  lasts for 2 days for average usage.3.The highlighted feature for me is the amoled display which gives you the best mobile media consumption experience.4.One UI 2.0 is intuitive

"
"

  The Performance Of Mobile Is Very Nice. The Camera Image Quality Is Awesome And Also Battery Backup Is Huge. The Display Is Brilliant  With The Premium feeling. The Use Fingerprint Is Smooth And Fast. It Is Best Mobile All Over India Under This Budget.

"
"

  This mobile us really awesome, specially Camera n Battery backup. Just I am facing network issues... its connectivity is little less than Mi... but not big issue.Purchased Samsung after long time hope they have rectified all earlier issues... !!!

"
"

  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PHONE!!!Brilliant camera, Humongous battery.. performance is by and large fantastic.Camera has AI which is awesome..Also longevity of BUTTONS increases if enabled Assistant Menu!Best phone for it gives premium feeling!!!!

"
"

  Received in Good Condition. Bought this for my Mom who expects sufficient Storage, good Camera quality and Battery life. Yea!! Her expectations are fulfilled!!

"
"

  Product is very good. But the packing you have given is not well..only a single box should be damage the phone in courier travel.. It is very disappointing while buying such expensive or electronic products.. Kindly take care of this.. Otherwise mobile is Good..

"
"

  The battery is not getting charged properly and quickly. It took me almost 2 hrs to get it charged I'm planning to return the phone

"
"

  Best product... Cam is superbBattery capacity is adjustableDesign is excellent ü§†Personally... Cam is fabulous ‚ò∫Ô∏èI really love to use this particular Phone üì±

"
"

  Good phone but build quality could have been better considering the price.Battery life is very good. Camera is also good.Processor used is not as good as competitors.Apply case and tempered glass as this phone gets scratches very easily.

"
"

  If you want to play pubg in it.so plz don't buy this product it does not give frame rate like smooth+extreme .it likes that you are playing on smooth+medium .but it is excellent product for non gamers or who play small games it is good for daily uses!!

"
"

  It's Battery life is superb and best in the range.It's design is  so cute and arustricatic that I am in love with this phone.Only difficulty is its technique to take screen shot is not so handy. Another complain is it is almost similar phone like MI A2.

"
"

  Charger is not good at all, not sure problem is with charger or the charger provided along with Phone is having some problem. When charging pone thorough charger received along with pack taking long time to charge the phone.Bad experience with Charger.

"
"

  Great product at great price.I got this mobile at just ‚Çπ 7649 with exchange offer.The Big thing is, i got ‚Çπ5000 off on my older phone that is 4 years old.

"
"

  OTG it's not working.. And apps many times stopped working, throwing to home screen.Camera quality is average. Mobile feels in hands like toy phone

"
"

  Mobile is good.  We recieved mobile and only charger .but it's a rainy season so packing should have  been in babbl paper.but it's only a box which is not even  tightly pack.

"
"

  Nice mobile long battery life

"
"

  I am writing my review after use of two day of M21.Both (Rear &  front )Camera quality SuperbBatter backup is absolutely fineGreat touch screenCan play games without any distortionCharging is greatOverall a great phone.Go for it

"
"

  Samsung has increased it's level in lower segment mobile phones this is and this one is indeed a monster .Loaded with features , Triple camera , super amoled display , long lasting battery probably best mobile in this segment.

"
"

  After using  phone  for 3 months phone  is working  very  seamlessly  plus  updation  are very  good dark theme  is also very effective  and best part of  Samsung  phone is each functionality  is defined  separately  so user have the option  to use functionality .

"
"

  The phone worked really well for a budget phone ,it has amazing game launcher along with its performance being amazing with a few fps drops  ot being a major issue .the phone is regular with its app updates and new features .worth the money

"
"

  Best for the price. Don't waste your money on M30s or M31 or M31s as all have the same chipset and the cameras are so similar 99% people won't even be able to tell the difference. M31s might look a bit different but not worth the extra ‚Çπ5k.

"
"

  It compelled me to download and use unnecessary programs games shopping etc. I don't want your personal browser. I shall use whatever I want chrome/mozilla etc. Don't make me use your personal browser.  Some unusual traffic  you must find if you're using Samsung

"
"

  I hav purchase this mobile last month, but hanging problem, touch problem, many other problems, I never suggest to purchase this mobile... and today I was visited Samsung customers service Gurgaon sector 15, but not satisfied reply... I m very frustrate

"
"

  Excellent phone with good battery life. Very good OS fast working and great look. Camera quality also good click more real image with bright color contrast and have so many option. Audio and call sound also loud and clear. Best Mobile at this range üëç

"
"

  Amazing Product. Good Performance , decent camera with excellent battery life. Value for money mobile with the trust of Samsung brand. Much better than similarly priced Chinese competitors.

"
"

  Performs smoothly. Not much bloatware.Simple, budget friendly.Indian made.Totally can rock it for another 1 year easy.

"
"

  Best smart phone Galaxy M21 (6 GB RAM 128GB memory) in affordable price with 48 MP camera with good battery back up,touch is fantastic, it's worth the money. Slim,light weight, easy to handle and fast charging is very useful.

"
"

  Superb mobile for this 15k range so i would recommend to go for this without doubt.Really satisfied...

"
"

  If you want quality over quantity then go for Samsung 4.5/5 (for battery)4.0/5 (for display)4.5/5 (for price valve)(Don't waste money on Oppo,vivo,xiomi,poco,Redmi phone)

"
"

  Not a up to the mark phone... I bought it early of the month... And unfortunately it shows its standard... Samsung is worse in providing good processor mobile phones, the words are true indeed. Phone is hanging a lot while operating the phone with basic utilities....

"
"

  Loved it the moment I opened the box..incredible phone with all the features running smoothly..be it touch screen, camera, battery life, processor etc..I was using Samsung mobile earlier also and the faith has been once again reposed..Alok Kumar

"
"

  I really liked the product and it has good battery life and features.If anyone is looking for a stable phone and a good battery life , this is the phone for u.Quality is good and I buyed another phone for my dad as I was impressed by this.

"
"

  Amazing phone with amazing display at this price range from Samsung... But major negative in this phone is the processor i face the issue when i play pubg like heavy games other wise no issues... I strongly recommended this mobile for normal usage....

"
"

  Actually I shifted to samsung just to dump my chinese gadget. I have used it for quite some time. I have purchased second device in a month. One gifted to my wife. Everything is perfect. Perfect price with perfect features. I am happy with the purchases.

"
"

  Amazing battery life with the decent performance I am playing pubg and battery life is excellent the camera is amazing thank you Samsung

"
"

  Fingerprint placement behind the screen is within the reach of fingers and easily accessible, battery is very powerful with respect to backup , charger is ultimate which provides fast charging.Camera is awesome because of it‚Äôs picture quality.

"
"

  One of the best mobile in Samsung's galaxy series.Best in camera, best in processor.Camera quality is superb nd battery life is also long nd charges very fast with type-charger.Overall best product.As usual before time delivery by Amazon üëç

"
"

  Mobile premium feeling in hand, Awesome Battery life, Super camera quality, fast fingerprint scanner, Very fast RAM management, super wifi calling facility, Fast charging, and Awesome feeling, super product, I'm very happy about this mobile. Thank you Samsungüòò

"
"

  Best budget phone under 15K. I Liked this phone too much that i recommend this phone for everyone. Battery life is so good that if you charge this phone to 100 and use it heavily for 1 day and still almost 25 to 30% battery still remains. So good. Go nd buy now

"
"

  Its a good phone with excellent performance.  Camera is good quality one. Batery capacity is also good. Secure folder option doesnot found in this phone. S Secure is also not in it.

"
"

  Camera quality is good. Battery backup is for 1 day. Smooth working apps with 4GB Ram. Best part is its value for price. If you want a smartphone below ‚Çπ15,000, you should definitely buy this non-Chinese mobile. I have bought it a week ago.

"
"

  Perfect phone for those who mainly love social media and watches videos. Super display and battery life. Only issue it takes long time to charge the phone, maybe because of the huge battery.

"
"

  It worst mobile, don't but it, because it is hanging, heating, sensar ,less battery backup, automatically switched off, I am contact with Amazon care, but they r not responding properly, and not able to solve my problem. Tq

"
"

  Its just amazing, you can buy this blindly amazing battery life for a person like me it goes on for nearly 1.5 days, it feel like high end phone just protect back from scratches, you will be happy to buy this and useüòÅ

"
"

  It works, but it turns very hot during charging. The charger is also seemed defective. I tried to chat live  or visit your website on 8th June'20, but due to lock down situation I wasn't offered any service. So replacement was not possible.The front camera has no flash.

"
"

  battery is not up to level.call is not clear when you use sim 2 for internet and sim for call.back cover poor quality. i think its made from plastic. easily it can scratched.you have to install application for Internet speed and screen record etc.

"
"

  Everything is good yes charging takes a long time but thats not a big issue.....camera is great at this price point display is too good and vivid u feel that amoledy goodness.....good phone at this pricepoint

"
"

  Absolutely value for money. Great battery, superb camera and above all Made in India.

"
"

  Galaxy M21 plus point is battery, else other features are OK. Recommending only to those who have low usage. If you have high usage then u should opt for its 6GB variant because phone response has slowed down in 2 weeks time only.

"
"

  The best phone in the budget of below 15k. The Battery life is better than any phones out there. Camera quality is the best. The body of the mobile is sleek and modern.

"
"

  This device is awesome.i am impressed by it's camera quality.the super slow motion and wide angle photos are at high level . It's battery life is enough for a normal user and also for a gamer.sound quality is good and it has flat cameras. no hanging and laging problem.

"
"

  I bought this Samsung m21 mobile last week.Im amazed and I can't Express my thanks in words.Awesome battery life.No hang.Excellent speed.Fingerprint sensor is very outstanding.I recommend that this is the best phone in this price category that everyone should buy.

"
"

  The product was very nice.delivered in good condition. The product was safely packed with the seal without broken I love this device

"
"

  I have purchased by seeing it's camera configuration and memory. But it's camera 48 mega pixel is totally worst not even perform like 8 mega pixel. Speaker sound is totally waste. This product not worth for money as they charge.

"
"

  Over heating problem in the front camera portion while making calls, using camera,internet and chatging. Battery draining problem after update. Dont buy this mobile. Not good for average users also. If you return this product also amazon will not come to pick it up.

"
"

  Its budget friendly technology enabled smart phone. The performance is excellent and battery life is good. Camera is exceptionally well and feature are very useful. I got through Amazon exchange and the exchange price is fairly high. Recommended for regular use..

"
"

  I bought this mobile 2 months back and it's display got damaged atomically

"
"

  Found package without slim plastic coating that comes on mobile box... May be i Don't know but it is used mobile... Once i will check it i will make a complaint against this

"
"

  Awesome product in this price. Very happy! Will recommend to go for this and out of China product.

"
"

  The battery life is superb as it has a very good charge dissipation rate, increasing the duration of a single-use without charging. Also, the camera has a lot of features that have its own purpose and I've personally liked the live-focus and the wide-angle mode.

"
"

  M21 look is awesome and battery  backup is  excellent but when you play  pubg in 4GB variant it takes time to load, so I will suggest you to buy 6GB variant  if you want it for gaming  purpose  though exynos  9611 is a good medium range  processor.

"
"

  I am a big fan of Samsung mobiles and I always buy only Samsung phones.I like Samsung's camera quality the most..and this mobile is same as expected ..advance and best version for me to take pictures and for battery life it is also very long..Thank you Samsung

"
"

  I expect t everything on the pack g, but didn't get ear phone on the pack .

"
"

  It took 3 hours to charge the battery from 58% to 100%.When I looked for complain about this after a month it does not show any option to complain.Very bad experience with this phone and specially with #AMAZON.I recoment not buy anything from Amazon.

"
"

  This phone is masterpiece at this price. The quality of images and video it produce on screen is speechless. Screen produces true black color. And speaking of battery one full charge goes for one and half day straight.

"
"

  Worst experience with samsung mobile got hang 4 times a day regularly after 3 month of use and switching off automatically after hang. Processor is not as expected. Camera is very good. Charging speed not working properly. Sometimes take more than 4 hrs to full charge.

"
"

  This probably the best samsung M series phone.... somehow in a cheaper price...  I used M30 however M21 outclasses M30. Good job Samsung and Amazon. The phone is too good at this price much better than other 20k phones.

"
"

  Samsung always has a surprise..very compact design mobile fits in hand, feels premium, camera superb at the price, fingerprint reader very responsive, Display is practically magnificent, I must say thus phone is best of all in this budget

"
"

  I am really regretting over my decision of purchasing the Samsung M21. Upon charging or using it for a while the phone heats up and also the screen hangs. I have made a video and took a few screenshots to prove the point that the screen hangs.I want to return the item.

"
"

  Network issueI have airtel & jio sim both 4g sims network not working very slow connection.Voice quality is good.Please solve these issues.

"
"

  One of the best choice under 15kOP!! battery 6000 MAHCamera is niceSensor is fast*Not a China product*Display is too OP!!!!Face recognition is also goodBack design is in Samsung style very classic

"
"

  Best Buy in such price. All rounder in features in compact phone. I am very satisfied with the mobile. Must purchased it. Preferred 128gb varient. You can see the attached photo s for camera result.

"
"

  Heating is the main point which we found in the phone and forced to return/as there was only replacement policy, if the same problem is found in replacement piece it would be troublesome.  Company must have return policy otherwise faith of customer would be shaken

"
"

  Gifted my mother on her birthday,she's very happy.She watches videos on this phone the amoled panel is truly marvelous,it easily lasts almost 2days on a single charge,in this budget I have nothing to complain about.My mother is very satisfied with this product.

"
"

  Today I received the Samsung galaxy m21 but after unboxing it I found its already been used by someone beacuse several apps are installed in the phone excluding system apps and the apps which samsung provide. So be careful. Apart from these everything is fine

"
"

  before one year ago i was brought mi phone but still i am not happy to  mi note 7 pro it was really waste of money  so much issue camera stop automatically,phone hang,heating problem etc,now its full fill my requirement without any issue really thank to you Samsung  :)

"
"

  Excellent camera quality, never ending battery life and intelligence of display in addition with made in India feeling of SAMSUNG. It's a great mobile which fulfill al needs.I Highly Recommended this phone üòäüòä

"
"

  Waste of money.... Within 3 months had a charging issues, after servicing also facing the same problem.... There is no proper response at service center as well no proper service... Charging issues... Battery life issues... Sensor issues...

"
"

  fingerprint reader is gudBatter life is superb....but slow charge take 3 hour for fully chargeCamara quality is pitty gud ..Display is also very gudOverall  all gud mobile at this price ....Charging very slow

"
"

  Product is good . Handling , scree touch, screen lock , battery life , camera all things in this price range is amazing. I am handling this product from past 3 months. I working so good and smooth. If you wanna buy it then just go for it.

"
"

  I am using m21 4/64 for last 1 monthOverall very good mobileCamera,touch, display very goodLightweight compared to other5000mah mobiles eventhough its 6000mahOnly negative is its over heating  while using net

"
"

  Budget friendly samsung device with good battery. I got it for RS15999. Because of the plastic back it attracts scractches and dust so suggest you to buy a back cover with the device. Also its hard to find thia device in the retail outlets. Cheers

"
"

  Stopped working after 3 weeks, now running after service centers which already have a million faulty phones in queue!!

"
"

  Delivered someone used phone, not expected this from Amazon. Touch is not working as expected, performance is slow and camera picture quality is good.

"
"

  Excellent phone in this price in samsung 6 gb ram and 128 gb rom. Mainly highlight is camara quality its a amazing 48 mb superb clarity. Phone usage is very interesting superb. In setting lot off optionsFinally I'm giving rating of 5

"
"

  This is a good quality mobile under this budget. Battery life,  camera quality,  display and network quality is pretty good..All over look much better..

"
"

  Preety good feel in hand. Camera is spot on. Battery life is too nice, goes 3 days without charging. 6000mah battery gives a loong battery life. Ordered the 128 gb, 6 gb ram version, so far so good. Satisfied with the purchase.

"
"

  Finger print & face unlock is very fast, battery life is in case most use even 30% remaining ,minor use then battery last 2 days ,camera quality is good both front and back camera and battery 6000mAh but mobile slim and light weight and looking good

"
"

  This phone is good for daily use .....this phone battery is very good, no doubt about it...and phone camera is minimal...if you purchase this phone you will get basic gaming performance.....because you have to remember this phone specs and price....

"
"

  There is no separare folder for privacy files  and no inbuilt app encryption. This is to minus in this mobile battery life is sprb but it not useful gaming  for pub g players.. No inbuilt Music player ..anyway mobile was spr but I expect more features in this mobile....To...

"
"

  ¬†Those who say that exynos is bad and all i would like to suggest them to try this phone.It is so well optimised and the oneui 2.0 is very smooth it is perfect for medium gaming guys no heating issue battery is perfect

"
"

  Good product value for money..Samsung offers great amoled displays.camera is good in day light condition..battery life is awesome..one ui is very cool and unique..ram management is good but available ram is low in 4GB varient better to take 6 GB varient ..

"
"

  Review after 10 days use.Camera is awesome ,5/5 .Take more time to charge , but it is considerable because of 6000 mah and battery performance is nice .Display is super.You can go for it.

"
"

  Mobile Hotspot is not connecting with the LaptopWhile watching YouTube videos/Any movies it will automatically goes off & restarts after 20 to 30 mins continues to watch&I'm looking for Exchange. Pls help me to findout another one.

"
"

  After using it for 1 month I figured out that this set of mobile is best in this range having all features required with good fingerprint sensor and high camera quality . Some special fun features are also available so overall it performs good on the table .

"
"

  ¬†Poor network connectivity, fingerprint sensor is not properly respond.

"
"

  Multi use multi purpose device....it can also be used for pressing ur dresses...it has an in built ironbox which is suitable for pressing all kind of ur daily needs....

"
"

  It takes forever to charge the phoneCamera doesn't feel like 48mpI am not too impressed with the phone and might have to change it soon.

"
"

  Due to plastic body, it easily catch scratches, otherwise good phone to have. One thing also i want to add is that its camera needs little more improvements in video recording and hdr mode in front facing camera.

"
"

  This phone is budgetry. Camera quality is good. Battery back up is superb. I used 12 hour regular watching videos on youtube and listing audio. Till the end battery remains 40 % charged. So go for it and avoid chinease product.

"
"

  Just wow!

"
"

  Best Phone Best Choice.Very Good Collection and Selection.Thanks Amazon.

"
"

  Best mobile in that price range and works good especially battery life made me more love towards it and camera works like anything else, user friendly and easy to operate.Value for money, this is an honest review trust me.

"
"

  Best phone for the budget, android 10 , camera is good with  amoled display is a good combination for a budget mid range phone  , delivery was 2 days earlier than expected

  Nice but some cons are1. It takes little longer time for charge fully2. Too much advertisements3. Some file when download are deleted automatically4. Audios sound little low5. No head phone are given with box.6.

"
"

  ALL FUNCTION IS GOOD, BUT BACK CAMERA IN POOR, PICTURE QUALITY VERY POOR, IMAGES NOT CLEAR.SO I REQUEST PLS. IMPROVE CAMERA QUALITY. 48MP CAMERA IS POOR.

"
"

  Firstly whats app was not download after factory set it started downloading then while watching if you get call the volume goes down. And until you restart phone youtube doesn't play high volume. Sometimes getting stuck while going back.

"
"

  The display stopped working in just 1 month without any physical damage, No resolution from customer support. Asking for an additional amount 5400/- for display replacement under the warranty period.Worst service, bad product

"
"

  Its awsome .......mainly the battery power.....if you are a normal daily user and don't play games as much the battery will goes on for 3-4 days easily......its a great mobile ........samsung I loved the phone.....what a phone it is.....

  M21 is a least priced mobile having beast Exynos 9611 octaocre processor, it has same features as samsung M30s but at low cost, along with monster 6000 mah battery, one good thing about of M21 is low SAR value.

  Bought my first mobile with 48 MP camera after using old models with bad cameras, and I am impressed. Battery life is excellent and wonderful display.  Definitely recommend if you want a mobile with long life compared to other Chinese brands.

  Nise phone by samsung.Desine is nise but not good for this segment.avarage perfomence.play all trending games by normal settings.i priffer 6gb ram for better user experiance.

"
"

  Slow charging.

"
"

  6 GB,  128 GB BlackAll are OK,  except battery.  For an average user,  battery will last for only one day.  M30s,  with  same 6000 mah (4 GB,  64 GB variant)  will last almost 2-days for the same average user.

"
"

  Best Mobile in this budget.Battery life is superb. C Type Fast Charging gives you a feeling of high range Phones. Camera quality is also very good.Fingerprint reader works perfectly and very quickly.I'm totally satisfied by purchasing this phone.

"
"

  Liked the big screen and battery. Faster delivery and some gift would have great

"
"

  awesome product worth purchacing this itemafter some research only i bought this productafter long use of redmi phones this phone does make a differencebut though price can be little lesser i bought it for 13,999

"
"

  Pathetic product and return policy of Amazon. Came with a scratchy back panel, 1 of the sim slots not working, doesn't have 4g sim support, hence not reading Jio sim card. Amazon has refused to change it with another model. üëé

"
"

  This phone is value for money. Compared to same range Relame and other company phone, Samsung is better and reliable brand.Even if we compare to Samsung M31s, M21 is more value for money. Have almost same configurations.

"
"

  I think they have provided the used product . It's been only 2 months I have bought the phone. And it's getting switch off automatically in every 5-10 mints. I have no idea what to do . I think I'll rather buy electronic products offline in future.

"
"

  Just awesome.Camera quality and Battery life is just perfect.Bought it for my mother..She is very happy.I am satisfied with the product..Thanks Amazon india.And moreover this is not a Chinese Product.#boycott_chinese_product

"
"

  Camera quality is just average,not good quality snaps from a 48 mp rear camera.Even the front camera is also Very Very average.Picture quality very poor.Dont know about battery as the device is new.Finger printer quality ok.

"
"

  Over All Good Phone, It hangs like once in a week due to over use, but over all good phoneI kinda hate some of minor features which are not available like Internet speed showing on Notification bar and We Can't turn off vibration of Menu keys

"
"

  Its a very good phone from a reputed brand. It has all the essential features that are required by anyone. So I can safely say its a good alternative to Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo etc as they dent on your reputation.

"
"

  Good quality camera and good battery life,the fingerprint reader works fine.Overall good phone.

"
"

  Such as a much better in low bought, its so beutifull in acsessing by nature and totally value of money...I hardly recommended it to buy in low budget phone..

"
"

  I like this mobile handset. All features are good quality. It's as we expect. We ordered one more same handset

"
"

  Screen got damaged ,pink patches appered on displayWhen I went to Samsung service centre they asked almost half price if this product to change the displayThink how much Samsung making money after market

"
"

  The phone is ok, it hangs many times and has to be shut down or has to be restarted by long pressing start button. This is especially if there are more apps running and the phone is locked. Tried to reach samsung customer care ,  but could not get connected

"
"

  The phone is awesome....but the only problem  I have faced that it hai manufacturer  defect....there was little gap between  screen and phone body....at the down corner.....

"
"

  Very poor product, battery drainage problem, network problem.Service by amazon is very poor.No replacement in7 days.Technician declined to replace the phone.TOTALLY I WANT TO SAY THAT NO PRODUCT SHOULD BE BUY FROM AMAZON.

"
"

  I dont think so it is worth 14000 rupees it is worth 12700 rupees or 13000 rupees

"
"

  It is a good product. Battery works for more than a day for a normal user (games, social media, productivity). UI is easy to use. Display is very good and fits in the hand perfectly fine. Overall it is a good phone.

"
"

  Battery last long because it has 6000 mAh battery.You can pubg in HD without lag. Good display. Fingerprint is very good. The best thing I like is camera quality. Just sometime if you use mobile 4-5 hours it hangs a little. But anyway I like this mobile.

"
"

  Worst mobile I have ever purchased. It started hanging within 15 days of of purchase. After clicking picture sometime you will get completely black picture. Overheating. I will never recommend to purchase.

"
"

  If you are not a pro gammerThen this is the phone for you1.I rate camera except front camera as one of the best among today's phone2. Battery no doubt is plus with3. excellent display screen quality4. Good finger sensor.

"
"

  Battery life doesn't seem to be like 6000mAh. It lasts only 1 day. Redmi phones with 4000mAh lasts for 1.5 days.

"
"

  Being A samsung user In Middle Range I have chosen the best mobile Samsung M21 and Everything is fine If the Charger rope would be longer then it will be better and finally I am happy with my Decision and am Loving my phone samsung m21 . Thankyou samsung.üòä

"
"

  Product just now recd., after using the phone we can express or review about fingerprint reader, battery life and camera quality. We are very happy, if they give ear phones, tempered glass and back cover along with this product because the product cost more than Rs.10,000/-

"
"

  Great sound quality- Dolby audio and great picture quality for all kinds of pictures. Decent battery life- Almost one day battery life with heavy usage. I gifted it to my parents as the brand and quality were something I didn't want to go back on.

"
"

  Super Amoled Display Really Awesome. Super Camera Quality. But 6000 mAh battery, Slightly not upto the Mark. Normal Usage it comes 1 day, Heavy Usage it doesn't come 1 day..Overall Value for Money #AvoidChineseBrand #SamsungGreat

"
"

  Best mobile i ever had.. best mobile at this price.. with fast charging and best camera quality.. sure you can buy it..

"
"

  Net not working properly

"
"

  A very good mobile. Using since I bought it. In Samsung mobiles some times, touch screen pose problems. They have to improve this aspect. Other wise it's very good.

"
"

  Amazing

"
"

  At present mobile is working excellent detailed review after two months use.

"
"

  Battery  back up, camera quality is  very good  ...Need to work on the network settings the signal strength need to be week when in comparison  with other Samsung  phones.  Need to improve on the signal both Mobile and hotspot

"
"

  ¬†I was wondered about this phone after buying it.I am really very satisfied by this smartphone. Everything is perfect.Charges very fast than I expected. Camera quality is awesome.Perfomance is very good. Display is also better.

"
"

  At present i must say Samsung smartphones are best in the market. Look 6GB ram with 128GB ROM & 6000mah battery with 48megapixel camera in just 15k ruppees. unbelievable deal i want to say thank u to Samsung for this phone i m too happy experiencing this wonderful gazette.

"
"

  never buy this phone. after 1/5 months it seems a big display problem. the display is blinking. and the set is going slow. having a lot of touching problems. the set has automatically turned off.

"
"

  Best alternative for Chinese mobile phones.samsung is best after sell service and quality of the m21 camera and display is fabulous.and battery life is awasome9/10 hr heavy usage.but you are gamer this phone is not for you.

"
"

  Internet reception is poor, cannot pickup poor signal when compared with Infinix, Lenovo and vivo when kept all together at the same location. This mobile only work on strong signal area

"
"

  Nice phone for average daily use. Security features like fingerprint reader and face unlock are fast and accurate. Battery life is main highlight. Camera quality is better than its competitors in the price range 12-15 k. Overall a very good choice.

"
"

  ¬†Worst Camera I came across. It's 48 MP image quality is even poorer than 8 MP. Refer the video shot taken from tripple Camera with main Camera being 48 MP. Disappointed completely..this wasn't expected from Samsung.

"
"

  Hi team I have purchase new phone from. Amazon but mobile apps not updated and new apps not installed pls.help if any settingAnd phone heating proble.

"
"

  This mobile is really very bad don't buy it please very very bad .....!!!!

"
"

  This is perfect for my use, the touch is good so is the battery life. I have been using multiple screens and multitasking and this has worked really good for me. I am pretty impressed with the fast charger as well.

"
"

  I have been using this monster of a phone almost a month now and I'm extremely happy with it. Be it the audio quality, video quality the camera results or the battery backup. All are simply incredible. Look of the phone is also nice.

"
"

  It takes to much time to charge the phone and you said it supports fast charging.

"
"

  Overall good product nad value for money. Camera disappoints with specs as 48 MP. I also have Redmi 7S with 48 MP camera and captures awesome images. Samsung camera lags here.

"
"

  Phone has poor network reception which causes damn slow internet.Please think twice before buying ....no return policy ...exchange or replacement Within 7 day‚Äôs and later it‚Äôs your headache to contact Samsung for any issue.

"
"

  After using 5 days i am really impress by samsung m21 model , really good , i am having 6gb and 128 gb storage , totally impressive . Having long battery life and good camera. Fast to use and awesome  look which u r craving for. Must buy. Good to buy in 15 k

"
"

  Nice product by Samsung, but There should be an earphone with this mid Range phone. Gorilla glass should be upgraded,Back panel is made up of plastic. I think it should be of  Glass.If you are competing with Chinese ,you should improve yourself.

"
"

  Battery life is great...but it takes a lot time to Charge...Camera Quality is Good of both front and back...but it has only 4x zoom power...otherwise it's a ""Very Nice"" phone...but you should Add some more colour choices...

"
"

  Super battery pack up , crisp shots in 48MP and super wide angle shots in 8MP camera, amazing 20MP front camera , lag free performance with elegant one UI , amazing s-Amoled display in dark mode , loud main spearkers , low sar value and super build quality üíØ

"
"

"
"
