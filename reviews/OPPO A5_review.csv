  Brought this phone for my wife who is die hard fan for oppo...Offer like 2000 extra off on exchange with Oppo is just like waww....So after exchange of her old oppo mobile I got this phone for just Rs.6800.... Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...Pros.1) good features considering cost 6800.2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt3) Speakers are good Dolby4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones...5) Quad camera gives good quality photos...6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 68007) 5000mAh battery8) can be use as power bank for other phonesCons:1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so...2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...This is all about this phone after 24hrs use....I will update if something comes...

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,Review score (out of 5)Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor)Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours)Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is availablePros : apart from above mentioned points :1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung)2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly4)face detection is fast5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal usesCons:1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro4) no fast charger with pack

  Oppo makes very nice phone at this price range about quad cameras but we have another option to select Realme smartphones which is comparatively low budget and good cameras...But this phone I like mostly in battery back up with type C charger.. and also like camera clearity because I have already attached some snaps here from my Oppo A5 2020...Overall good performance of this phone and speaker was nice sounds which is have dual atmos..Thanks Oppo

  Lowest speed ever seen in android and charger not support to battery. It will be 3 hours to take full charge

"
"

  The first thing is slow charging of this mobile taking more than 3 hours for full charging.  My friend bought the same mobile but that was 4 gb ram and 64 gb rom in which he got hand free but my mobile was 3 gb ram and 64 rom in which they are not providing hand free. Why?

  Its Camera gives pictures .. like .keypad mobile who has vga camera very poor in camera u get redish images i have never seen such worst device it often get stuck in between apps .. evn u dnt have pubg like games in ur device still it get stuck in usual apps .. it is better to buy a keypad mobile .rather than oppo a5 2020 struggled a lot with this device .. finally got returned thank god ... I truely suggest u people out there . Do not waste your money in buying this device

  It's a nice phone , quite heavy that might be due to it's 5000mah battery. Gaaming is awesome , camera is not upto the mark, quad camera is just locha, night mode doesn't satisfy you,And the most important thing it lacks is the LED NOTIFICATION LIGHT it's a must and seeing it's price (13k) notification light must have arranged,I bought this phone in exchange don't buy it without exchange because you can get a much better phone in this price . nest with exchange

  OPPO A5: This is faulty product selling by Amazon. and they have shake hand with the the agent to fool customer.The camera quality of this mobile is worst and regarding this on 3rd day itself i wanted to return the product but Amazon has denied it saying its not their fault and product is not manufactured by them. But if the product is not manufactured by them and the product is faulty then they shall take return of the product and should return my money back. But Amazon executive is not taking the request of return for this product. this is straight away fooling the customer by Amazon.

"

   So the mobile was delivered to me on 20July,20 & the fingerprint scanner stopped working on 11Aug,20 ie less than a month ai it's within one month of purchase the scanner stopped working & if anyone is concerned I have already tried hard reset, soft reset of the handset but the scanner never worked as you can see in the video attached moreover they are still installing the bloatware eg helo app (as seen in the screen shot) which have been BANNED... by the Indian Government.. its not a small issue.. as they are still not working for the safety of there Indian customer... Thus never going to recommend a oppo mobile to anyone not even entry level & just forget about the high-end series...

  It's a great product to have in this price range. Very sturdy design and comes with very good quality back cover. It really protect the phone when falls down.Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently.Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day.Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all.I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product. It has blue light filters do saves your child's eye sights.

  Pros - 1. Battery life is Excellent.  2. Feels nice in the hand & looks stunning.  3. Stereo Speaker gives a great experience.  4. Snapdragon 665 is decent for normal users, good for casual games but not for heavy games.  5. Has widevine L1 Certification, so u can stream Netflix, Amazon Prime In FHD.  6. Has Usb Type C, nice to have this.Cons - 1. Display is 720p, not a good display.  2. Doesn't support fast charging.  3. Cameras are too bad, for normal pictures it's also not good, don't even think about good shots.  4. Storage speed is slow, ram management is very poor.  5. Color os is not properly optimized.Extras - Fingerprint is good, supports reverse charging, has dolby atmos support,has gorilla glass 3, max brightness is quite good.

  I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user.one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that.but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming

  I bought this Phone and used 48 hr . Here I am sharing my review about this PhoneProns1.value for money2.Battery back-up is very good in normal usages3.rear camera is decent but need to improve4.selfie camera is very good compared to other phones5.Display is Decent only.6.inbuild tempered glass and transparent backcover is excellent quallity7.Dolby Atmos speaker's are excellent8.No heating issues on wifi Cons1.Power Adaptor (charger) is made in china.company itself says product is made in India and I don't know why they give china charger2.No Fast charging option.it takes 3hr minimum to 0 to 1003.There is no Led Notification indicator. This is the biggest drawbacks of this Phone because even 3000 rs phones comes with led notification indicator

  I exchanged this for my Redmi Note 4. All said and done, I think, I shouldn't have. The Redmi Note (4 or any other version since) is superior in every way - scores over the Oppo in both departments  - hardware and software. I would have bought the new Redmi 9 but it wasn't available for exchange and I wasn't about to pay 4000 more. Besides there is the Redmi 9 and then there is a Redmi Note 9 and both offerings use the Mediatek processor, this time over, if I am not mistaken, instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon, and it is early days yet - with the reviews. They say some flavors of the Mediatek are doing as well as the Qualcomm Snapdragon, but I can't be sure and you might want to look up the data on that elsewhere - say NDTV gadgets or some such site.The Oppo's operating system ""Color OS"" sucks big time. Among other annoyances the most visible / obvious ones are : you don't get that slider to get past the screen saver, and you have to punch in your security numbers every time - which is a bit of a pain and also they want you to pay them anything in between 24 to a couple of hundred bucks for a new theme, which you can get on other phones for free (or at least I did with Redmi). Who in their right mind will pay for kitschy wallpaper and cheap fonts from when windows was launched in 1985 (you know the type that was included in all kinds of ""banner"" software and then made it's way into software like wordstar? that). Also, from day one, the ""assistive ball"" is missing for me. I would use the assistive ball to take screenshots or the one-touch turn off display button. I tried to reach oppo customer service about it. try as I might, i couldn't call them and then I found an email id and tried to write to them, but they didn't have an answer either. The best they could do is ask me to reset the OS all over again - which of course I am not going to do. It would mean downloading and installing all the apps again. And if it still doesn't correct the problem, I'd have lost all that valuable bandwidth for nothing. Also, it would reset some of the bloatware I got rid off, so painstakingly.  I can always use the system one touch turn off display icon from the tray. But shiver me timbers! if I ever need to reach them about a genuine SOS kinda issue, then what?!The other thing that you miss when moving from the Redmi to this one is the Redmi OS's ""Second Space"" feature. The dual device mode (not the same as dual apps). It's like you have a laptop / PC with two operating systems to choose from only you can switch from one to the other when your phone is still on - fully booted up and while working on one OS. Like an alt + tab on the PC, switch from one ""space"" to the other and back again. Talk to the wife on the one end and exchange whatsapp with the girlfriend on the other (kidding. have neither a wife or a girlfriend! but think about those who do! what fun! yeah? they made a phone for adulterers!).I tried to take a picture of the full moon at night the other evening, and all I got was white light in the frame! Now, the thing has four cameras, with goodness knows how many megapixels and it's been a while since smartphones have been at it - so, you'd think they might have the whole point-and-shoot thing in the bag, wouldn't you? At least don't dissolve a perfectly round moon into Jesus' second coming! Elsewhere I read, the OPPO isn't what you use for night photography, but it takes okay enough pictures during the day. But that's like shortchanging you 50 percent on the cameras. It's like they punched in four holes in the thing and stuck in a few lenses that don't do nothing ever for you, like a cheap Rolex knock-off that sits there on your wrist, but won't tell the time.  I don't use the camera, so I won't complain, but you don't want to buy the Oppo to take pictures then.I had a good mind of returning it and get my money back before the window closes but I don't want to go through the hassle all over again (of buying another phone). It works and I am able to use it to connect to the internet. I can only hope that the thing does not develop any snags going ahead and at least lasts me a few years before I can afford to buy me another phone!so, yeah. underwhelmed. but on the plus side, i knocked Rs. 3500/- off of the marked price, got me a little more space (the old Redmi had 32GB and this one has 64, not that it makes a difference to me. A good chunk is taken away by the OS and leaves about 40 GB available to me for my apps, audio and ebooks) , and also I got me 4gb of RAM. That's a GB more and the good thing about that is I don't have to start the Amazon app again every time I go away googling for the answers to the Amazon quiz. (what? so I cheat! it's not like I have won anything ever or am ever gonna win anything anyway!)

  1. No wifi calling right out of the box but once you update it you get WiFi calling .2. Phone is heavy : my hands literally start to pain after few hours of use. Mainly chat.3. Battery, display, camera is all fine. For this price range.4. My biggest disappointment is weight.5. After 4 months phone started getting hang sometime. Not too much but still.

  Camera quality poor mob gets hot while playing game

  This phone is too good in battery life. If you like music there is awesome Dolby atmos system. Good fone in budget. Camera performance is also excellent in this budget category. Performance and Display is also good. You can play pubg without any lag and with excellent battery backup.Overall, good phone in this category

"
"

  Best if you get it under 10k. I got it on sale + exchange so the deal was fine for me.Display 3.5/5Camera 2.5/5Battery 5/5Charging 3/5Performance 3.5/5No headsets for 3gb variant🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️Fingerfrint is fast. I don't use face unlock. SD665 is great budget chipset. Updated to Android 10 but color os is just meh. I mean out for 3gb ram it uses 1.5gb, with some permanent services you are left with 1gb free memory. Bought it for my parents so no big deal as they are not heavy users but if you are a heavy user, either don't buy color os phone or atleast go for 4gb variants.

"

  So I bought this phone for my dad.Pricing is a bit high even for 3GB version. However I got it at 9,400 on sale so a pretty good deal.Pros:1. Big screen2. Widevine L1 certification3. Stereo speakers which are quite loud and great for such a cheap phone4. Dolby Atmos5. Two usable cameras incl. Ultra Wide6. 5000mah battery with type C charging (again quite rare at this price point)7. Android 10 update (rare for entry level phones)Cons:1. Ultra wide camera is lackluster2. 10watt charging support only3. L1 certification is only for show as Netflix and Prime do not support the phone for HD streamingIf you are getting it sale then it is quite a good phone, but if not on sale then there are better options out there from Samsung, Realme and Redmi.

  First impressions - Beautiful ! Design and build - full marks..This is my first Oppo experience. Bought it as a gift for a near one.It has all that you need! I haven't enabled the finger print sensor as its not needed as yet. Touch is as responsive as my OnePlus 6T I use.  Its just 2 days of use. Its just the perfect blend of features and great specs it already has. No lag whatsoever and this is the 3 GB version. No bloatware.What more can one want ? Overall Excellent VFM !

  I had never thought I would go for this phone.I had thought to buy redmi note 9 which went out of stock and I needed a phone urgently.Then finally I had to buy this. It is really amazing. I was not having good opinion about this phone , but its AMAZING.Camera: The rear camera performnace is realy amazing at this price point. Front camera performance is above average. I wouldnt recommend selfie lovers.The video stabalisation of rare camera is like other phone in price segmant like redmi note 8.Battery: The battery is the beast . It lasts a day smoothly after heavy use and may even remiain after that.Performance: Its good . I wouldnt say its bestBut redmi note 9/note 8 is better in smoothness if compared. But its smooth.Pros(my point of view):1. Camera is outstanding for the price2. Speakers are extra loud and have good quality3. Screen is really large and colours pop out amazingly4. Fingerprint and face unlock are like flagship phones5. Design feels rich6. Phone feels light in handCons:1. Front camera could be improved2.the speed of scrolling is a bit slow( Im not sure, i guess it can be fixed through settings)3. Camera app could have more features like night mode

  I am a normal phone user, so dont  like to play game in Phone and waste time.But want to give a honest review1) I have taken White colour Phone and its really looking great. I will suggest dont go for Black.2) Camera Is good total 4+1 Lense are there , Selfie is also good but not up to the mark. but back camera is very good . We should expect DSLR quality from Phone camera so My rating is 4.3) Charging is quite good and fast .4) Company is providing back cover and earphone so it saves Rs.500/- Earphone sound is very good and soft.5) Finger Sensor rating is 46) Using since 24 Hours and not fell any lagging. Installed my Office application and its quit good and Fast.7) Better than MI (Xiomi) because now these days MI comes in Sale and in few minutes it will finish , but I would recommend  for this no need to wait for sale and quite a good phone in this 12000/- range.8) Delivery took less than 24 hours and I am not a prime member- Credit goes to Amazon.Cons1) Ring tone is little bit low

"

  Its camera quality is very very bad..Problems which i am facing are-1. Heating issue2. unusual battery draining3. 3.5 mm port defective. There are so many smartphones available in this price segment..so please don't waste your money

"
"

  This phone has one of the best dual speakers available in the market, its loud and clear with dolby atmos.Display is 720 p but its bright and overall picture quality and sound effects are amazing.Processor sd 665 is nice too, you can play pub g and most of the heavy games on it with medium to high settings.Call quality, wifi receiver and every other aspect of this phone is nice for this budget. of 10 to 11 K.Whats not good with this phone is - battery Charging time !!!!!!! it takes 3hrs to charge from 0 to 100 with 10 watt charger. Discharge of battrey is good because of 11nm chipset so kinda helps in number of times you will charge.Canera quality is ok, not the best but does justice to the price.Definitely recommend it to others if you dont mind 2-3 hrs charging time.

"
"

  The phone is good but in 2020 you can get a better spec with the same budget. It can be any other Oppo or any other brand. But it won't disappoint you. The only bad is it's camera. Not that much good if you are a photoholic person. Otherwise it will satisfy you in every other aspect. Be it battery life or display or sound quality. No heating issue. Fingerprint sensor is excellent. Overall 3.5 star.

  If u want to buy a good phone in same price range ....check out others company products...it's almost gud but little costly and there is greater issue about system update...when u update , update complete upto 100% after using lot of internet..but phone not get updated & features remain same as before it is....It always give notification of new update is available...I tried to get rid of this issue but it is in vain..and no any earphone is available with this phone..I m just suggesting, if you are oppo lover then go for it only with exachange of mobile due to it costs u less, else I recommend not to buy the phone due to its issues with more cost...

  The phone is good in terms of battery life and memory only. Rest nothing is good about it. I received this on 13th August and writing review on 20th August. Here are the issues:1. The camera is very poor. It has too much noise and picture quality isn't good.2. This phone doesn't support direct video calls. That's pathetic.3. Phone gets heat up and the charger heats up more than that. I've shared a screenshot of 43°C but I've noticed the temperature going 45°C. If you are using online meeting apps like zoom, ms teams or Google meet, the heating is little faster. The worse part is that it gets up heated while calling which makes it highly uncomfortable to talk and even hold in hands.4. Whatsapp notifications stuck on the screen for few seconds while watching online videos.5. You can't see YouTube videos more than 480p, sometimes a few videos stream at 720p. Same videos run at 1080p on other devices.6. The customer care executives aren't able to understand the problem. I've called 5 times since Sunday but they conduct and suggest the same solution for better performance of the phone but no improvements have been noticed. Yesterday I was convinced that Amazon has registered the problem and will get back to me but I'm waiting since yesterday afternoon and my query hasn't come yet.7. Amazon fools you. It decreased its prices on 6-7 August for sale. I was happy that this product is available at a lower price but the decreased price has become fixed now. So whenever you see a sale, always buy electronic products after the sale is over and don't become a fool. I bought this item based on my friends recommendations (since I needed a phone urgently for my work) but I'm done buying any electronic products from Amazon.

  Oppo A5 2020 is good enough as per budget but operating system needs to be little more upgraded. Phone app/calling app is not user friendly.  It is same like redmi phone app. And gallery media files are arranged in a reverse dated rows means you will find media files like pics/videos from current dates at the bottom and very old dated at the top which is not convenient.  Rest all is fine.

"
"

  The phone built quality seems good with good finishing. Has a good camera. Audio quality is good. But the screen size is large and can be uncomfortable while riding a bike. Also, the audio jack is on the bottom side,so if you are an avid music listener the cable could bend a lot. For the price I paid I am very happy with the product as I have found the camera and the audio very good. The screen resolution could have been better though for the size of the screen used. Have shared few images shot on the phone. The video stabilisation also seems to be good.  Overall its a very good phone.

  I purchased this device for my father, who's priority is whatsapp and YouTube only with some step counting and calories burning counting apps. For that purpose this device is fine. But as it's having sd 665 ai processor I tested it with gameplay of freefire in low settings and device got hanged, with unbearable fluctuating FPS. I changed certain settings in developer options to make more ram free and bang performance of gaming improved drastically. This simply means this device has bad ram management and it really needs to ne worked out. I would suggest if you bare planning to buy this device with multitasking and gaming in mind than think twice, otherwise it's Ok to go for it.

  I purchased this phone only for Vowifi  calling as call drop was the major concern that too from all network provider in my lane and conditions worsens after entering the house. But Vowifi works inside also... So I purchased it for vowifi. Firstly I got annoyed as I didn't find the vowifi feature (though i checked in internet before purchasing) . But then there was a catch that only oppo 2020 having Color OS 7 have this feature and upgrades will be available for phones having build version ending with 48 and 51. This I came to know from Oppo customer care. Thankfully my phone was in list of updated ones and after updating it serves the purpose. Now I can make and receive calls even inside house. Weight Slightly on higher side but touch and camera are gud.

  I have been using phone almost one month. I am satisfied. This phone is more good that what I have expected. Starting with camera ,it is only a average camera not bad but has 4k video recording. Battery life is excellent. I am getting 11 plus hours ON screen usage. Then the most good part of the phone is it's speakers and finger print scanner. Screen is not full hd only 720p but it's good . Phones design is perfect. In my usage of 1 month I haven't felt any lag even when I played Pubg. I can't find any dark mode on this phone. In my first impression the phone was a bit heavy. But after usng it I am used to it. Overall a good phone for day to day use.

"

  Guyzz, phone is good with all it's features and under this budget.As per Amazon app, the box will have headset along with other accessories, when I purchased one, found that headset is missing so I went for replacement. Even the replacement box doesn't have headset.Think twice

"
"

  Phone is good at the price point camera is good battery life 2 days if you not using heavy gaming , but i sugeest to amazon the that delivery person had no manners to talk with coustemers specially with girls i oderd for my sister and she called me and said very bad beahviour done by courir boy☹️☹️☹️

"
"

  Phone design look pretty cool and battery backup is amazing. Camera is decent but I'm not that  kind of  person who takes different, different, types of photos.If compare to price Oppo A5 2020 is expensive, I got the device at 13,990 rupees ( 4GB/64GB). At this price point they should give FHD+ display & fast charging, compare to competition.

"
"

  At price of rs 12000 it’s very poor in terms of its1touch screen. U need to press little hard on screen.2 fast charging option is missing. Don’t not support fastcharger.3 camera is very poor in its resolution. Chinese product claim just in terms of mega pixels but quality is just in half of the range of its claim.4. Forget about HD+It’s not even HDGood aspects1 screen Size is good2 exchange offer is provided. Which is missing in readmi 9prime . Readmi much better in quality with 2000 less in price.I admit I have made bad choice. Do watch reviews on YouTube.

"
"

  Good mobile . Cam quality is good. Big screen mobile using for movies of prime.And HD vedios. But it's pin is different from others that is so frestative . U can get samsung ate the same cost & better features like cam and battery life. But good . Value of money

"

  I have been using this phone for around two weeks and following are the pros and cons I found of this device:Pros1. Battery life is supperb, the HD plus  screen kind off consumes less power than a Full HD screen and hence battery life with a 5000 mah battery is really good.2. Speaker and sound is absolutely best, dolby atmos is amazing to hear, there are two speakers on this phone.3. Quad cameras, there are four of them in the rear and they take decent photos for this price range.4. Android 10 update with dark mode looks awesome along with colorOS 7 UI.5. Display is very good inspite of being only HD plus display.6. Snapdragon 665 can run most games at medium settings without any problem.Cons1. No fast charge, it will take around 2 hours to fully charge this phone to 100% from 10%.2. Screen resolution should have been Full HD and many of the completitors are offering it at this price.3. Front camera not as good as you would expect despite being 8 mp.

"
"

  Screen -Screen quality is very veryy bad. After 30 minutes of continuously uses i have headache & pain in eye's.Let's talk about the processor -Performance of Snapdragon 665 processor is very bad in this phone even my Redmi note 5 pro which is 2 years old & has Snapdragon 636 processor is perform better in Games especially in PUBG.Camera -Both Cameras are decentGameplay -When i start playing PUBG i experience a huge Lag problem & Continuously frame Drops even in very low Graphics ( So Smooth + Medium ). I wouldn't expect this type of performance.Performance in gaming is very Bad.Other -The pre apllied Screen protector is very bad. It has 0% smoothness.The Sterio Speakers is not that laoud as other smartphone which has Sterio Speakers.Battery -Battery life is ok but not as i expect. But the main problem is charging it takes approximately 2:30 - 3 hours to charge 100%. Charging speed is very slow. If you are in hurry or in emergency belive me this phone is Sucks & get cheated with youDesign -Design is very good but the white colour became dull very easily.Accessories -You get a 10w charger & usb type-C which is of  Poor quality.You only get earphone with 4gb model. with 3 gb model you  can't get earphones.Please Don't wasn't your money Here. Go somewhere else.

"
"

  Good quality display even if its a HD+ display, Color OS 7 is a big improvement over its predecessor, UI is customizable according to your taste, Dependable cameras, Goodness of snapdragon 665, good battery backup enough to last throughout the day, also has type-C charging port.Overall a good buy, recent mobile are always out of stock, however this was a very good alternative and dont regret buying it. Its performance is comparable to recently launched moto g9, nokia 5.3, redmi 9 prime, realme narzo.

"
"

  The phone has a lot of specifications and one of the best phone in this range. The thing which makes it special is its battery and processor. The snapdragon 660 and 5000mah the perfect combination for every normal user. The camera is not good while comparing to the other high end devices but its manageable. Loved this phone it is whole white and looks lavish.

"
"

  So I bought this phone for my Dad. Initially I had a budget of 12k and I was considering to buy Redmi 9 prime but it sells out almost immediately and offline it costs 2k moreAfter a bit of research I found this phone to be relevant and Cheaper.Performance is smooth as it has sd665 and battery life is great considering hd+ and 5000mah battery.Honestly I don't find a great deal of quality difference in terms of screen resolution as I myself use k20 pro which has FHd+ panel.It comes with Android 9 but it can be updated to Oreo in system updatesFew things which you may dislike are:A lot of crap apps some can be uninstalled and others can't.Camera performance (comparing from k20 pro perspective) is very average4 cameras mostly useless Ultrawide can be of a little use thoughFew things I liked arePlastic build is good and I personally liked itComes with a pretty good back case. Which my Dad is using from starting so it saved 200-300 rupeesType C charging is goodSize is great and light weight too

"
"

  Ordered on 26.7.2020Received on 28.7.2020Phone looks Good, considering the price range and when compared to other phones in this segment, it looks simple and elegant.Not a fan of color os.Installed a launcher, atleast to look somewhat like stock android.Display quality is ok.Speakers are awesome ( stereo speakers ).Battery life seems to be sceptical.Will update after a few days

"
"

  This mobile phone Oppo A5 2020 is very good , it has almost all features , the battery running fine , both the cameras are good , display is average , Wi-Fi calling is working fine . Overall the phone is good for this price range , I recommend this phone , great, go for it .....

"
"

  I thought OPPO will be a good choice...But except camera , nothing is good in this phone...The phone is much slower on internet compared to my previous phone....sometimes you hv to wait a lot to open site with high speed internet connection,  while other phones are much faster in same internet speed.Also keypads are problematic. Many a times you press one alphabet isctyped and will found different alphabet is typed..need lot of correction after typing..don't know, why it's happening...not a good phone at all..Don't buy it..

"
"

  Hey Amazon, this time I fell cheated by you, low quality product by oppo, if possible please change the product with other brand,With regardsWaiting for reply,,,,

"
"

  I heard all the negative review but I guess it differs in my case it works well and the camera quality is good. It's definitely value your money.

"
"

  One of worst product ever seen,app cloner(dual app)is present but simultaneously maximum 2 app are use,fast charger is Not present as well as battery service is not good according to instructions by Oppo,Many more problem is present to this phone,I suggest you to not buy this phone at 12000 because there are many more options are available at this price

"
"

  The product is not up to the mark what it commits and says. Also the Product does not come with Ear Phones. Its either they r removed or not given with the Phone. This was 1st and Last time i have bought a phone from Amazon and would not suggest people to buy it from any of the Online site visit a shop and take it as per your preference and seeing the product.

"
"

  The phone is good. But camera quality is very poor. Please oppo sovle ta camera quality by giving us software updates. Price is slightly overpriced. battery of the phone is really noticable. But again camera is not good as described.

"
"

  1. Phones design perfect.2. Fingerprint reader and face unlock is fast.3. Audio quality awesome.4. Lot of required and important features.5. 44GB space present in 64GB.6. Updated to Android 10 also.7. Camera decent enough under 11,000 but there is no nightscape mode choice in camera app in 3GB RAM but captures good picture in dark.8. Processor is also good.9. Battery takes almost 3hr to charge from 0 to 100% but long lasting backup.10. Good for multitasking and multimedia but not for heavy gaming users.11. A great choice under 11,000 but if price more than that than you have lot of other good choices.

"
"

  Not even a month and the phone has problems. Screen is on and finger print reader, volume rocker and power not responding. Screen is unable to respond as well. Screen do not detect any touches. Regretting the purchase and sellers are clever enough to not to include a return more than 1 week from purchase.

"
"

   So good product it supports 4K camera video and photos 720 p full HD and 4k it supports. Battery life is good two day battery life. But for charging full  for 2and half hour it will take.I like it sooooo much after Redmi 7.redmi 7 is not good in privacy and camera.So I buy this phone

"
"

  Hello, This review I am giving after using phn for almost 3 month,1)It is very good phn in this price range,2) it has very good finger print sensor3) its processor is good No lag found till now4) camera is not good but it is ok for this price5) battery life is good but after continuous use or gaming it get hot6) over all this phn is good in this price range compare to redmi, Vivo, samsung

"
"

  first time ordered an OPPO phone. quite impressed by its features and specs. True to its specs, phone is working great, good battery life, looks amazing. I ordered a white white. The best part is that i received a silicon cover and a set of earphones with it included in the cost Rs.11,999/- as these we never get earphones in the box. I like the phone, may be 6 months down the line, i will buy another oppo replacing my xiomi.

"
"

  Very heavy phone, stutters slightly when scrolling and TOO MUCH BLOATWARE! Annoying! If this crap continues in the future I will only buy Android-One or iPhone. It's gotten completely ridiculous. Clean up Oppo!

"
"

  Dont buy any it.. camera blurred or take much attention during selfi.... cheat specs.

"
"

  All Ok with price 10990, But back panel is doesn't look too black it shines a lot with polished glass and lots of possibilities of straches if you are not using back cover then your mobile becomes damn old..... more over oppo occupies a lot of space in internal storage due to themes , software..etc... Over All good and takes upto 3hr charging time quite disappointing for Type C , looks bulky but standard mobile best exchange value ,Lasts up to 3-6years depends upon the user👍

"
"

  GenuinelyIt's useless camera phone even normal photos can't goodHorryble camera front camera 8mp can't capture better than my 2018 model MI y2Also very slow due to 3gb ram.battery good all day backup 5000mAhColour & Display is goodOverall better to go for xiomi at this price pointif you have budget get f series they perform betterHave you get some help.

"
"

  Country of origin is not India.This is made in China phone.

"
"

  Good phone in this price segment, quad cam , big battery, video stabilization, what more can u expect from a budget device.Reviewing after one day of use...Battery - 8/10Camera - 8/10Overall - 8/10No heating till now, works smooth, no lagging, overall a decent phone...

"
"

  It would be a great phone if it have full hd display yes it contains 720p resolution which is old in modelOther spped and hardware is okey for this deviceI have owned Xiaomi mobiles recently so i don't like its software as Xiaomi offers very easy excess to their apps but it doesn't

"
"

  Good value for money. Bought in Amazon big billion sale for my Mom getting good value for an old product and she's totally loving it.I was also looking for Samsung M30s but it doesn't have any screen protection and also it failed in one of the drop test. Moreover there was no good deal for exchanging on the same so had to go with this. And trust me using 1st time oppo, I wouldn't regret it.

"
"

  Fingerprint is slow and the smoothness of the screen is quite slow rest day to day performance is good not good for gaming just a entry level processor still does the basic jobs wellBattery life is amazing almost 8+ hours of sot but very very slow charging due to 10watt don't know if it supports 18 watt or notCamera is decent in lit environment low light quality is below averageSound quality is quite good due to dual speakersRest os is neat and clean no major problems noted

"
"

  I bought it for my Mom, we all know how our mom's use phone. They can easily spend a day or two by just simply looking at forwarded videos of their respective groups and surfing through fb. Hence my focus was to buy a long kasting battery life phone and I am happy to buy this one. Stunning performance, amazing camera. Processor is very fast and responds quickly as per the needs for which it was purchased. A perfect lower mid range phone.

"
"

  Pathetic....This phone doesn't even support normal usage and hangs like anything.Pls don't buy this, as after just 2 month of purchase this phone started lagging for no reason.I'm not a heavy user, neither I play games on ph nor I use heavy apps still this ph hangs.

"
"

  I got this phone from your website on 24th August 2020  it's been 34 days only that I am using it.The issue that I am facing after 10 days of use- it hangs a lotSecondly today on 29th Aug it's display turned out like showing in the pictures with this review.I don't want to go to the service center in this pandemic it's 60kms away from my home.Kindly replace this phone asap.I am hoping for the positive response from you.

"
"

  Excellent mobile phone with great features. Sound is awesome. Zumbo Battery backup but camera is average not better.

"
"

  i bought it with exchange of my old phone, so the price was reasonable for 4gb ram 128gb rom specs with snapdragon processor. few points.... 1. battery charges slowly(around 3hrs for full charge) but runs for more than 1 day with wifi, mobile data, gps, videos and other functions, 2. touch response is ok.... 3. not using it for gaming so without gaming no lags... 4. display is normal.... 5.  camera is ok.....overall good phone for normal usage not for gaming

"
"

  Respected sir, Camera may be increased high quality and pixels resolution also,then,data icon can be click ,It may be go to the particulars settings position.Next,It is swipe top to downward the hotspot shortcut key may be provided in the desktop...Thank you sir,

"
"

  Good Phone

"
"

  I have used Samsung, Redmi, Sony, Vivo phones, but I had never experienced such a sound system, it's great and First time I bought Oppo phone and its awesome. Just go for it.

"

  Good phone with exchangeDesign- 5 starPerformance- 4 starCamera - 1 starBattery - 4 star

"
"

  writing this review after two months of usage:Great phone at this price,but don't think massive battery lasts for 2 to3 days,it lasts for only 1 day.Camera is good for this price, finger print is too fast, front camera is average,display is good for this segment, charging takes moe than 2hr30 min to full charge,better than vivo at this price segment,processor is doing it's job well for games.Over all a good phone🙂🙂

"
"

  Had gifted my aunt as I was working on budget.  However, I don't like it's camera not picture quality.Although it is still working strong but my aunty's usuage is minimal.

"
"

  nice built phone, everything tremendous with economical budget purchase. Next we will update in near future about performance and its life durability about storage /RAM/ROM /SPEED.ALL app working nicely. camera image are also satisfactory.

"
"

  Super phone in this price range.Good quality of camera, sound etc...Finger print and face recognition readers still not checked and tried, based on the mobile performance  hopefully they also work well.Excellent product. Protective case given with this pack also excellent.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone.  I got a broken phone.  It is not yet ready to be replaced or remedied.  They provide a very poor quality phone

"
"

  camera quality is too poor

"
"

  5 🌟 , good opportunity with to exchange. Happy with this.

"
"

  Battery heats up a bit if used for a sometime and during charging. Battery life does not look like 5000mAh if we see it getting low compared to iphones with way lesser mAh. Camera is fine. Apps and OS looks stable prima facie.

"
"

  fingerprint and faceunlock very fast.dolby sound osmmm.video quality average .battery best.day light camera good but not good for night  realy .pubg play smooth no problam .mobile look and fell osmmm.

"
"

  Very Good phone in this budget.Nice get up.phone quality,battery back up awsome.This white colors fells good.Quad camera quality are awsme.....Enjoy it...

"
"

  Bkwas phone totally don't buy, this phone its over weighted phone , and over price camera quality very bad 8 mp only ,and price 14000  , better than u can go for realme 3 pro , redmi note 8 , honor 8x , honor 20i, ...etc.😒

"
"

  Camera is up to mark with exchange price of mine at 8 k but not worth of for 14 k price. Battery backup is almost good for a day use of normal (without accessing high games)  .

"
"

  i just bought it 6 hours agocamera quality is not even descent.it doesn't even supports google payadd 2k more to your budget and you can get something better  buy this phone on your own risk.

"
"

  Bought for 7k with exchangeReviewing after one monthBattery backup is good compared to my old device Moto e5 plus.Dual Speakers r of very good quality.Dolby surround is awesome.Camera clearity is just ok.C type charge supports little fast charging.Build quality is good.Better to buy with exchange.

"
"

  The best value phone at this price. I was sceptical about its camera quality..but the camera clicks decent pictures. I exchanged my xiomi redmi 7A and got it for 7200. Trust me it's worth every penny. It is quite smooth, good display and great sound quality. Build quality is quite solid. Highly satisfied at this price...pics attached for your reference guys.

"
"

  The Battery life is wonderful, it last's two day's in standard use, no gaming. The UI lag's some times, but I can tolerate that, but when it comes to the both side camera's it's avarage, not a good one and also absolutely not a better one !! Details are so low!!!! But other things are good. Considering the price point it's a avarage choise.

"
"

  The product is very bad. It hangs a lot and I have bought 1 month ago. I can't imagine so dirty product in terms of phone lag.I would recommend no one to buy this phone.I want replacement for this phone at any costIt would be great OPPO can replace my phone as I have purchased recently one month ago.They have fooled us badly.

"
"

  As I heard of, that Oppo phone near are good,same I foundTough quality with white color..apprantly seems uniqueFast charging support, 5000 mah charged in 1 hour+ time.C type pin never fails or damage- it is my one day review only, but looking it is best phone I purchased..

"
"

  I was looking for good mobile and finally in doubt I bought this though i was already using Oppo brand....And seriously I got love with this mobileIf u r looking for some mobiles below 15K then this may meet your needs....Camera 4.5/5Fingerprint 5/5Battery life 5/5

"
"

  Excellent phone, nice features, great pics, nice specs

"
"

  MOBILE IS GETTING HANG 3THRICE IN A DAY AND CAN NOT WORK FOR 30 MIN WHEN HANG

"
"

  Very nice and hardy phone... But charging pin is different than other smart phones... Made in india... Thats make very satisfied to me

"
"

  I was tried Redmi 9 on flash sales but no luck and I hated flash sale :) I bought this phone but no regret, it works as expected I liked.

"
"

  A good choice mobile in tight budget segment Decent camera,Good battery life and sound quality only drawback i found i.e, fast charging..

"
"

  dear sir / madam,please note that we recieved the mobile phone today  morning .but please note that unfortunately there ois no headphones provided .pleases take action on the following  .

"
"

  Network LockThis phone has Network Lock. This can be used only in India. After writing so many mail to customer service, there was no one to solve the issue. But they give only false hope.If you are a frequent traveller, get it solved before leaving India. I ended up with buying a new phone in my destination.

"
"

  please return or replace this delivery product today . very poor camera quality . Worthless . I am not getting return option

"
"

  I have got this phone with exchange Mi4 ₹ 7.6K.Delivery is very fast, happy to shopping with amezon.Oppo A5 2020 good phone.camera and battery quality is good,classic finished, excellent features... happy...***

"
"

  Excellent mobile from OPPO.picture quality is  excellent.worth to purchase the 4/64 mobile with quad cam.Huge battery of 5000maH,which is long losting.As compared to other peers ,this mobile is the best.

"
"

  Order delivered fast. But not happy with oroduct. It gets heat enough. Battery drains very fast. Hangs and reboot auto between 2 to 6 hrs.Talk to amazon they said if technician says then only it will replace. They have scheduled technician at monday.

"
"

  Good looking phones with average quality camera and performance, but dual speaker sound is impressive.... But its price (comparing to its features offered) is high.

"
"

  Poor camera and build quality.Pathetic display. Very heavy.Only plus is the battery. Not very suitable for gaming.

"
"

  First time ordered it was not working. Apps were not working n touch screen issues got it replaced still faced same issue. Got it remotely checked by amozon technical team so found ter is issue with the phone so got it cancelled n waiting for refund

"
"

  Excellent product. Worth it.  Continue to provide best services like this. Best wishes for your image development.👌👍

"
"

  12MP+8MP+2MP+2MP this is nothing but a worst camera quality. Oppo is famous with good camera quality but now a days they are cheating customers with the name of good camera.

"
"

  Awesome👍 product.Battry is awesome😊👏But not a fast charging 🔋⚡3 hr. To full charge from 15 %Camera is awesome in this bujet.Value of mony.Thanks to amezon for fast डैल्वेरी।

"
"

  Pros:Event camera and battery lifeCons:No notification light, weak speakers, weak vibrationNo vibration settings, hangs with multiple apps running simultaneously, processor not upto mark.

"
"

  Though it's purchased for my aunt, camera battery Dolby atmos and UI are pretty good.If u are a camera lover go for it undoubtedly best and no issues of lagging

"
"

  the reason this phone is so high on specs and low on price is because Oppo has integrated advertisement popup on various random apps, so if you are okay with that its very good phone, also camera is average despite having 4 cam setup on the back.

"
"

  ProsBig bright displayGood ram managementNo heating issuesNo adsCon'sCamera quality poorNo fast chargingNo android10Non full HD display

"
"

  Duel speaker sounds quality superbest Dolby Atmos

"
"

  Good mobile in budget...Sound quality 👌👌👌Battery blackup superbCamera 👌Overall value for money product

"
"

  Smooth screen ....good fingerprint sences, good camera clarity...but at night a little blur images...but that's ok

"
"

  Sound Quality & battery is very good, camera quality is average, software slow. This is only for Normal user. Color & build quality is good.

"
"

  Take is taken to full charge time,10 to 100 percentage more than 3 hrs time, when I opened my new phone it is getting hang and apps r opened not fast,so my opinion is not a gud phone

"
"

  I never thought this phone will be this good for this price!!really awesome. The sound quality is better than iPhone.trust me a decent 160sq room can completely here the sound.pic clarity are pretty good.and the screen size is big.over all worth buy product.

"
"

  Amazing product and great camera quality stylish look

"
"

  Regarding Parcel - Worst &  Poor Packing., Missing headphone.About phone : Average. Takes long time to charge and over heating. Compare to this OPPO A5 2020 my 3yrs old Moto G5 plus is 1000 times better. My suggestion is to buy MOTOROLA product.

"
"

  Thanks for delivery within 24 hoursOverall good phone camera quality struggles in low light and have slow image processing so i suggest you if you are a normal user buy 3gb varient, if you are a havey user then spend more money and consider other products thank you.

"
"

  Camera is extreme bad.I have oppo a37f and it has better camera quality than oppo A5 2020.Disappointing mobile.It has1.Bad camera.2.Bad display.3.unsatisfactory performance.4.High price as compared to phone quality.5.Non hd display

"
"

  Not as expected, the phone lags. I have not installed heavy Apps or Games. This is the first I went for oppo, a bit disappointed.

"
"

  Value for Money Quad Camera Phone and looks stunning as well. Only draw back is the heavyness of the device but it is what now generation phone are weighing.

"
"

  Excellent phone in an affordable price... just luv it...good features. Good camera. Earphones also available

"
"

  A superb budget phone. Got it for Rs 8250/- after exchange of my old phone. For that price, the phone is really satisfactory. Camera is good and the battery life is excellent. Overall very happy with oppo A5 2020.

"
"

  One of the best phone ever bought by me. Review after one year of use

"
"

  Best mobile at this price.... good working..  if night mode is also included in this mobile,  then it will be more  awesome...

"
"

  Yesterday I got my Oppo A5 2020, as per details it was mentioned that in box headset is also available but after delivery it was found there is no headset. Sound quality of headset from other companies are not good with Oppo A5 2020.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader working too fast.Battery life is duriable.Camera quality is good.Overall I think that this phone is good for this price.;

"
"

  WITHIN 2 MONTHS THE PHONES GETS HUNG EVERYDAY AT-LEAST 5-10 TIMES(WHEN I TRY TO UNLOCK)PATHETIC PRODUCT I NEVER SEEN.I STRONGLY RECOMMENDS NOT TO BUY THIS STUPID PRODUCT.

"
"

  I bought for my mom....only for the battery and big screen are really fantastic..battery life is very good... Where she can watch serial on her mobile.. Enough for her 4gb ram and 64 inbulit... Camera is ok... Fingerprint is slightly slower... Need fast and quick...

"
"

  I just bought this phone and found everything great about it except one thing - size of the phone. I wish I could get the same configuration in a phone with size of around 5"" and that too should be pocket friendly.

"
"

  The mobile is so good. I have not expected such good camera quality and was confused between Red Mi and Oppo. But after using Oppo, i can say I have made a good decision by buying Oppo.Delivery was so fast, i got phone within 24 hour of order.So overall good experience.

"
"

  Nice phone and good display.dolby sound is awesome. Battery is amazing.worth buying.

"
"

  Camera quality at night is very bad,battery life is good but it does not support fast charging and display is hd+ not full HD+ but it's ok sound is amazing Dolby atom is good .overall  good but camera is bed

"
"

  The battery is standing for 36hrs after full charging. But the charger is not fast charger. Camera quality is ok

"
"

  All good gamming performance good free fire pubg lite handling nice pubg mobile I am not playing camera normal mode worst go to camera setting ultra hd camera mode available this mode photo quality good sound superb battery full charge time 2h 30 min. No heat mobile not bad good mobile

"
"

  I liked the overall quality of the mobile.. Battery backup is superb. Display, processor, speed, are well balanced with the performance of the device.. But camera quality could have been better.. I was expecting better quality cameras.. But they are OK... At this price... Design and looks are elegant, attractive... Everyone loved it...

"
"

  Best phone in this range ..my wife big fan of oppo. Look wise very nice ...i bought this phone for my wife,,batry is good..camera quality better than other phone like,, redmi or realme..bcz last time i was used redmi 6 pro.....

"
"

  Excellent product @ this budget price point. Build is solid, interface is smart for ease of use. Its a good buy...

"
"

  It's camera and build quality is very bad compare to other manufacturers and again this cost more than those product. I don't understand why they make such bad products and price is also fluctuate a lot. I buy it at 12500 and now this is available at 10990. So this twice before buying this.

"
"

  Dealer not good......headphone mation on box, but headphone not availabe in box.

"
"

  Good Budget phone within 15k

"
"

  The phone is sooo good at processing and back camera is awesome! But I dont like the front camera 👎 it's not as much as I expected..battery is good..its fast charging..worth buying thz mobile !👍 Some times it hangs idk why 👎  other than that its so niz with all the futures

"
"

  Mobile is good in this price range ,except camera performance. So many cameras are there but picture quality is not good.

"
"

  Very good phone in this range, only blemish in fast charging is missing..was expected in 2020 model after having set the bar high with fast charging...still other features are top notch!!

"
"

  Comes with factory fitted tampered glass,  immediately you can do android 10 with color 7.1 update, takes 2 hours for full charging,  it comes to 24 hours with moderate usage.  Cons.. camera is over hyped,  and  internet disconnection observed occasionally

"
"

  No, dislikes only likes, so for it's good .we are using for online study purpose mainly. Finger print reader added a extra privacy, camera & battery life is excellent. Totally good choice for the online study and general purpose too

"
"

  Worth for price..camera lens perfect...Sound effect is tremendous..Headphone inbuilt🥰..Back case inbuit😃..Battery life perfect..Highly valuable...

"
"

  Worst phone it drains the battery very fast battery is defective.and the headphone jack is also defective doesn't connect any headphone .dont waste mony for these phone.Amazon service is also the worst if the phone having replace policy they doesn't replace it .

"
"

  A budget smartphoneWith great processorExcellent gaming (PUBG)Superb camera features with great clarityFast Fingerprint with face unlockDolby Atmos sound systemAnd fast charging compared with 18watt vivo charger

"
"

  Well this is one of the best budget mobile with good build quality and features.

"
"

  High performance, happy to use the next generation specifications. Really more than the money spent

"
"

  very gud Mobile....oppo is always oppo....!!!this is the best mob I have used so far...!!!

"
"

  No problems until now. The only thing that disappoints is the camera quality. The marketing shows that camera is good and all but it’s not.Otherwise the phone is good as per the price

"
"

  It is Good For House wife women,Who doesn't have gaming interest.Battery life is very excellent. Back camera is some have better and fornt camera is disappointed. Charging also some delay.

"
"

  Very nice mobile.we can say that it is value for money mobile . Battery life is good.. I play freefire that after it give me a backup of 1 day. And without playing game it give me 2 days back up .so battery is excellent.Camera is good but not excellent.

"
"

  Very nice smart phone and big screen size looking very hot also in budget

"
"

  Camera seems ok for normal photography.Should provide fast charger takes too long about 2-3 hours for full charge.. battery backup is good full day with full charge and about 30% left end of the day.

"
"

  when I ordered it  I thought that it will not give me that type of performance but seriously I just loved it. The color is also fab. and the camera quality is also good but not the best I think. Overall I only say that just go for it

"
"

  Good Mobile. I was the Redmi user before this mobile. Compared to redmi, oppo's quality particularly this mobile is not up to the level. Overall it is good mobile but not very good.

"
"

  Very good facial unlocking. Works fast and even in dim lights. Huge battery.

"
"

  Awesome battery life. Camera is not up to mark. Everything is ok.

"
"

  Product was as detailed... But the sreen protector was scratched and there were multiple cracks on the screen protector of the mobile... Completely unpredicted from Amazon.

"
"

  Everything are awesome. Sound quality are superb, double Dolby sound.

"
"

  Received defect item, requested for replacement. Tear at the bottom of screen. Is it really a Gorilla glass ?, Company claims it is Gorilla glass but i dont think so.Product is good.

"
"

  I bought OPPP A5 after doing lot of research.ProsBattery back up,Good performance, Not tried big games thoughCons:No Notification lightThis is good phone in this segment. we can go for it.

"
"

  There is a defect in the screen. A technician is expected to visit in 2 days and check if it's eligible for replacement. Will update then

"
"

  Too much heating issue and no battery backup i was return this product 2 time

"
"

  Product is good and received with good conditions. Delivery boy is also cooperative ..got my product as per my conveinient time and place.  Thanks for providing delivery boy z contact number which is very much helpful for the customer.. Thanks and regards

"
"

  Camera quality good battery life good not for gaming you can’t play pubg . Pubg lite lack in this device without gameplay mobile is value of money

"
"

  Value for money phnCamera quality is good not very good.Battery is awesomeLook by dhasu

"
"

  Good phone but they didn't provide earphones nice battery good display but poor camera performance good gift for parents ☺️ pubg performance is awesome and Dolby Atmos gives better feel in music thanks oppo for this beautiful phone.

"
"

   Nice product all are ok but camera quality upgrade much more and main importan a fablous head phone is in the box and a quality back cover this phone act as a dolby speeker. Speeker quality very good

"
"

  Renewed product, because its screen has no proper finish at its edge, I compare it with another set of same onba mobile shope. U r cheater Amazon!!

"
"

  Camera would hav been better.Battery life is good but no fast charging a let down.Sound is good.No earphones.

"
"

  Too good vs price or can say unbelievable phone at this price 11990.👍👍

"
"

  * Fingerprint reader goes sometimes 2/5 🌟* 🔋 Life better' 3/5 🌟 although having 5000mAh* Camera quality 4/5 🌟

"
"

  Very good mobile. It is value for money. OPPO camera quality is also good as well as battery life. I recommended to buy this phone if u go for this range of budget.

"
"

  Best value for money mobile phone. Everything in a nice package. Camera would have been a little better but at this price point nothing better can be expected. Overall good buy.

"
"

  I gifted it to my mom as birthday gift...she really felt happy. Features, speed,power backup, look is what she needs and this phone really caters all her needs.

"
"

  A good phone in this budget, I bought this for my maid, a good phone and value for money.

"
"

  Best phone in it's budget comes with Android pie and really good camera it's better than my 25000 phone which I bought 2 months before it.

"
"

  LOOKS WISE TO GOOD, Camera & Battery is also good.. I like it.. superb phone in this budget.👌👌🤗

"
"

  I've purchased Oppo first time and I would say This is the best phone.Camera Quality better than Mi and Battery performance is also good,Specially it's Back design is too good.This phone is little be costally against Xioami but honestly this is the best.

"
"

  Great phone

"
"

  Oral best in price good mobile build quality in very good

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is small in size hence take some time to search , performance is good 4.5*Battery is also Good 4.5*Camera in low light some improvement required 4.0*

"
"

  Phone touch is very bad , Very Slow responding....not user friendly.....no notification lights....it's just in 2 days only

"
"

  The look of the phone is goodBut when it comes to charging it take more than a hourThe camera as such is not goodAnd sound quality is also not lowOverall it doesn't value for money

"
"

  Good product but the front camera is very very poor. Back is alright with flash.Looks wise amazing phone. Battery life good too. Buy it if you're not a huge fan of selfies and can compromise on camera.

"
"

  Oppo, camera phone.Worst quality of camera.Very bad experience with oppo A5 2020.Please, friends don't buy it,  go with samsung.

"
"

  The phone is good but the camara quality should be more of it will be increased the phone is excelentI have booked another phone because the phone superbAll should purchase it

"
"

"
"

  most of the phone are not available.By lots of research i choose this phone from all which are available on amazon.big battery life, Big display, good processor, Best sound quality, overall a good phone.

"
"

  finger print and camera is good.Phone looks is actually good.Battery performance is good but charging system is not good.I connect the plug with phone after 1 hours charging this phone is hot.why????

"
"

  My marks: Finger print sensor  -3.5/5 Battery life - 4/5 Camera quality- 3/5 Sound quality -Dolby sound not bad - 4/5 Display- average -3.5/5 Video quality - Not satisfactory- 3/5

"
"

  I am not expected the sound quality of Dolby atoms' I am enjoy to hear the songs to this OPPO A5 device. Overall this device is best in this price range. This one device  is my best choice. Thanks to Amazon and Appario.

"
"

  Not 64 GB,Only 46.6 GB Available Storage

"
"

   Battery is awesomeFinger print reader is goodCamera quality is good

"
"

  I like all the features but only dissappointment thing is ear phone is missing in the box but oppo providing earphone but i wont get, inthe box.where is my earphone ,amazonIts really bad.but camera is exeiLlent

"
"

  Very disappointing...headset missing in the package Inspite of declaring that there will be headset in the package...

"
"

  Do not waste your money in it.Facing charging issue within 15 days and now visiting oppo  service centre on daily basis but issue not resolved yet. Now saying wait for 1 week to change some part in the phone.

"
"

  It's a good mobile in this price.Go for it

"
"

  Wrost camera but if you ignore camera quality then go for it during this lockdown situation.

"
"

  I have bought two phones one for me one for my sister however when I went Tunisia both phones didn't detect foreign sim card .I need to unlock network using code that only the retail shop has it not able to contact you

"
"

  Lovely mobile

"
"

  Camera is very gud with some special features like...night mode,ultrawide,slow Mo,and for both front n back camera potrait mode is available...easy to use... definitely I would suggest to go for it... without any hesitation.♥️

"
"

  Am really trusted on amazon Awesome phone lovly design white colour is so cool phone price on amazon is low then other online shopping sightsThanks Amazon

"
"

  Don't buy this phone when you have Samsung M series.

"
"

  Ordered for my niece. She is in love woth the phone.

"
"

  Notification senser not available in this phoneBattery quality not so goodCharging speed very slowPhone heating problem alsoThis is bad experience for me regarding oppo A52020 phone

"
"

  Fingerprint reader, battery life,camera quality is good...but i want to ask u why it heats while charging.. it heats too much why ??

"
"

  First time experience dolby-atmos😍. And i love it. Although a perfect smartphone at 12k. Battery life super, display looks awesome, phone look damn good in white, only the thing missing is Fast charging.

"
"

  It's really worth for 12,000 guys. No heating issues, pubj can play 1.30 hours without any heating ,lagging. With quadcamera, sd665 processer,dolby Atmos speaker for this was awesome deal. Don't miss it🤗

"
"

  Value for money . After using I would like to give this phone 5 Stars. Detail Review is :Touch - very smoothBattery - AwesomePerformance- Very Good after using all typical apps

"
"

  Device is awesome. Camera is good, battery is good.

"
"

  Good at this price point with a processor of SD665.

"
"

  All things are excellent expect camera could have been better

"
"

  Phone has hanging prob. And suddenly phone stopped workingSome times its lock not openBut look is pretty good..Battery life is better than other but chargig time is too long

"
"

  I am posting my review after the use of 2 months,so honestly telling mobile working very very well in all aspects specially its dolby sound & signal strength is decent enough but still rate should be under 10k.

"
"

  I don't know yet but I think this is budget friendly.Don't believe if anyone says battery will get charged within 1&half an hour.. believe me battery takes 3 hours to complete charge.

"
"

  The camera quality is average, battery life is good, UI is excellent but the price is bit higher in comparison with other phones available in 13K

"
"

  It is not supporting indian language.if i select other country english language,then indian date format is not supporting in ms excel app

"
"

  All ok but camera not ok speaker good display ok

"
"

  Everything is awesome from oppo.The best part is the stereo sound with dual speakers. It's too smooth ..Doesn't feel like 3 gm ram ..It's too fast ..Good work oppo

"
"

  Excellent phone, the sound of the phone is awesome and the battery life is awesome, satisfied with the product

"
"

  Good, using since 2 months,no problem at all.

"
"

  Better to wait some time and buy good phoneIts battery backup is so badIf you spend extra 1000 rupee you can buy redmi note 9 which consists 48mp ai quad camera with 5000 mah battery

"
"

  Best smartphone in budget , camera quality is also very nice , fingerprint is also fast and good and it's gaming performance is also smooth and goodI loved this phone ❤️

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Perfomance is very bad....I suggest never buy this phone ....hate this product ....it have no return policy also ....they are making fool to us ...by selling this type of product ....

"
"

  Phone design is superb also the phone functionality easily User friendly.but camera not that much quality also phone hanging whenni took photot it's loading 3secs then only can take next photo

"
"

  Phone is amazing video playback excellent and sound. I never feel hd screen look like full hd screen

"
"

  Meet the expectations. Fingerprint reader is not that accurate. But ok it's good. Camera is above average. Battery life is excellent. Speakers are also very good.Overall good mobile for the price of 11k.

"
"

  Received the product in within 24 hoursLooks good on hand in Dazzling White colour.Also received my previous refund in 2 working days by AmazonGrt service hope it will maintain in future too.

"
"

  In the description headset was included but  there is no headset in my mobile box..please rectify this type of issues

"
"

  Very slow software. Apps are taking too much time to start. Hanging problem always. Heating issue.

"
"

  Phone is good. I am not sure whether it is 5000 mAH battery or 3000 mAH because battery is draining very quickly cant be use full day even after charging 100%.Camera quality is excellent.

"
"

  I bought it for one of my friend, he told me the mobile is good and he liked very much......

"
"

  Worst mobile from the starting only mobile is struck and no proper resolution done yet.Dont go for this mobile.

"
"

  I am happy with the product but the selfie cam could have been better. You can get this phone for a price range from 8,000-9,000. Don't get this phone for the actual price.

"
"

  It is good mobile but oppo should sell this mobile 9k.

"
"

  Good phone from oppo. Excellent camera and battery life. My father is using it for 1 months and he is liking it very much. Dazzling white is best color variant. Go for it.

"
"

  No option for a Screen lock pattern & it's only showing fingerprint & face option ,, fingerprint option not working properly & screen double tap option also not there in this mobile very bad

"
"

"

"
"

  Good deal at this price range. Stylish and easy to use. Thanks Amazon for 1day delivery. Very fast.

  No where on the site it is mentioned that  3gb variant has no headphone  ,  oppo is cheating by not  mentioning this on product page  . Amazon is sitting silent on this issue  .

"
"

  Finger print ok battery okCamera quality, average, and display from other mob oppo

"
"

  What is like is : i had buy it in exchange offer.The major cons: I found its heavy and not slim.

"

  The mobile phone is excellent but the earplugs doesn't came with it asper it's price it should either give earplugs otherwise the phone should support the fast charger

"
"

  Phone is good..but missing headphones.in my box.. little disappointed.

"
"

  Not so good not so bad. It's okay price is towards very higher side.

"
"

  When I received this then I found that it's Mike and speaker is not working.Then I returned it.

"
"

  Overall the phone is good but the facial recognition is not so good... It takes multiple attempts to open for facial recognition... Rest all is good

"
"

  Performance ok good for free fire normal for pubg cam quality is below average i byed 4gb phn is 10800 its average phn for ths rate

"
"

  Blue line on screen

"
"

  The range in which this phone is, is quite good and its look attracts a lot of people.

"
"

  Budget phone.Looks great. Performance is good, display is fantastic.Only thing is the camera is a little sluggish and grainy especially in low light environments.

"
"

  ☺

"
"

  Sleek

"
"

  Doesn't support multi user mode. Came with very old OS version. Keypad quality not good. Heavy phone not easy to carry.Regards,Amber

"
"

  Worst camera. Looks like a 2 megapixel photo.Look, feel and battery backup is goodThe gaming experience is decent.

"
"

  Worst quality at this price. Selling low quality mobile with increased prices. Suggest go for samsung even if it costs 2 to 3 thousand additional.

"
"

  Don't buy, phone stopped working after 8 days of purchaseTill then exchnge period got over, now I am taking round of service centre

"
"

  Ok👍👍

"
"

  Fingerprint small and camera not good

  Amazing device with This price point and battery backup was amazing I have order this for my friend and it was so happy with this phone

"
"

  Only the camera carity not that much great.just okay.but other futures is good and phone is good for parents.

"
"

  Not Highly recommended because better phone is available in same price segment, But best for general and durable uses

"
"

  gets hang regularly also works very slowly can run 2 application at a time. didn't received my cashback in hdfc card even after the purchased using that card

"
"

  This mobile has the same futures compare to other mobiles.

"
"

  All n all great experience.only there is one issue that it takes about 1sec in face recognition of the person &all else everything is fine

"
"

  Comfortable . Good sound quality. Camera quality is good but not best. Completely fine with finger print reader and battery life.

  As compare to vivo & realme even Samsung providing 48 mp,camera vise little bit disappointing..and they are not providing fast cahrger.But overall performance is. Good and look vise phone is also gud.Overall

"

  Ok guys this mobile is a look stealer but not performance one ...just don't go with looks the waste of dolby atmos speakers it's got a low volume and it's 📷 is of Penta setup but it sucks just like a 5mp camera...it fails fo capture properly at night at day it does a decent job ...next coming to it's display it has got good viewing angle with bright and vivid colours... people can but this if look matters and you need a oppo beand❤️

"
"

  Pros-1.Good looking2. Nice display3. Good batteryCons-1. No fast charging2. Display is nice but not full HD, I don't understand why3. Bit heavy in weight4. No pattern locking5. No double tap to wake up the screen6. Provided quad camera just to attract customers, camera quality not up to the mark as compared to MI in the same range7. Overall an average phone with high price

  All opportunity mobile have a drawback I felt that is the position of power button and volume button. These are placed on both sides of mobile in so oddly that the chances of pressing both the button at a time if u want to switch on the mobile and a screenshot is captured. The ideal positions of the butuons should be on the same sides of the mobile.either left or right. Very very odd placing. It's really very irritating.

"

  Best option for exchange, I got it in 9k ,Review score (out of 5)Design : 4.5 (finger print scanner position is bit high), other things like screen size, corners,back panel, camera position are perfect and it's light weight too...Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor)Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good.Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.Performance : not played many games but seems good, while opening any game auto memory cleaner will run,lag and heat issue is not there (checked continuously 1.5 hours)Memory space : 46 GB free space, all basic apps are pre installed, separate as card slot is available (apart from 2 SIM slot), 1.86 GB ram available after all updation, while playing any game also 900 to 1 GB space is availablePros : apart from above mentioned points :1)Front cam is good like other similar phone (mi, real me, honor, Samsung)2) earphones quality/look is very good in this range.3) dual speaker position is in front top of display and near to charging pin, so stereo comes properly4)face detection is fast5)no heating issue while charging /YouTube /gaming6) battery is lasting for more than 4 days on normal usesCons:1) fingerprint scanner position is bit high2) ram 6 GB would have a perfect option3) macro photos are not that good compare to redmi 7 pro4) no fast charger with pack

  Now days all screens are maximum getting hd Or hdr in pubg game...But its only support like as regular phone like below 8k also...

  Very Good budget phone. I got this power packed beast at Rs. 12860 After exchange for Honor 7C. Which is very Dishonored phone and idiotic. You can check the resolution which is awesome best phone at very good price. Battery is massive 5000mAh which is power factory.

"
"

  Good mobile.new latest features.As compared to prize 3gb ram is not fairOppo must give 4gb ram.And I fill bitt of hang problem which is not good.

"
"

  I am using  oppo A5 2020 within 2 days .Battery life is very good .heavy usage of games,videos, still one day full stay battery life.Best processor.Gaming performance :Game run smoothly ,play heavy graphics like free fire,pubg,call of duty  games are run smoothly in ultra HD graphics no lag issues in I am not facing.Display:HD + display all over ok.Camera :Medium

"
"

  The phone is heavy and definitely meets its long lasting power backup challenge. But it has a serious set back when camera performance is taken to count.I have compared camera with my 2 to 3 year old mobile which was also within 15k range which gave better photo results.

"
"

  I purchased this phone by exchange.. . What ever i have my old phone accessories i mention that only... than y thay cancelled my order....

"
"

  Damage products.. Chargee is not working.. Duplicate phone sold on Amazon dont buy this phone.. Amazon sell duplicate phone with brand name

"
"

  Camera quality is worst.Don't buy.Redmi note 8 is 1000 time better then this.Charging completed in 3 hours.Nokia 1200 camera is better then this.Waste of money.If you are going to buy this then that's the biggest mistake.I am really disappointed after buying oppo a5 2020. Within 1 hour of use.I suggested you to don't buy this otherwise that's your choice.If you don't believe see that pics

"
"

  An okay kind of phone at this cost.Rather than working on the mega pixel they need to work on providing better camera lense.Screen quality is average.Battery is great.UI is also good for the price.Ram- is great.I recommend you to think n look at other options as well before you buy this phone.

"
"

  Display viewing angle is not that much good ! In this price range this only model have a Dolby Atmos stereo speakers really awesome sound, If you are interested in watching movies and YouTube videos or music lover I will strongly recommend this phone.

"
"

  Nice productGood feuters I am satisfied with oopo used to  originally from andra Pradesh thanks so much for your

"
"

  I used this phone this is good phone in my life

"
"

  Display and battery life is really good . Camera is okay.And fingerprint and face recognition are good.Backover is also provided . Charging is also very fast.Overall value for money . And amazon delivery and packaging was good.👍

"

  Overall performance is good but multiple messages delete option is not there, photo folder view is not so good,photos I'm contact images whatapp images are not clear.

  This is worst phone i see ever phone is hang lags and screen blackout and touch not work on the first dayCome and collect this bundle phone

"
"

  Overall excellent phone...with exceptional camera quality and Zero lag performance...little heavy but worth it considering the 5k Mah battery .....safely the best in class for this price range !!!

"
"

  Oppo is wrost brand dont buy its display protection is fake its bricked after dropping from 1 feet and its no future updates no any updates will come in this phone dont have fastboot mode after 3 months battery  lasts 3 hour's playing pubg

"
"

  Simple, Sophisticated, and easy to use.If you are an average spender who likes finesse of things, they can look into this phone

"
"

  It's an amazing phone with wonderful features. We no need to install extra apps to hide apps, photos, files etc. It's all inbuilt. And it's battery backup is awesome no words to say.  It's amazing phone there is no loss of ur money.

"
"

  Don't even think about this mobile. Lots of lags. I mean literally lots of lags. Just waste of money. If anyone is happy with this phone then he must be oppo lover and he never used any phone other than oppo. Not even worth.

"
"

  Bad battery heating phone. Operating system not optimal

"
"

  Do not buy Chines phones

"

  Pathetic phone.. its not even a month dince i bought this phone.. and its get hanged for a good 2-3 hours. At that time m not able to switch it off..no touch works.. very bad experience.

"
"

  This phone s good for sound lovers only.Worse phone but if you're looking a descent stereo speakers then go for itCamera is worse ever camera I've ever seen.

"
"

  Battery life is so good charge on one time you can use on at least three days nice phone but camra was not good in this price if you want to a take good pic this is not good for this so I won't suggest to buy this phone

"
"

  Not bad .....but touch is not so smooth and fast.but according to price is best phone.Not support fast charge. Performance is better.

"
"

  I am not game lover and camera, usually I watch movie, serial in hot star and listening music. For these reason this mobile is very suitable for me because it have dual speakers stero loud speakers.

"
"

  This is very decent device, great battery life, decent camera, decent display, great size, Dolby atmosphere if there would be full HD display, then it would be a great package

"
"

  Awesome features & battery 🔋 backup 👍

"
"

  Design is good but quite issue with finger print...let's wait for more days. If finger print didn't work then  Amazon and Oppo screwed by me.

"

   🔆Got it for a friend who wanted something other than samsung and here are my observations for it. ♦️Pros :👍Extremely budget device.👍Decently fast AI enabled mid-range octa core processor snap dragon 665 for medium level gaming.👍Bigger 6.52-inch IPS Full HD screen , for better multimedia experience.👍Good look & feel too, very solid.👍Quad-camera setup allowing for variety of shots, depth , macro or ultrawide shots.👍Decent solid construction with corning gorilla glass 3 screen.👍Face recognition with Fingerprint sensor at the back for additional security.👍Supports latest Bluetooth version 5.👍Fingerprint repellent front and back glass body.👍Good full day battery of 5000 mAh backup with reversible charging & a fast charger.👍Inbuilt youtube & other applications with widevine.👍Dual 4G Volte enabled sim with a dedicated separate microsd slot.👍Good selfie shots & effects👍Dual speakers with clear stereo and loud sound .👍 Comes with a silicone cover & earphone included in pack.As for the cons :👎 Screen resolution is just 1600 x 720 only HD not 2300 x 1080 FHD+ so clarity is less.👎 Main back camera is not accurate in colors at different angles & focussing is bit late.Clarity at low lights is also not good.👎 Offering android 9 only , whereas Samsung offering android 10.👎A better 6000 mAh battery is being offered in Samsung.👎Bit dull screen contrast compared to Samsung amoled.👎Not very loud sound through speakers.👎Overall package is less compared to similar priced Samsung 🤏 Final verdict:*********************🔹️Considering the overall package, I suppose Samsung M21 offers a better value for the price in camera , battery , processor , android version looks and in hand feel.🔹️Yet for those interested in something other than Samsung in extreme budget, oppo A5  is surely good enough.♻️ Do click helpful below , if the review was helpful to you.

  Writing the review after using the phone for more than a week.✌️✌️Oppo A5 2020 is a decent budget range smartphone with Android 10(after the update) .Camera is good but definitely not the best. One plus point is that you get a pre-installed goggle lens which is a very useful feature .Battery is 4890 mah upto 5000 mah.Phone gets charge to 1% to 100 % in almost 2 hours. Battery works smoothly.Disappointed with its display which comes with HD+ display but not full hd+ display.I also received an earphone in the box which is good but it is of local quality and you will definitely find such earphone at 80 ~ 100 Rs in the market.The phone comes with a pre-applied screen protector with a transparent backcover.Coming to sound quality , the sound is just awesome because of it comes with Dolby stereo sound which produces 3D sound effects even in full voloume with crystal clear sound. Music lovers will definitely love this phone.The phone back has a good grip in hand with a glossy white rainbow finishing. You will love the rainbow efftect in your phone from the back if you ordered white colored Oppo A5 2020.Coming to gaming experience, it does the job. I have palyed both pubg as well as free fire in high quality and the game runs smoothly . Thanks to the game booster 2.0 provided by oppo which is really useful while playing games . It also comes with a feature of no notifications feature to avoid any disturbance while playing the game.It also comes with pre-installed screen recorder and long screenshot features which is really useful.Also , the last thing which I would like to mention is that it comes with lots of pre-installed Chinese apps. I would definitely suggest you to unistalled all of the Chinese apps for your privacy and data security purposes.Sugestion :-You can go with this phone if you a are a music lover who listens music at high volumes or most of the time on speakers .Gaming persons can buy this phone for average usage. But if you are a heavy gamer perosn, than please don't buy this phone because it does not cones with a fast charger which is definitely essential for a gaming person.Person with average use can go for it as it does all kinds of jobs at one place.✌️

  Very nice phone. I needed a spare phone for my office sim and found this once to be very good value for money. I got it for 10,999 on 6 month: no cost EMI. Now at this price point, I have lots of pros for this device:1) Snapdragon 665: A very capable processor.2) Huge 5000 mah battery.3) Quad Camera  Setup.4) Metal Body.5) Real Glass back.16) Android 10.7) Factory installed screen guard and soft case.Things that could have been better at this price point:1) Screen Resolution is only HD.2) Battery Charging could be faster than 10W.

  Writing this review after almost a week. Got it in a deal with around 5k off from MRP in Amazon's recent prime day sale.  My mom has been using it and she found it friendly enough. As she isnt very well versed with technology, this coming from her is a huge plus. I found the camera quality to be decent and battery quality to be very good. It's user friendly and comes with decent headphones (design is similar to apple's) for which I was pleasantly surprised. For this price, Oppo has delivered a winner for sure. Go for it.

  Pros:1. 2 sims + microsd provision2. Finger print and face recognition is quick3. Battery is a definite advantageCons:1. Bulky especially after putting the case provided with it2. Screen isn't appealing, in case you used sAMOLED then won't like it a lot3. Back prone to scratches4. Screen guard has some extra edges, not very professionally done but studrdy overall5. This model / IMEI isn't recognized by amazon or flipkart when you look for exchanging phone, so you are stuck with this phone

  I bought the redmi note 3 , 3.5 years ago for the same cost. And upgraded it to this now.The difference is amazing. Mobiles get much much faster every generation than any other computer.I really like the fluidity. And the floating windows for multi tasking.On the downside, being adslr user,I was upset at no raw photo option for both cameras. Using 3rd party apps will give access to primary cam only with raw support. Hoping bbk will fix this.All in all very amazing little beast.

  The phone is excellent in terms of all features. Excellent touch, easy to operate, good camera quality. The only thing that needs to be evaluated is the uages of the tasks. The phone seems to get slow on daily operation and memory seems to be a constant challenge even with 4 GB. Probably a higher one will be better since I use a lot of apps.

"
"

  The phone is fantastic and its features also Is decent for the price compared what I have paid.Good in conditions of battery life camera quality and even looks wiseWho are all looking a phone for normal usage this is the best phone.Finally Good phone

"

  Everything thing is great about it, we must buy it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Picture quality awesome.  Audio is outstanding.  Watching Netflix on phone made simple for me in regards to sound.  Must buy.  Got it at 6999 with exchange

  I used Oppo A5 2020 before.. but unfortunately display broke due to my fault... Hence bought same phone again as I liked it.. Excellent design and display, very good battery back up but only back draw is no fast charger. Main Back Camera is decent as it is only 12 mp but still no complaints.Overall value for money compared to other phones available.

"
"

  The quality is not upto mark at this price range. Realme and redmi are offering better value for money phones. Else go with Samsung or infinix.

"
"

  Good mobile working perfectly.. in this price it is good . I buyed 2 of them .. 2 good performance... camera good quality.. fingerprint good ... sound good. Touch is soft... all performance of phone is good...

  I used to be a fan of Samsung and Redmi. Believe me, Oppo has changed my outlook completely. I am awestruck by the quality of design and performance of the phone. The battery life is great.
