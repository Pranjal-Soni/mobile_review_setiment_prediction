  Here my product review after usage of 2 week.Pros:Design and built quality - superb.Display - Smoothness and view is very impressiveFinger print sensor and face unlock working  perfect.Rear camera - Good as considering the price.Ram management and multitasking - Just ok. Without any new applications it's consuming 1.8 gb.Call quality very fineCons:Gaming - Mobile heating and lagging when you playing high graphics gameBattery - 5020mAh battery. Moderate performFor charging it's take 2.4 hrs per day from 0 to 100. I think MI mentioned just for advertisement.Macro camera - useless featureFront camera - AverageUi is fine but consuming more ramMany pre-installed application could not able to delete ( Mi app).FinalNormal user you can go (If you are ok to charge twice a day).If you are a game addict this product not at all suitable for you.Note: I am requesting replacement for my 1st mobile due to heating issue.Received 2nd one has battery draining issue. I am really disappointed to charge twice a day ( 5hrs per day). I suggest please buy some other brand don't waste your money like me.

  My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.

  Very nice Phone.. smooth performance.. charge service decent.. screen quality superb.. sound ok.. but body vibration issue is here.. in speaker mode or at time of calling body vibration present.. no notification light.. overall decent performance at this price.. phone support only 18 watt fast charge. But charger support 22.5 watt..

  Worst mobile... Ordered mobile on August 03 and received on 22nd and looking at mobile display is good but it switched off itself and not working even though if I tried to charge it's not charging... It was completely dead no power in mobileI received a defect piece then I try to return the mobile nobody is coming for pickup from Amazon and no refund option.Buying mobile in Amazon is a worst decision.So again after multiple follow ups someone From Amazon picked up the phone to return but it's not updated yet in app Or no further communication has been updated from Amazon. I called Amazon customer service care for the the same... He was like just woke up from sleep(mooning) and asked me to wait for on hold and he never came back to talk to me. I felt strange and call was disconnected.It's a strange behavior from Amazon I have been regular nd authorized customer for Amazon since  over the years.

  Totally impressed by the built and looks. For 13k I thought of getting realme 6i but the stocks barely last..!So I decided to get this phone. The phone is great and smooth. Gaming experience is also good but not as good as g90t.G85 is a decent processor with great daily life performance!If 12k is your budget go for it..Or 13k..realme 6i and 14k... Go for poco m2. Scarlet red looks stunning!!

  Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy

  Really Disappointed.""Made In China"" product!No ""Made in India by Redmi"" ? (the reason, I selected Redmi. but disappointed)Giving '1star' because,no '0star' option is there!!!![1. Giving 1star to 'made in china'. 2. Not reviewing for 'Quality & all']

"
"

  Looks premium and mi claims that it has quite a lot of features. Has a better IR blaster for remote accessibility. Only the camera is the best in the price range and other aspects it‚Äôs a Piece of shit.Kindly don‚Äôt buy Becoz it‚Äôs worth only for 8-9k Move to Samsung or any other phone. Fedup with the performance of the phone in the very first day. The 2stars are only for the camera Quality and IR blaster. Phone lags much and Gaming performance is too poor and way of handling this phone requires a lot of patience as it loads for longer time for some of the app details. Battery last better and Camera quality is good that‚Äôs all. Not worthy for 13.5k.Pls don‚Äôt buy it if you expect performance from this phone or if you think you can have better features phone.

  I brought this phone. Flash is not working properly. No intensification in flash. It working like touch is on. I complained to customer care. They sent AC repairman. I said he is AC repairman they said he is all in one. He just reset the phone and said now it works well but there is no change in previous result and the one after reset.

  I got defected charger in box but I have got my replacement satisfied with my product thanks amazon five star thanks

  I brought this phone for my youtube channel review,I thinks that it's a great part product for me because it's Four cameras on the back, punch-hole on the front , camera is perfect, It's me changed my status and one of the best phone i ever had review in last few days  phone capacity 128GB killer memory, Good battery it last 1 to 2 days with normal used. However, Mobile legend has a lot of frame drop when you set it into High Graphic but still manageable when you set to medium graphic. So sad, I thought this is much better compared to lasted redmi phones,The quad-camera setup is almost the same as on the Note 9S but with one small difference - the 5MP f/2.4 camera has been swapped for a 2MP f/2.4 one with autofocus, which is a very welcome feature because it makes macro photography that much easier.The main camera has been borrowed - 48MP with f/1.8 aperture as well as the ultra-wide unit - 8MP with f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide's sensor is quite small measuring at 1/4.0"" with 1.12¬µm. And, of course, the 2MP depth sensor, which serves more of an aesthetic purpose than functional one.Ôº∂ÔΩâÔΩÑÔΩÖÔΩè ÔΩíÔΩÖÔΩÉÔΩèÔΩíÔΩÑÔΩâÔΩéÔΩáUnfortunately, the phone supports video recording only up to 1080p at 30 fps. There aren't many modes in which you can shoot in either. A cinematic aspect ratio is available to add some dramatic effect to the video, but that's pretty much it.The Full HD video itself is a bit on the soft side and the dynamic range seems a bit too narrow. You can't see anything in the shadows and clouds in the sky are just a tad brighter than they should.

  Selfie Camera Not As Expected-Picture Quality Very Bad, Appearing Small Dots On Entire Face During And After Selfie Clicks.Rear Camera :Rear Camera Picture Quality Nice But Detailing Not good.

  Product is not super value for money. Back panel plastic quality not so good.Camera perform great in daylight condition and ok in low light.I have also note 9 Pro I think that is super value for money under 14000 if you budget permit then go for it. By paying extra 2000 rupees for redmi note 9 Pro you got great build quality with back side glass, UFS 2.1 rom for storage and to great camera.

"
"

  Very good phone powered with battery and performance at this Price .But the problem is the Camera clarity.I compared it with MI A3 48 MP camera with this and was very Disappointed...No other problems

  why made in china is written on phone sticker and also on box. as your ad show it is made in india then why made in china is there..

  Phone Performance overroll good but charging speed is too slow it's take more time to charge my phone 35 to 100 percent charge on a 3 hours i am not satisfied.

  #Redmi #Note9 (6/128) is a great phone for both normal use gaming and productivityHighly satisfied with the mobile.Awesome looks Superb.Quad camera looks superb.Highly recommended mobile.Battery backup is goodDisplay quality goodAnd performance as per processor is awesome as #MI #Note9 is best.

"

  When you think about mi, it is best in market as per processor and memory but brand mark of china put your moral down,This is good handset with trademark of made in India - Big Reason to buy this.Pros:Quad Camera at this low rangeHigh Internal Memory and RAM.Very sleek design and thin as compared to other old mobiles of mi family.Processor is also good, no hanging issues while playing gamesCons:Signal strength struggles in every type of SIM Card, which defeat the very purpose of Mobile phone.Built quality is very bad, it will absolutely break if it felt down.Plastic frames seems to be very made of cheap quality which doesn't made grip without cover.

  PROS- 5000 batteryAVARAGE- processor( the mediatek processor hit a lot)CONS-CAMERA( it is fake, works like normal 16 MP camera, it is just for advertisement).CHARGER( though company says it is of 22.5 W, it takes a lot of time to charge) .ADVERTISE( you all know how the adds disturb you every time).

"
"

  Why it's made in china in advertising made in india

"

  Best product for homeschooling students and this e who are new users. It's a great combo and manages every tasks vet well . The helio g85 chipset is almost equivalent to Snapdragon 712 . If you are a student and buying a new phone it's the no. 1 preference. Please don't listen to those who say this isn't a great phone . Believe me I have used it. Now if you are planning to play games more than 2 or 3 and pubg. Hours then not only this phone but flagship phones will also heat up a bit and lag. Take care of the phone and this will be of great choice to all.

"

  Go for it mid range buget phone...

  When I Charging that time mobile is heating more . So, please contact me  or return this product

  Positive parts1. Performance is best.2. Multitasking3. Screen display4. Protection5. Sound6. CameraNeed to improve by xiomi (negative)1. Unwanted app and banned app is still use in this like clean master, etc must have remove option or fixed it with update.2. Price is little on higher side.3. Why not given 90hz refresh4. Colors availability5. Night photos not up to the mark.Overall good phone. unwanted app must remove by manufacturer as guideline by govt of india.

"
"

  Camera quality is very poor. Other features are also very low. Overall it is low product in a very high price.

  I am writing this after a week usage1. Front camera sucks and blur the photos2. Slow device, I tried opening saved video from gallery but it takes time to do it3. Profille on Instagram and Facebook are not visible clearly4. While watching videos on YouTube, I can feel slowness and clarity issueRaised issue with Amazon and returing the device.Thanks Amazon for helping a genuine customer.

"
"

  I hope I wouldn't need to edit my comment if it's too early or after I am more experienced with the mobile , but using it for few days after purchasing it recently I would say that it's a beautiful phone with a brilliant display quality and size , faster performance and a more than satisfactory camera quality , not to mention of its huge 128 GB storage capacity. The battery is good and lasts sufficiently according to usage.The only issue I found that it is pre-installed with a 'Get Apps' app from where you have to download and update your apps while Google Play Store seems not to work at all in it. You will not even find many Google apps in the pre-installed app. Besides that you will be consuming your internet data faster with this phone , you know that.

  Budget phone best in segment..Coming to Amazon service Amazon has completely money minded now.. it doesn't allow us to ask some questions also.. it's concentrating only for prime customers.. normal customers it's a throwaway service.. delivery updates not proper adding card payment is also not user-friendly.. my bank is giving EMI for me.. Amazon shows your card is not eligible for EMI.. such a cheap treatment for non prime customers.. & one more thing normal customers will never get notifications of flash sale even though we have reminded so many times n subscribed for updates.. coming to the quiz part & spin n win it's completely useless n just a time pass games.. thanks for pathetic service..

  Phone is good but front & rear camera is not good photo clicked by 48 mp camera is look like 5 mp camera photo.

"

  Waste product...i hate amazon because of selling non worthy product to me....mobile is over heating and battery draining too fast.no network and unato hear calls properly.in same place i kept other mobiles and cross checked them.

"

  Made in China product delivered to me instead of made in india.This is really not expected. Advertising as it is made in india but sending china product.This is one kind of fraudulent. This happened 2 times.

"

  Very fast delivery..loved the mobile...

"
"

  I will go directly to pros and consProsBatteryRear cameraHelio processor is goodConsBulky and thickFront cameraDisplayOverall it's a nice phone in this range I bought it for 12k so with this price range it's a ok ok phone won't expect much in terms of performance wise but u can consider buying it if you are looking for a budget phone.....and a mi lover like me:)

"
"

  Average phone. Good for price. Camera sensor is very poor quality. If you take large 48 MP picture, you can see the dead pixels in the zoomed photo. They glitter like stars. Even if you cover the camera and take photo, these pixels come out white colours.Other than that, everything seems nice. I used a program to uninstall all the crap Xiaomi bloatware from my phone, (like mipay, cleaner, micommunity, etc).As a result I don't see any ads.I play asphalt 9, game runs smoothly in playable fps.Processor Helio G85 is same as G80, nothing extra.Mi UI is crap. My last phone was Mi A1, which had stock android. Can't understand why Xiaomi, oppo, etc spend money in developing these crappy skins. Stock android is best.Final thoughts: Good phone to use for 1 year, 2 at most. Price could have been 1k less.Looking forward to buy pixel 4a next year when price comes down.

"
"

  I ordered it from the first flash sale and was delivered at 26th july. Best at this budget,Battery and Charging is cool,little bit heat generated,while high usage due to polycarbonate back i can feel it easily i think,rear cam is superb,front cam is good at this price, OS is decent,waiting to receive MIUI 12 update..Overall i rate 9 out of 10 !MIUI 12 received a month back..but heating has been increased while gaming and charging

"
"

  The phone is beautiful looks stunning works fast thanks MI for making this budget friendly phone I was planning to buy redmi 9 prime but it was barely available it usually gets sold out in seconds so I increased my budget and took redmi note 9It's really good at 12k with amazing performance camera is awesome night mode is awesome charge really fast I bought this phone for my mother and she is really vry happy so if ur pocket allows you to buy for 12k go for it if u have 10k tight budget then wait for redmi 9 prime sale that phn is exactly same as this one jst with a bit camera differenceOver all I'll give 4.5 out of 5 to this phoneThanks xaomiü•∞

  Totally disappointed in slow motion video recording. Have a look at the recorded show motion video!!!!. I was trying to return the Redmi note 9 but this Amazon is not giving option to return and I fedof calling them and following up. Please don't buy any product from Amazon.

  ¬†I bought this in the sale and was very happy that I got in offer price, it worked very good the day we received but from next day we experienced wifi connectivity issue (wifi connects and disconnects by itself, I had done couple of phone resets but the issue didn't resolve & i raised the issue with Amazon customer service and they appointed mobile inspection service the next day. A person came and inspected but couldn't resolve and updated the issue as it is and same day received a call from the Amazon customer service and told they will replace with a new phone and received a replace but this time also we experienced the same issue, and now we are waiting for the person who will come for inspection to check the issue. It was the same and we asked for refund and refunded at last. Thank you Amazon. If this was the issue with Flipkart they would not refund and tell us to got to the service center. Amazon is the bestüëç

  Super mobile....Camera quality better ( front and back)..sound effect super..Battery backup super..Dispaly quality ok..Reverse Charging super..i charged blutooth headset give better charging..Reverse charging working...Overall better phone

"

  Don't purchase it guys, I am not happy about front facing camera, it states 12 mp but works like 5 mp camera, not expected from Xiaomi for camera quality. Rest phone is good and being a big battery phone fells light weight and also fells good to hold.Lets see if update is given regarding the front camera issues.

  BEST BUDGET PHONE IN THIS RANGEBATTERY LIFE IS VERY GOOD, when unpacked, the beast had 60% alreadyLESS BLOATWARE is nice thing with the Android One & MIUI 11 but I got instant MiUi 12 so very happyIt is very slim & very big easy to hold & gives good grip but menu is inaccessible sometimes because its very big phoneIn the box they gave pin a fast charger usb 3.0 & plastic transparent cover as well. It also has nice screenguard without any printings on itVery impressed by looks the glossy back makes it looks rich & royal. I am suggesting it for you guys go for it

"
"

  It is really an Undisputed champion.But arctic white colour disappoint me..Other then that it is flawless

"
"

  I'm aware that when your colour mode is set to auto, the contrast can get really high in sunlight to make the display easier to see. I'm personally not a fan of this feature, so I turned it off on my previous phone.Now I've got the Redmi Note 9  with MIUI 11, but even after setting the colours to default, the contrast still changes in sunlight. What's worse, it tends to ""spas out"" when in a car for instance. It seems that the sensor/software is confused whether or not the contrast should be increased or not, so in the end the display starts to almost flash by continuously lowering and upping the contrast.I've tried restarting the phone, and turning the auto colour feature on and off. The problem still persists. Not sure if this is a bug or not. And if it's not a bug, is there a way to turn the feature off completely?

  Very best smartphone under the budget segments with best camera, performance, display and battery backup

  This product is made in China, even though Amazon claims that it is made in India. This phone also contains lot of banned apps like cleaner and other which you can not uninstall.We did not expect from Amazon that they will cheat the customers by wrong promotions of Made in India.

Battery drained very fastTechnician also come they say yes sir ur product is defective but they give report that product has no problem.I'm really very disappointed with this product or AmazonVery very bad service provide by Amazon

"
"

  I took this phone because it says ""made in india"". But actual phone has made in china.The built quality, screen resolution is not good, it's poor quality. It's just marketing tricks to release in schedule time and given configuration.I have motorola phone, using it from two years. With 42mp camera. That resolution is far better than thus redmi.I suggest don't purchase redmi.

"
"

  Don't recoment it this is not 48 mp camera waste ur money phone struking and charging take too much time

"
"

  MI has just retained the strategy fash sale marketing to sell this phone. Which is not worthy at all. Performance of the chipset is not good. For this price we can better move on to M series which have a better display.Pros:Camera quality is good.Fast charge is good.Cons:Display is not as good as compared to other phones in this same segmentHeating up when playing gamesBattery back up is just ok. It stands for 1.5 days for normal usage.

  The phone is annoyingly slow. It says 4GB processor but if was easily beaten by some older 2GB processor phones. 48mega pixel camera is for name sake. A Samsung/ Moto /OnePlus 20odd megapixel camera is better than this phone. Highly disappointed in this Redmi phone. Battery charging speed seems to be a decade behind 3 hours required for full charge c30% charge per hour..

  I am having both realme 6i and redmi note 9.I must say,always go for note 9.Realme 6i battery is really a shit.its draining more quickly when compared to note9.This is due to its 90hz display.Also there are heating issues while charging in realme  6i.Redmi note 9 is better in camera on good light conditions when compared to realme6i.Moreover realme  6i comes with 18 watt in box charger and redmi note 9 comes with 22.5 watt in box.even though real me 6i supports 30watt charging ,who's gonna buy that 30 watt charger that costs 1,400 rs.When coming into screen protection realme6i comes with an older version of gorilla glass whereas redmi note 9 comes with latest corning gorilla glass 5 (both camera and screen are protected).There are chances for real me 6i camera to get scratches as it is not protected using gorilla glass whereas note 9' s camera is protected with corning gorilla 5 glass.Final words: if you really worry about battery life then never ever go for realme 6i.A feature called 90 hz display in realme 6i drains it battery quickly.Its better to describe realme  6i as 'fast draining phone' rather than 'fast charging phone'.Guys don't believe in reviewers words as they say good review in favour of the mobile company which gives them better amount.Its better to ask your friends who brought this phone rather than watching review videos.

  Received phone yesterday. First impression is ok ok. Phone case should have been given transparent. It comes in grey shade so overrides phone color. Observed little lags in some applications. First battery charge took 4 hours for 10 to 95. Phone which supports 22.5W charging only accepts 18W. Doesnt make sense. Since this is budget phone dont expect too much but atleast battery charging issue should be fixed.Note on Amazon Delivery - Considering the ongoing situation, I can undestand Amazon prefer for contactless delivery. But delivery person didnt call me at the time delivery. He directly handed my shipment to security. When I reached customer care, I was pointed that, I had received message and mail about delivery. But I was not satisfied with the answer, since I was expecting call from delivery person for some reason. These days I feel Amazon Customer Support has lost the friendliness.

"
"

  Camera stopped working after inserting sim card. Amazon delayed my order 5 days late and delivered it 2nd sep which was supposed to deliver on 28th Aug. And replacement window closed on 5th sep. Called amazon customer support but they said windows closed hence cant replace your item. Soon going to complain in consumer court against Amazon as this is totally wrong and I wish that they should replace my order soon.

  Here's my review after using Redmi Note 9 for 3days.Perfect phone for a perfect price. Camera quality is just awesome.If I was to say about the battery, I would like to mention that it doesn't gives much backup. It drains faster. By 10:30pm that is before going to bed at night, I checked the buttery ‚ÑÖ & it was 41%. When I checked it on morning by 5:30am after waking up, battery % was showing 32%.Without using the phone, 10‚ÑÖ charge was gone within 7hrs. And also the super fast charging is useless. The phone takes 2.5hrs to charge from 0% to 100‚ÑÖ.Another weak point is that, it is MADE IN CHINA.‚òπÔ∏è

  Updating my review after 22 daysPros :1. Battery -5000mAh2. Display 6.53inch3. Processor G854. Fast reaction5. CameraCons :1. Front camera isn't upto the mark2. Battery could be 6000mAh3. Display brightness isn't better,can't see in sunlight.Adding these after using 1 monthüëá4. TOO much heating problem5. If you're a gamer then it isn't for you bcz also too much lagging problem.6. Battery is draining too fast as didn't expectedI'LL RECOMMEND POCO M2 THAT HAVE1. 6GB &64GB INTERNAL2. CAMERAS ARE GOOD3. BATTERY IS 5000mAh4. G80 PROCESSOR5. SCREEN 5.53""AND PRICE IS ONLY 10,999 üòá.you're GOING TO SAVE AROUND 1K WITH QUALITY PHONE FEATURES.

  Good product...worth of money...must buy...one draw back is I updated the android 12 version within a day after receiving the product....

"
"

  The look of the phone and color are awesome, for the first time I am using other than black and grey colors in phone.Camera - Selfie is amazing, back camera good but not up to the mark. But, if you select 48MP and took a photo, it is very good.Charging - Super fast, it took less than an hr from 20% - full charge.Weight - When you have case on it, you will feel something we are holding. Of-course every mobile will weigh, when you put the case on it.Performance - Since 2 days I am using it, it's really fast and want to observe more to write about it more.Display - it's large and very clear. Its an edge-to-edge screen and even we can change the settings of display to reduce the display size.Overall, if you are looking for best phone under 12K INR, blindly you can go for it.

  Nice at this price rAngeAll is good only battery drain in 8hrs after using heavy usage

"
"

  Nice phone but the front camera was not to goodWe all need to take a good selfie in our phone but in this phone selfie camera is not goodOne more thing is that the  charging of phone is not better because it takes may be to charge the phone  0 to 100% it takes approx 3 hrsI know that one thing in the box the charger is of 22.5 w fast charging support but the phone was only support 18w chargingIn may words  18 w is also good to charge red mi note 9 but  this phone is taking to much time to  complete charge aprrox 3 hrs

"

  I like this product but camera quality not satisfy.

"
"

  Excellent MobilePros :Bigger DisplayBigger BatteryExcellent CamerasSmooth PerformanceCons :18.5 W Fast charging need to unlock 22.5W Support..Everything is Good ...

"
"

  Display is good. Camera is not upto the mark. When taking video both sound and video are not in sync. Battery is getting drained off so quickly. For a video of 4 mins battery driained from 78% to 66%. For 11 mins usage battery drained off from 66% to 64% with WIFi On. But not used any kind of internet consuming application. Just done some navigation in the phone. Software is not tested properly as there are lot of graphical glitches while using the phone. Hope in next UI update it will be fixed.

"
"

  Nice product short range multi functioning at a instance with no lag ..performance above average .....

"
"

  Everything is best in this phone according to the price and its the best in this budget. The battery lasts for 2days with medium usage. It has 22.5 W charger in the box but supports only 18W. The Charing speed is not so impressive. The cameras are very nice and have improved more after software updates. Gaming performance is decent in this price. The user experience has improved more after MIUI 12 update and there are no banned apps. Overall I recommend it to everyone.

"
"

  The quality of the product is not good as we had not thought the notification light is not there when charging or any notification comes. The quality of the camera is also good as we thought it was not.

"
"

  this is a great phone for both normal use gaming and productivitypros:1)great design even though the back is made up of polycarbonate material feels premium and strong2)no hang issues so far very fast3)videos are colorful and vibrant4)1080p display is very good and feels like a amoled display5)touch feels good6) charging is super fast and battery backup is goodcons:1) the main issue is that the banned apps are preinstalled like secuirity mi browser...etc2) camera is not good as expectedoverall conclusion is that, buy this phone if u want a premium phone on a low budget but if u can spend a couple of thoousands go for its higher versions like pro and pro max and maybe samsung as well!!

"
"

  If u are a gamer then plzz don't buy this.....Pubg lags very much u can't even play like normal...but overall camera and battery is nice...

  Super look.Elegant.Lovely colour.Super camera.I really loved this.I didn't expected that I will able to get this phone.I am trying to buy this for last 2 weeks.But I didn't get it. So i lost my hope.And tried the last flash sale with no hope.But fortunately I got this phone with my desired colour.Really liked purchasing from amazon.I didn't get phone even from mi store.But got this from amazon. Really unexpected. Thank you seller and amazon.

"
"

  i bought this phone in amazon prime day sell and it took around 10 days to arrive, now the pros of the phone i only notice good battery life,sound and screen quality but cons are it took almost 2.30 HRS TO full charge then what is the use of 18w fast charging comes with 22.5w charger its completely waste and the camera quality is also normal it does not looks like that you take a shot from a 48mp camera so if anyone is thinking of high quality snaps then dont buy it you can buy it only for its battery life and screen quality

"
"

  1. This product is Made in China.2. Heating a lot just after 10min of usage.3. Bloatware4. They promised that they will remove Mi Security, Mi Cleaner, etc but still exists. They lied.5. Front Facing camera is below average.6. Network issues as usual like other Mi phones. Not great at fetching the network signal.7. Feels bulky in hand.Finally regretting my purchase. I'm a Redmi phone user for the past 2 years.

  Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: Design and displayThe smartphone comes with what the company calls the Aura Balance design. It is the same design that Redmi Note 9 Pro and Redmi Note 9 Pro Max features. Back of the phone has a glossy finish making it reflective. Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes in three colour options: Pebble Grey, Arctic White, and Aqua Green. The review unit we got was the Pebble Grey colour variant. The phone looks good and sturdy, and will not disappoint you in terms of design.  You will also see a rectangular-shape cut out on the rear side housing the camera bump along with the fingerprint scanner. LED flash is placed beside the camera system. To the right side of the phone are the volume control buttons along with the power button. The SIM card tray is placed at the left side. Redmi Note 9 offers 2+1 card slots -- one for microSD card and two for SIM card each.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 is equipped with 3.5mm headphone jack placed at the bottom edge. The phone comes with a USB Type-C charger. The charging port is also placed at the bottom along with speaker grills and a microphone. On the top edge of the phone is the IR blaster.  The smartphone features a 6.53-inch punch-hole display with 1080x2340 FHD+ resolution. The punch-hole housing the front camera is placed at the top-right corner, thus it hardly obstruct the viewing experience on Redmi Note 9. The display is a strong point of the phone. It provides sharp colours with adequate brightness. Viewing angles are good too.Despite its glossy back, the phone offers a firm grip. The smartphone feels sturdy and durable and can be easily used with a single hand.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: PerformanceRedmi Note 9 comes powered by MediaTek Helio G85 octa-core processor with a maximum frequency of 2.0GHz, a GPU frequency of 1000MHz, and up to 6GB of LPDDR4X RAM. There is a 4GB RAM variant of the phone as well. The handset comes in two storage options: 64GB and 128GB. The MediaTek processor can easily handle day-to-day usage without giving you much to complain about.Considering, Redmi Note 9 is a budget phone, our hopes were not much high about the speed and performance of the device. The loading speed of the apps was reasonably good. Switching between multiple apps was easy. Gaming experience too will not be a disappointment. However, there were heating issues with the device after prolonged gaming or long streaming hours. But again, that‚Äôs acceptable at the price point.  Xiaomi has packed Android 10 with a layer of MIUI 11 on the top in the Redmi Note 9 phone. As with other Xiaomi phones, this device too comes with much pre-installed bloatware. These include apps like the Mi Credit, Helo, Mi Community, Zili and more. Some of the apps have already been banned by the Indian government. One can always uninstall them as per their own choice. What struck us is that the phone suggests you download a few more apps even during the setup process. But that again is an individual‚Äôs choice to install or not.Moving on, the phone‚Äôs UI is typical of any Redmi phone. If you are using a Redmi phone, you may find it easy to use the phone simply because of the familiarity. Also, you get spam notifications on the device.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 comes with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock technology for security and privacy of the device. Both worked well for us. The unlocking speed with both these security features was acceptable and just to the phone‚Äôs price.Xiaomi Redmi Note 9: CameraIn continuation of the trend these days, Xiaomi has introduced a quad lens camera system at the back with the Redmi Note 9. The phone offers a 48MP primary rear camera paired with three other sensors- a wide-angle lens, a macro lens and a depth lens. Again, there is not much new about the camera app and its UI. However, the company has added a separate Documents mode to Redmi Note 9 which can be used to scan important documents and papers. Considering the CamScanner app is no longer available, this is an important addition.The 48MP camera does justice to the object being captured. It is able to retain details and true colours more or less. However, the noise creeps in when you use the wide-angle lens. The sensor offers 8MP Ultra wide sensor with 118-degree field-of-view. Photos clicked were low in quality and lack detail.

  Powerful Gaming processor. Superb game experience on pubg and CODSuperb battery performance, 22 w charging is not fast as expected.48 main cam and night mode is good.Low light performance is bad

  I faced charging issue's it will took 6 hour  for full charge with 22w adopter.And they said this is hd resolution display but I didn't feel hd in it and phone will lagging after 1 to 2 hour of usedFinally my  opinion is please don't buy it for punctual camera just go for little higer price 14000 to 20000 will get a best one.

  Waited for more than a month to get Redmi 9 prime or Redmi Note 9 just because of this SALE dramaüò† and a local shopkeeper is selling this phone at a higher price(300 - 400 ‚Çπ extra than actual price). He has all the variants and colors and we as a customer are not able to get even a single color/variant üëéüèªMobile brands (Redmi, Realme etc.) Should seriously think of this problem üôà

  As of now#This mobile is not for gamersG 85 processor is performing same as G80 and half in G90. It lags, yeah only true gamer knows that.*Poor optimization (May this fix in upcoming updates)*Disappointing fast charging, it takes 2.32 hrs for a full charge (22.5 w charger given but it supports only 18w charging)Pros:*Heating problem sorted out*Descent camera,good looking body*Good battery backup****If u can pay 500 to 1000 more just go for poco m series it's 100% better than this mobile in performance,charging,backup.*****If u r a gamer go with poco m series and realme 6i which is far better in performance and excellent in quick charging.Finally note 9 is not undisputed champion. It's just a champ for household users and for normal usage.

"
"

  Its features are good but the only thing bothering me is the apps and storage. There are so many useless apps which I don't use at all and the phone won't allow me to delete it!I checked the storage and I found out that the useless apps all consume almost 20 gb of my storage! My phone only has 128 gb storage but I can only use 110 gb storage. Please do consider this............

  Got defective piece, speaker is not working. Please rethink twice before buying this mobile. Better go for Samsung or hour within this range.

  Hey guys without wasting coming to the point. I didnt like this product at all reason listed below.(1) - In one day use I saw that battery is not upto mark, it drains swiftly.(2) - Camera so called 48mp is poor than realme 5i or even than redmi 8. Camera flash is very low. Display is not smooth.(3) - No charger cable was there in box.(4) - packaging was not good.And the last I was expecting made in India product and am given made in China mobile.Pathetic.

"
"

  Please dont buy, otherwise you will feel like cheated.Its very big bug miss from Redmi side.There is issue with MI phone front camera.There is big issue with the front camera during video making.... It is not able to focus.Even i am highlighting same issue to Amazon and MI.Amazon is saying there is no issue as per shared by their technician and they are not addressing my issue.MI team is saying just reset the phone and after that they are saying 13MP can give this much only.

  #Mi #Note9 4 GB RAM 128 GB Storage* Best at this budget.* Battery and Charging is cool, little bit heat generated.* Rear camera is superb & front cam is good at this price.* OS is decent, waiting to receive MIUI 12 update.* Super phone quality* Good performance* Big, bright screen* Overall I rate 9 out of 10

  After using two week I am writing this review the word undisputed champion really apt for this mobile.1) camera is pretty decent with 48 megapixel.2) battery beast3) fast charger4) display is pretty cool.Over all I can say it's a budget champion at this price of 12k.Thank you Amazon for providing this superb product.

"

  Bought this coz nothing else was available as all phones are on selected sale dates.I got the mi ui 12 update on this, phone does show signs of sluggish behavior, after the update.There are many who have reported defects in the redmi note 9 series phones with related to camera accumulating dust and wifi issues,I have not got such issues yet, what i have faced is some touch issues on browser or while scrolling youtube, sometimes auto scrolls or blocks my scroll. started happening after the miui12 udpate.Battery draining faster after miui 12.Charger is 22 watts but phone is charging at 18 watt only, to be udpated by MI by software as per reports.it takes 2 hrs to fully charge.As far as phone is concerned, its ok , camera video quality is bad coz its not sturdy it keeps readjusting focus.It does click good pics.Day to day work on this phone was good, heavy mails would render and open faster. mi ui is customizable, you can hide the notch.There is no notification light.Processing is fast. but not a gaming phone .....period !!!!Pubg was sluggish and few others would crash. may be mediatek processor is not as good as snapdragon.Or that mediatek decided g85 was a stupid release and introduced 90 and 95 series.g85 doesnt have any upper hand to g80 in any aspect, so you could prefer redmi 9 prime or poco which is on g80 and 2k cheaper.Speaker volume is low and display is not that bright,Would not recommend to buy this, there are more options available.

"
"

  Value for money device:1. Beautiful display and design, position of the selfie camera is perfect almost full view experience.2. Performance is good, PUBG runs smoothly after MIUI12 update.3. Rear camera is superb, specially the ""Pro colour"" mode makes picture more attractive.4. Battery stays upto 2 days..Dislike:1. Charging speed, takes more than 2 hours

"
"

  What a wonderful device. Loved it's UI, touch and camera. Looks premium and videos looks great in 6.53 fhd display. This is latest release note series after note 8. This costs only 12k as of now and note 8's price has hiked to 12.7k so an sane buyer would grab this opportunity with open hands.Honest review from a Redmi love.

"
"

  I did not notice any slowdowns while using the Redmi Note 9  for a week. With 4GB of RAM, multitasking isn't an issue, and I could switch between multiple apps very easily. I found face recognition as well as the fingerprint scanner to be very quick to unlock the smartphone.The display has good viewing angles and gets bright when outdoors.Camera performance is great :)It is a very good smartphone for the price. The performance it offers is adequate, and should keep many budget phone buyers happy. Its long battery life helps you go on throughout the day without worrying about charging. If you want a good all-rounder and a clean user interface, this is the one to go for.

"
"

  Review after a week of usage-> Good battery life, i'm getting 2 day battery life(scrolling through feeds,chatting,2,3 hrs of Spotify,1/2 day of netflix).->Takes up to 1hr for full charge-> stock camera quality not up to mark, adding gcam could improve it.->Good sound quality, front speakers are excellent too.->No network problems.->Running on miui 12, hopping android 11 will be available soon.->No stuttering while doing casual tasks, i cant comment on gaming experience since i haven't done any till now

"
"

  It is a fantastic phone for its price. It has good haptics, fast fingerprint and face lock, great display, good connectivity, miui12, great service across the country and a great back too. Some might say that add 1000 to your budget and buy and get realme 6i and then again someone will some add another 1000 and get samsung m21, as it has a bigger battery and a AMOLED display and this chain keeps on going.So just buy whatever your budget lets you too.You'll not be dissapointed.And remember ""It's not that the good phones have got cheap. It's the cheap phones that are now good.""

  i again made a mistake....thought Media tek has now doing something with their processors....but again it proved me wrong...Snapdragon processors are much better guys...some good points1.Battery is awesome ...its back is great on standby2.camera is ok ok.Not natural colours its over saturated3.Look is acceptable at this price rangenow the only bad thing is1. its processor ...although it is clocked at 2 ghz but this phone is definitely not for gaming purpose.even clash of clans is not wrking smooth forget pubg.for running pubg you have to on the game turbo and still game lags a bit ..frame drops are very high sometimes.....so guys its upto you ...never trust a media tek processor for gaming...and specially under 15 k phones...........this is my review after 2 weeks.....after the first system update all the above issues have now been resolved....battery optimisation for stand by is now awesome......and biggest of all...pubg runs smooth without game turbo..i am happy now ...peace

  Redmi note9Surely it can be better if it had a Snapdragon processor in it but According to my personal usage mediatek is not so good for long term usageBattery life-Phone's battery life is pretty good and the fast charger makes really difference at this price range a phone is comming with such charger greatCamera-Well According to me personally it's not a camera oriented phone so you could nit depend on this for pro photography well the camera is also not that bad and selfie camera is also goodProcessLook and feel is nice it's juat like note9pro and looks great in handOverall not a long term phone

  Am writing this review after 5 days of usage.Everything seems to be going in favor until i found the issue with WiFi connection. This issue is very strange as it displays connected to wifi but no internet. This is very weird.Looks like this issue is with all redmi phones as my redmi note 4 shows similar strange behavior. Be careful if you use wifi more than mobile data.

"
"

  Amazon is advertising this product as an ace, but the reality is far from what they say for the quality. Within a month from buying, the device starts to hang miserably including many other minor issues. The other issue I have been facing is the wifi connectivity. Wifi doesn't works efficiently unless the device is put on airplane mode, and on top of all this, no response from the company. I contacted amazon, but they deny to bear any responsibility. They just wanna sell the products, but with minimal to no cover for any faults/damages. SHAME on AMAZON.THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH BUYING.

"
"

  This product can be considered as a good option for starting mid-range smartphone. Some of the issues and plus points observed are mentioned below:Cons -1. Response of fingerprint sensor is quite slow.2. Processor sometimes throw lag while multitasking.3. Phone color is not at all visible if put on the company provided case.Pros -1. Camera quality is really good. One can take very decent pics provided the availability of proper light.2. Battery backup is not bad. Can support more than 24 hours with full charge.3. MIUI 12 upgrade will surely give a good reel to use it.2.

  After 3days of use I think redmi note9 is awesome features likeYou get dual app like bhim,Google pay,phonepe app.This app have dual space one is user mode another is guest mode.I review 3 basic feature which is battery,screen,and camera1.battery performance is great in 1hrs fully charged.2.screen is little bit disappoint me.3.camera is just like 16mp rear camera and 5mp front facing camera.I ordered this phone after sell of one kidney of my friend,my friend gets rs 65000 and gives me 13000 for this phone.First I bought this phone from 12000,then I bought glass and cover in 650 and rest 350 used for treat .My friend just drink a glass of milk and bread.

"
"

  Fantastic phone.  Value for money! great battery life (I don't see Youtube or do gaming on it, so the battery lasts 3 full days when fully charged).  48 MP camera gives great pictures, crisp, sharp and right colors.  Light weight, sleek.  Phone does not lag.  No heating problems even if  you use talk for long or while charging.Pros - Great design, camera, processor, sleek, easy to hold, fast charging, no lags, no heating problems.Cons - None as of yet.

  Just wastage of money nothing else.. Don't buy this phone by seeing the specifications.. Camera is very cheap .. very poor quality photos .. photos not even worth for 12000 Rs mobile.. Talking about network speed.. i think Redmi itself reduce its network catching power.. i tested this phone with my old LYF mobile.. both having same SIM same network same location.. but LYf gives speed of 4-5mbps and this redmi note 9 still stuck on 1-2 mbps..(tested in same condition) ... and you can't play heavy games like pubg in this.. this is not suitable for pubg... just wastage of money.nothing else... Don't Buy this worst product... Thank you

  Amazon advertising made in India and send Made in China phone.  One time they it by saying we have wrongly send made China phone,  2nd time they said made in phone is not launched yet. But they advertise made in India. Amazon is now not trustable,  even if we go for refund.

  Screen quality and build is pretty ordinary. Samsung M31 provides a much better quality phone at an incremental cost of just 2K with all the features. I think this is the reason they just sell this phone via flash sale so that a user doesn't get time to think.

  Good phone . overall ill say a budget friendly phone . quality wise didn't feel that good . compared to note 8 this one is not good . as if purchased in these colours u will get to see the edges like toys design . back panel is plastic as compared to note 8 which is glass panel. Camera quality better then note 8 . almost same but improved in certain areas in colour contrast.  Overall good budget friendly phone and decent gaming phone . 12k worth it . still redmi note 8 is class .

  The phone is a good one but not true value for money.Camera is good and same as all xiaomi devices in this segment.Speaker sound output is quite low (not suitable for binge watchers). You can only hear dialogues when set to full output.Does not easily fits into hands.Processor is  good. No lags seen so far.Overall a good xiaomi buy but keep expectations low with respect to speaker volume.

"
"

  Faulty mobile phone received.Worst return policy of amazonSeveral times I created a return request but false statement provided by amazon.

"
"

  Superb in speed display is big,sound quality is excellent, feature of its are very nice,bacttary performance is really good,but camera is average that's why I give four star out of five.But according to reid mi note 9 price compair to other mobile in this price I really prefer redmi note 9 .Good one and I specially thanks to amazon for providing this products on no coast emi through different finance thank you amazon.

  I bought the green one but theyDelivered the white but white is more beautiful than green I am so happy with the product screen is very smooth and battery is also good but if we compare vivo and redmi same camera 48mp vivo is best this is also good but there's a very difference between only the companyOverall phone is excellent and so simple to use and sound quality is üëåüèª

  Redmi note 9 phone review after 1-month use.Pros :Build Quality is good.48 MP Camera quality is good.Sound speaker is crisp with good bass.MIUI 12 update is received.We can rely on it for a long time.better than any realme phone.Cons:MIUI has too many bloatwares.MIUI 12 is showing some frame drops.No Audio Enhancement software is installed like Hi-Fi, Dolby, or DTS.Default Equilizer does work for Bluetooth devices.Macro lens and wide-angle lens qualities are worst, looks like cheap camera used.MIUI is showing too many ads.

"
"

  Good looking phone with 5000mah battery... If your main aim is battery and display this is a best choice. Camera is average to decent that you can expect in this price segment. Phone design though looks very premium and nice to hold.UI is easy to use and touch sensitivity is responsive.The phone lasts easily over two to three days for a casual use which is massive. Normal usage lasts more then a day with still half juice remaining.Those who love long battery life will enjoy

  This phone is very good, build quality is awesome, solid processor, screen quality fhd which is very nice, everything is very good, overall value for money. Thanks Amazon.

"
"

  Good phone. I think display colour of note 9 is better than note 9 pro max. I've got MiUi 12 update in note 9. The camera is not awesome, still good. Redmi offers a very high built in quality. Though the body is plastic it doesn't seem like. Overall the phone is good. Best phone for this price. I highly recommend you to buy this.

"
"

  Battery drains fast.Touch sensors are not sensative. Irritating.Heavy in weight.Slow in speed.No notification light.Earlier used redmi note 4, note 7 pro.. but this one is not upto the mark... Average phone as it boasts itself, best in class.Better choices exist in market.Disappointed with its performance.

"
"

  It went to blurred screen just after a week without even subjected to splash of water. Booked an appointment with MI service on Thursday.

  JUST WRITING AFTER 1 WEEK OF USAGE WITH JIO SIM... Phone is excellent scarlet red..Brightness of the screen is very pleasing to the eyes..6 GB 128 GB is working excellent with over 150 apps installed as of now ...  I am not a gamer , I haven't installed any game APPS ....  Battery is charging very fast... Battery is giving me at least 8 hours of screen time for normal browsing & apps usage..  phone speaker volume is very loud but some times with loud speaker sound tone clarity is not there...  Normal phone speaker during call is clear tone clarity...  Everything else is running smoothly without any hitch...ONE THING ABOUT AMAZON ORDERING... THEY DELIVERED IT ON COD ORDER... MY EARLIER PHONE GOT WATER DAMAGED..  COUDNT PAY BECAUSE OF OTP ISSUES...  ALSO I GOT EMAIL ALERT STATING DELIVERY BOY COULDN'T GET MY HOME IN THE AREA & WAS GOING BACK...  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED FROM MY FATHERS PHONE TO GUIDE HIM TO TAKE DELIVERY AT HOME...  I ORDERED THROUGH OTHER SITES BUT AFTER FEW DAYS ALL CANCELLED MY COD DELIVERY WITH INFORMING ME...ON THIS SERVICE AMAZON IS EXCELLENTfirst time writing this review because of this issue...As of now its working great..

"
"

  I'm rating 5star because Amazon won't show 1 star reviewsThis phone has serious heating issues even when its in Idle state. Camera quality is very bad don't be attracted for 48 megapixels it's not worth it. The images are grainy and not good quality. In short DON'T BUY THIS PHONE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. AS AMAZON WILL NOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT THEY WILL PROVIDE REPLACEMENT WHICH IS BASICALLY USELESS BECAUSE YOU'LL GET ANOTHER UNIT OF SAME DEVICE WHICH WILL HACE THE SAME PROBLEMS.

"
"

  Some times screen is blinking and a white colour type of horizontal line appears on the bottom or top of the screen while using the device. And heating problem persist while using for some time. This type of problems will not pesists in any other models of xiomi. All others features and functions of this phone is good but for the appearance of one problem makes a model bad which makes customers discouraging and disappointing before buying this model of redmi. So i feel that solve this problem as soon as possible because it is a newly launched model of redmi. So, be smart and be safe.

"
"

  best performance ,camera is awsome ,Gaming is good fast charging and very smooth with dot display

"
"

  It was an awesome experience with #Mi. They have provided all kinds of premium features in this phone. It is a full value of money in this price range. I have fallen in love with this phone. #Mi

"
"

  It is a good quality phone but , I want to share u some points u should know while purchasing it.1) it is made of plastic , so easily gets scratches.2) it has gorilla glass protection in front glass only.3) processor and display and battery good but it take huge time for charging .4)camera quality is very good but at some times not so good.5) over priced , should be around 10,000rsBecause they had not provide any protection back and the charger given doesn't charge speedly even my old motorola charging is faster.Conclution - u can go for it if ur budget is around 12k

"
"

  My family and friends circle we are using redmi from Note . Camera clarity is unaccepted from redmi. 48 MP Rear camera looks like 13 MP camera. For 12k they can give a better quality. Redmi note 4 is better than this. Redmi will loose the market if they offer this kind of quality less products.

"
"

  Its bix showing ""MADE IN CHINA'Its support 18W charging, so what the point to provide 22.5W charger in the box??

"
"

  Observation after 1 month- Good camera and display- battery backup is satisfying- average gaming performance- Charger Stopped working

"
"

  I like : good display & decent camera , good battery , speakersDont like : processor is not handling the multiple apps, lags frequently , no notification light, sometimes automatically restarting d phone, charging speed is not upto d mark..Overall if ur a normal user go for it..otherwise dont...

"
"

  Phone is Good,I purchased this on 12 sep 2020, currently I am facing battery charging problem..It's required 7 hours to complete 100% charge.So I decided to return it...

"
"

  Redmi Note Series is one of the series which we have to trust blindly, but these time Redmi has failed to impress the Redmi note users..Camera Rear Quality is good, but front camera is not upto the mark. (Selfie lover will be disappoint)Battery Life is only one day if you can use heavy 4-5 hrs continuosly it will go down very fast. It is mention fast charging but it will take time min 3 hrs to charge for 20% to 100% , i am very upset about these.i feel slightly heating problem also when i use continuosly 1-2 hrs only for phone set up (not a playing game).Overlall look is good & stylish, touch is smooth,all functions are working smoothly.If you want fast charging & Good camera go for Realme 7..Thanks & Enjoy ..Stay Safe. Be Safe

"
"

  I am reviewing this product after just 1 day of usage as it's a pleasure to share this. One of the best mid range smartphones available in the market. This product is cent percent worth for money. Looks are stunning and attractive. Battery power is massive. Camera quality is good. Selfie camera is ok. Screen quality is superb and many more exciting features available at this price range.I am totally satisfied with this product. Go for it. A superb product by redmi. Nice packaging and delivery. Thank you amazon. Finally, good luck for redmi and I expect more successful products from them.

  I buyed this phone for personal use and i am very happy with this divice .its bettry performance is Awsm.and the and it process is wow.pubg run smoothly in this divice .if your buged is low than i prefer you to buy this divice.it overall performance is just awsm.

"
"

  Average product from Redmi. There is obvious reduction in quality due lower cost.1. Finger print reader is not on par with competitors (of same price range).2. Proximity sensor is of poor quality. There is also a known issue with the pocket mode. This is a major issue for people who take calls without headphones.3. Camera quality / software is average.4. Battery is probably the best feature of this phone. And of course, the phone is fast enough for normal usage (non gamong) with its 4gb.

  Very Good device, best birthday budget device, I really like the device the camera quality is awesome, song quality is also good , performance is best#Milove#Note 9

  First thing is its price under 12000Battery life(5040 maH) is goodProcessor mediaTek helio G85 is betterCamera(back) is best but front camera is not that much goodScreen Quality is good with IPS dot display with 16.58 cm (6.53 inch ) screen having full screen display alsoIt contains 2 nano 4g supported slots with sd card slot in one trayIt also comes with 22.5 watt charger of yype c fast chargingand capable of 9 watt reverse chargingIt weights nearly 200 grams with thickness of 8.95 mm and 161.48 mm heigt and 76.7 mm widthIt comes with Android 10 and MIUI 11 we can update it to MIUI 12It has fingerprint, face,pin,pattern and password unlock securityIn box there is soft case also but it is better to buy another oneIt comes with gorilla glass 5 which is strong but we have to buy tempered glass which gives more protection.

  I am writing this after using the mobile for 13 days and here I am going to mention 1 major flaw that this mobile does not support volte if you buy a new sim and insert it but if u will insert an old sim which is already volte enabled than this mobile will show volte symbol but if u will buy a new sim and call the sim operator to enable volte on that particular sim his reply will be "" this device does not support volte"" as when we insert the sim the sim automatically reads that which mobile is this but when I asked the operator he told me that on their  computer it is showing that this device is"" xiaomi M2 pro ""a 3 yrs old model may be 4 and this issue can not be resolved . I also complaint this at Amazon and thank fully they refunded me my money.SO WHAT'S THE ACTUAL PROBLEMI think that when we check the imei info of the mobile it is somehow by default written as xiaomi m2 pro and that device didn't support volte so when they turned volte on it showed that this device doesn't support volte.So now it's your decision.

"
"

  I am writing this review after 22 daysFirst of all the battery lifeIt takes about 2 hrs to fully charge itWhen u charge for üíØ percent of battery it easily long for min of 1 day on high usageI used to attend online class for continuously for 7 hrs starting from 9 am morning to 4pm eveningIn between i use whatsapp and Instagram often and also used to play PUBG  for 1 hr in between break in evening after 4 i used to listen to music the @ 8 pm the battery will be nearly 15 percent..So battery life good .Next camera  quality of it is goodNext fro playing pubgIt works flawlessly in HD  graphics when went above i have very slight lagOtherwise it's goodDisplay quality is very goodAlso when continuously playing pubg i have abslight heating issue which is common in redmi phoneBut nonthat extentConclusion : worth for money in this money segment .

"
"

  Pretty much impressed by the camera clarity. But not impressed about fast charging, it took 150 minutes to get to 100% from 10%.Overall performance is good. You can undoubtfully purchase this mobile if you are looking for a budget of 12000. This phone's look was awesome.

"
"

  The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G which is surprisingly powerful for this segment. You also get a 5020mAh battery and suppport for 18W fast charging. The Redmi Note 9 Pro is powerful and everyday work will go smoothly. The display is large and crisp, making games and movies look good.üëç But the sound quality is less.I got that issue in my phone.For the price, the 8MP ultra-wide-angle camera also does a decent job. We were quite impressed with the camera performance of the 5MP macro camera results that are super detail-oriented.

"
"

  Nice mobile. But Hotspot doesn't work. Battery backup is good. Display is better.

"
"

  Minus 2 for mishandling the newly launched phone, Amazon Delivered my phone before time , after i opened the bag i found damaged box, there was a mishandling while shipping, i was affraid to open the box, seal gum seems repacked, finger print arround both the seal, i proceded to return from app, then got call from Amazon, executive told me the seal is fine and open the box, i open the box while she was online with me, she also assured me that i have 8 days to return, use it and if found anything wrong, we will take back....inside  Phone was ok, but packaging was not so impressive, lets hope for best, phone is awsome, Arctic white looks so rich in hand, girls go for it... Surprise to see that phone is MADE IN CHINA. i thought it is coming from Indian factory.

  Great phone for this priceMy rating according to the product and its valueStorage 4/5Camera 5/5Money 5/5Battery 5/5Performance 4/5 as it is a new processor there are some problemsDispaly 5/5

"
"

  this mobile is a small price amount and high performance.

"
"

  The battery lasts a while. But i had a unit replaced and both pieces had horrible charging times 5+ hours for 1-100%. Darshita Etel has bad quality control. I wish they gave enough attention to selling quality pieces as they did to buying out stock during flash sale for re-selling.The display is quite awful.The camera is poor in comparison to 8th gen RedmiThe screen has a cheap look.The battery issue is a no-go.Overall this phone seems very pointless in comparison to Poco M2PROReeling people in with the extra storage and selling them a cheap chipset and empty batty seems to be the marketing play here.

"

  ¬†Aotu contact Fire stick to YouTube.good display & good look.battary is perfect for long time use.camera is medium quality.But under 15k ok.All useful short cut added.Mobile coming with front & back side protecting guard.

  Hi friends, this is hemanth from Andhra Pradesh, REDMI note 9(4gb+128) is good and I like all REDMI Note series bcoz I like to use different costom Roms and root so its perfect for REDMI notes so I have purchased it, all good butWho loves PUBG plz don't go to this variant its hangs much and lags much I think bcoz of 4gb ram, go for 6gb ram,Before this I had using Asus zenfone max pro m1(6+64) its super 3years no lag and hang in PUBG its very smooth.

"
"

  Previously I use REDMI note 4. I purchased Redmi Note 9 on 6th Aug 20, as of now mobile far better than note 4 and screen touch and performance is really good and it very smooth. Camera quality and Battery backup is very good. I recommend to buy this product without any doubt.My only concern is mobile is slightly heavy than note 4.

"
"

  Redmi Note 9 is a line of Android-based smartphones as part of the Redmi Note series by Redmi, a sub-brand of Xiaomi Inc., first of all, I was amazed by 5020mAh Fast-Charging Battery & 22.5W Fast Charger in-Box which was a need as  I hat charging my phone frequently, and secondly, the camera 48MP Quad Camera Array, With Ultra-wide and Macro Lenses was a great touch......

"
"

  Okay here goes my honest review I just got this phone today and as expected these phone is looking good .. Back is kinda plastic... LolIF YOURE LOOKING FOR A budget PHONE YOU CAN BUY THIS BUT DONT EXPECT A GOOD CAMERA CAUSE CAMERA IS NOT AS EXPECTEDTHOUGH THE PROCESSOR IS LIT AND AMAZING(Customers who bought this please give a reply about the unboxing ... Cause i've got this with a temper glass kinda fixed ... )Check for the mobiles defects or damages if any place your replace immediatelyIn over all  YOU CAN BUY IT FOR PARENTS AND CAUSUAL USE peoples ..I do prefer real me than redmi (cause I didn't get real me this time also) ‚åõSo rock on you can buy this with trust

"
"

  No return policy. Its fraud. You cannot return phones even if you received defective piece from amazon.I bought this phone today and  found issue of blur videos and voice not clear and when i went for return. They didnt give you an option to return. Instead Amazon will send technical person to look into it after 2 days means you cannot buy another phone and have to manage with this yourself. So please while buying any electronic item like phone. Must read Amazon return policy. Earlier it was not like that. Bad expereince. Shall inform to consumer court also for this amazon fraud. Please please don't buy phones or electronic item from amazon

"
"

  You can call this phone flagship level phone best camera and nice phone performance with big monster battery I use this phone whole day but not tired using this phone best phone in this best price if you are looking for mid range phone you can buy this phone I am fully satisfied with this phone.

"
"

  This is Redmi's worst phone..15 days I used this phone but after 15 days,My phone's back camera is full of dust now..üòîüòîüòî..I think I have wasted my money by buying this phone ..It takes two and a half hours to fully charge ..When you charge it full, you can use it continuously for about 15hours .üëç ...When i checked its camera the camera is good but not soüòî good..overall Its look is awesome..‚ô•...But important  thing is notification  light is missing ..üòî

"
"

  Even it holds the feature fast charging, nearly 1 hour 40min + of time needed to get the battery full. Which is really a issue.Camera 48mp is just for numbers.Display is good.Battery life is good.Body around the mobile is delicate.Finger print is fast.Sound is baddest of bad.. worst... leastNot easy to handle with 1 finger.Useless apps of MI  preinstalled in mobile..we r unable to delete them.Heating problem

"
"

  Mobile is good in price range, camera is excellent but MI remote is not working and the problem is really frustrating. Is there any solution please guide. Not able to operate my voltas AC with Mi remote.

"
"

  The phone is all good.Camera quality is good enough.Battery life is don't so better but good.Charging speed is good.Performance is nice at this price range 12,000.But this phone is disappointed me because of some reasons -1. On it's back Made in China is written.2. It contains third party applications like zilli, ossum rummy, Dream 11, Moj and Public that you can see in photos.3. Xiaomi Clean masterBut phone is value is money.

"
"

  Worthy for 12k, camera resolution is low, don't expect too much camera quality compared to oneplus, best buy for normal usage.Satisfied: Buid quality, display quality, battery stands up to 2days, speed, no heating issue.Dissatisfied: camera quality and resolution especially front camera, Mi shouldn't pre install unwanted Mi apps.

"
"

  It wrost mobile of Redmi ...main problem about its Wifi ...it's disconnect at sleep mode. I updated the software but nothing result ... also the Hotspot,Cast screen & other WiFi related devices disconnect on sleep mode. Very bad experience ... they gives very short period of return so could not find about its problem within stipulated time & not to return..

"
"

  Spending this  much money not worth i feel for normal user..Wifi and hotspot gets frequently disconnected ,Disconnect of data and voice (VoLte ) if you you get any call  during internet is connected over hotspot or wifi, Hot spot  @ 5 Hz does not show up not sure why it is given. if it does not support. or any future planper day with normal usage kids playing game and on you tube, at least  2+ time need to charge and gets over heated .if we are out door for  funtime, it may not support may be carry a power bank of 5000 mh.48 MG camera is good but does not have zoom more then 10xdoesn't impress me

"
"

  I have ordered this phone on 23rd September  and got it replaced with new one on 25th September coz the handset received earlier was faulty. Again the replaced handset received is still FAULTY it gets reset and reboot itself.Everything downloaded gets flushed out the phone and the screen reaches to its intiAL setup as in the photo attached.It started happening after a week which leaves me no option to return it.I was really excited for this new phone but seems i wasted all my money and excitement.!!!!!!!!!! DONT BUY IT !!!!!!!!!

  Thanks Amazon for being accurate with your products and promises. We did get the phone on flash sale and thought the product could be a little bad and it turned out that I was wrong. You guys have given a product more than my expectations and with a reduced price of almost 4k. Truly worth it!

"
"

  Good phone to use. But made in china as clearly mentioned in the label on phone. But you can buy it cuz in this price no other Indian or other country's phone is available in market. Picture quality is quite impressive. Good battery life, no lage, no heat problem.

"
"

  Redmi Note 9 - Good Value for Money phone under low budget rate of 15k.Cam - 48mp cam is good. You can also install google camera for inner lighting and real camera effects.Glossy and vibrant colours are utmost attractive.4_gb Ram segment is low but 128gb internal is still the benchmark in this rate #note9Overall rating - 4.3/5

  3rd day reviewCall voice is not goodVidieo is not clarityVery strange mobile manufacturing  is not XIAMOI, it is SubcontractorWait for some time and check the performance15th day reviewBattery charging is not good,me mobile battery might be duplicateScreen is hanging

"
"

  Strongly recommend this phone if your budget is around 12000.Battery life and display are excellent.For normal usage it perform upto 1.5 to 2 days.From 20% to 100%,it takes time to charge 2 hrs.Camera quality is quite good as it is a samsung sensor.But if u compare this with sony imx 586 then obviously u will be disappointed.The processor given in the phone performs up to the mark.Loudspeaker quality is excellent.Atlast I want to say that overall experience is excellent.Don't compare this phone with a phone priced at 14000 and above.Good luck üòé

  Recommended to buy but selfie camera is not too good

"
"

  It was a good budget mobile for normal use.. but gaming experience was not smooth for a heavy gamer.. However, except gaming everything was good.. üôÇ

"
"

  This phone is a full powerhouse of features. No company can compete this. #Mi. I loved it. I also recommend it to my friends relatives. The camera quality is just Awesome. #Mi

"
"

  Post 10days usage, I must say: Battery lasts over 2days with a single charge(I being a moderate user), though it seemed to drain faster in the first 1/2days.Camera quality & phone-look is pretty decent; speakers are also good enough.However the Touch-screen could be improved by being a bit more sensitive, especially around the corners of the screen.Smooth performance overall. Truly a budget-phone!!!üëç

"
"

  Recieved today microphone not working in calls

"
"

  I will say overall it is a good product. But i camera should be more better according to this price. And the processor is slightly slow than normal phones in this price range. You can surely go for this if you are taking for home use not for playing game and all because it is not at all a gaming phone it has heating issues you phone starts lagging. So for normal use only

"
"

  Highly recommend guys plz do not buy this phone it take 5sec to take a 1 shot in camera and 3hours 20min for charging 0 to 100% the service of amazon is very good no complain wid amazon but the issue with this phone am really fed up some time it get hang also and 1 more thing they are delivering made in china product as government rule MI phone are manufacturing in india but don't know why they are delivering made in china product and there is app name cleaner which we can't remove and the phone which is manufactured in india there is no such app ...plz think before buying

"
"

  Good phone... Clarity, speed, sound, Battery, Features really good. Look wise really attractive... But camera quality specially video is not up to the mark. Still Camera is not that bad but not 48 MP for sure. Video in slow motion mode is not stable. Always screen slightly blinks.Overall under 12000 it's a good choice.

"
"

  Totally amazing at this price.dont hesitate even I hesitated when I saw the reviews.camera quality is good and natural no over saturation selfie also good if u adjust some camera setting given in it then it's awesome.camera quality is nice the only drawback in camera is the pictures are not that much in low light....and I think I won't take much pics in low light so the camera is good for me...battery life is best ....it charges quickly and draining is not that much..overall a worth one to buy...if ur a beginner go for it...

  After a day usage, writing my review. For the money we spent, it‚Äôs worth. Performance is good but sometimes I feel stuck. Battery stays for a day with normal usage and internet on. Camera quality is not up to my expectations and I don‚Äôt really feel 48 MP. Also while playing videos I don‚Äôt really feel good clarity though. But we can‚Äôt expect more for the price paid is what I feel. Overall u get fully loaded for the paisa u pay.

"

  First of all its brilliant style...Camera very fantastic and looking...Battery backup is marathon....When in hand it looks perfect...Processing is very smoothness....Brilliant display....

"

  Overall this phone Redmi Note 9 performance is good by this time I have been using one month ,fingerprint reader is very good .but I did not found camera quality as per the company says about 48 mpix. Also I found front camera does not have good sensor as in Zoom or webnar other app it does not auto adjest britness and more than one hr webnar heating problem is found but till now no hanging speed is good. Charging is very fast. As due to COVID work from home  aspect Mi need to take note

"
"

  When first received, I thought wrong device has been received as it is not in gray color but a blue gradient. Then checked online for pebble gray pictures and confirmed the same.The phone is overall good with specs at this price range.Camera quality is also good.Touch sensor also works up-to the mark.Battery back-up is good. In normal usage, it lasted for 2 days and then also 20-30 percent battery will be remaining. When phone usage is low, it has also lasted for 3 days which is quite good.Charging time: Average.

"
"

  Bad phone camera not good.Battery not good.. Big problem is colour of display is very dull...even there's no return or replace policy..so don't buy this phone... Amazon is misguiding it's showing Made in India but this is Made in China ..This is not tolerable.... Don't purchase ..This deal don't have refund or replacement policy...

"
"

  It is a best smart mobile forever at veey low budgetFaster charger than other MobileI was usde to mi smart phones in last 5 yearsFor uses very best things to another mobileIt gives finger prints lock with face lock which is very quick to unlock your mobile phone#MI best market phones# love mi phone

"
"

  Display quality is pretty average.  Brightness is too low for watching movies and TV series. Color saturation are not that great either. What is point of full hd display if company can't provide good brightness. I have used other mobile phones and they have much better display quality. Battery is good though.Camera is average. Don't expect much from it. Be careful before purchasing it as there is no return option available.

"
"

  I am fan of mi products but suggest to go through these before buying. transparent pouch which is not suitable for camera protection.chance of very quickly scratch on camera.worest camera only 12mp instead of 48 mp.(exact after 20 days i got these issues-U tube voice is toooo low,while seeing youtube no sound increase or decrease. Once mobile screen suddenly switch off even switching on also not open for 3 min.most important one is while calling phone is hanging for 5 to 15 sec.

"
"

  All r good and nice super battery,nice camera

"
"

  For 12000 Phone is ok...butCamera quality is very bad.....Battery life is averageTotally unwanted apps...Everytime we need to clear memory or cleaner to useWhen we use cleaner some trash and apps will be closed....

"
"

  Great mobile with great camera and screen quality. We do not use it for gaming but the functionalities like calling, youtube & WhatsApp are being used heavily. all functiosn work seamlessly awesome. Battery life and camera are the stand out feature of this phone. We have been using it for a month now.

"
"

  1) I was only looking on to made in India(i know its only asseblyliing in india even though ) and in the review part i have seen all the reviews with attached photo of it having made in India tag. But the one i received with"" made in China "" tag.2) now the phone is facing with audio issues. Even when we put in loudspeaker we can't hear anything.Pathentic!!!!

"
"

  Really awesome phone at this price. Blindly go for it.battery is really great & in coming updates it will support 22 watt fast charging support. Camera is above average. Overall great purchase at this price.

"
"

  ¬†Worst service from Amazon i get a faulty product whenever  i open utube and any other service it automatically restart and i try to contact the amazon technician he told me to send pics on WhatsApp then no response  when i try to contact  him again no response either then i call Amazon service they told me thats our technician mentioned in report  that your issue is resolved  like this kind of product and services  is i m getting  after paying 12 k great

"
"

  Everything is good in this phone. This phone is meant for normal games not for heavy games like pubg but u can still play it with little lag. This phone is good for multimedia usage like streaming youtube, movies, Social media etc. The soft case provided with phone is not in good quality. Flash light doesnt works properly while wearing cover on the phone.

"
"

  The Redmi Note 9 is available at a starting price of Rs 11,999 and offers exceptional battery life and decent overall performance. The camera also takes good pictures in favourable lighting. Despite being a budget phone, the design where the phone scores the highest. That polycarbonate unibody design minus any creeks look good in the hands. Those looking to buy a Redmi Note should invest in the base variant of Redmi Note 9 that offers all the features, except that it comes with 4GB of RAM.

"
"

  It is a wonderful product, delivered on time.... Only pain in mind it is a MADE IN CHINA product... When we are all towards banning the Chinese manufactured products.  Since it was a gift for somebody's birthday didn't want to return... It was mentioned in the Promo below the product on Amazon that it is a MADE IN INDIA product..

"
"

  This is good phone at this range and have some pros and consPros1) Good UI2) Screen display is good3) very fast charging4) Selfi camera is good5) face unlock is very fast and good.6) back cover comes and goodCons1) few apps are preloadded and unnecessary but we can remove them. you will get 50 GB out of 64 GB2) Battery life is average3) Camera quality is average not expected to 48 MP.

"
"

  Best Phone in This segment.....Great And crisp display.....excellent battery backup...loud sound...big games easily playeable at high settings....a must go for this range...found no issues..

  Ok let's talk about the review of this redmi note 9#mi here is the another big blockbuster from the redmi and it is the awesome phone in budget with all the good specifications battery and display quality is too good.Talking about the gaming performance.I can rate 3.5/5.

"
"

  1.Good battery life2.Good processor Media tek helio g85 good for gaming purpose3.Camara quality is awesome4.But one thing iam didn't no there is no fm but in the redmi note 9 phone fm facility is there iam really didn't no5.fast fingerprint sensor6.But there are so many India banned apps are there like mi store ,mi credit etc...7.fast charging is 2 to 2and of hours fully charged8.Selife is vera level9.over all my review is 9/10

"
"

  Note 9 is a great phone in this budget and I'm pretty much pleased with the performance of the phone. Even when I play high-graphics games, there are no issues like tearing or stuttering in the phone. I would recommend everyone to purchase this phone. #mi

"
"

  To be honest, I didn't like the camera at all.. the phone does give a good battery life and comes along with a fast charger, The gaming performance is great , but honestly Camera section is disappointing, it does offer 48mp,and bla bla bla, but end of the day it is a samsung sensor coupled with Helio processing, if the camera performance optimization is not done in the coming upgrades, the Camera of this phone would probably the worst hit ever.

"
"

  As always this offering is also a good altogether package from Redmi.Writing this review after 15 days of use.It lakes only in camera department for me.I am not saying that this camera not worthy.its just okaish.main drawback for me is its form factor.its is a big and chunky phone.

"
"

  The battery, display, performance and camera everything is absolutely amazing as per the prizeüéâ I love the phone because it's super smooth and I'm enjoying clicking pictures with it's different modes. If you're looking for a phone under 13k this is the best choice otherwise go for the pro version.

"
"

  No water spill repeellent. Dust and water drops easily enter camera and within one week microphone and selfie cam damaged and service center asked for paying 6000 for replacing... very bad built quality

"
"

  The best thing in this phone is battery lifeLooks and feels decent with a plastic but good body design, will feel a bit big and hefty.Display is good and after MIUI12 update it looks even better.Nice for gaming too.The only con is the camera, it is not as good as of those in same price range in Realme.

"
"

  #MiAll Redmi series phones are very good .But this Redmi note 9 is really superb.The camera and battery performance is unbeatable.At this price , no other brand offers this specs.I liked the phone so much

"
"

  Redmi Note 9 is better than Note 8 in terms of camera battery & display sizeBut Helio processor is quite negative than Qualcomm Snapdragon processorFor ultra gaming better opt for SnapdragonVideo making also better in SnapdragonOverall Ratings 7.5/10 :) worthy of money

"
"

  1)Camera quality is not good...My old device redmi 7 pro has best quality  compare to redmi note 92) low performance compare to redmi note 7 pro3)in paper redmi note 9 specification is. Good but practically they r so bad... Because of optimization..

"
"

  Fabulous phone with great features and a good price. Camera quality is good, Battery life is awesome & Gaming is also nice. RECEIVED MIUI 12 UPDATE ON THE SAME DAY OF DELIVERY. So very happy with these features and phone. Good to Go...!!!!Thank you Redmi for this product.

"
"

  After reading & viewing lot of user reviews & videos had opted for this Mobile. Fingerprint sensors works really good with multiple options. Battery life is easily the best in market today for a smartphone this size - happy at least don‚Äôt have to charge on a daily basis.  Camera Quality is simply superb.

"
"

  This phone is faulty,laggy and I feel cheated after buying this phone.I asked for an exchange and the technician kept me hanging for 2 days and then asked me to schedule a technician visit.This is the first time I am using the replacement feature and it felt like amazon is partial with its Indian customers .@amazon: Why is your world class customer centric service not applicable in 3rd world countries?

"
"

  Very Nice Phone with beautiful full display. I have bought 2 sets with different colours, pebble grey & arctic white. Although, it is not grey from anywhere, else it has bluish colour and arctic white is moreover shaded blue rather than having more white. Still, both the colours looks great. Happy with the battery life. The back cover inside the box is also of good quality.  It's worth buying money.

"
"

  Browsing experience not good as compare to other Xiaomi mobiles , hanging issues in some apps ( Snapdragon is better as compare to mediatech).,notification led options not available,Back panel is polycarbonate material .Cost of product is more as compare to some features.

"
"

  I like this product.all things are good but I'm not happy with it's front camera & charging speed because in the box we get 22.5 Watt charger but it support only 18 watt charging speed &it front camera also not take prefect shoot in night. I request to redmi please improve it charging speed & camera &it requires many major update . Then I required this phone others wise if any one buy then Wast your money .so redmi please improve it

"
"

  Phone battery capacity was good but the screen performance is not good .. and also primary camera clarity was not good to take selfies .... And take pictures .....

"
"

  Love my redmi note 9. Farbolus design style specially back camera. Thanks amazon for timely deliver. Front camera could have place in middle never the less best phone under the price as I purchased 4gb 128 gb under 13.5k.

"
"

  Mobile performance is very pothatic all the applications will hangs up after We use it for 20-30min. As per company claims the mobile charging time is 2:30 but its taking about 4 hrs to charge. Most disgusting thing is few apps like facebook google meet will not contact to internet sometimes even after performing basic troubleshooting like clear cache and clear data uninstall and reinstall .

"
"

  After usage of 20 days writing this review..Phone is hanging a lotCamera quality is not at the markNetwork issues - Phone not connects quickly and requires to restart.Overall money waste product and do not recommend to buy this

"
"

  This is a beast device delivered b amazon and Redmi#Excellent performance in terms of processor and battery#Amazing camera#Worth Money every single penny#For gamers this is the best phone in this price range.Thank you so much amazon and redmi for this device

"
"

  ¬†Very good phone . It's full of battery life . Screen quality is good go for it . Price ja really accurate for this much feature phone

"
"

  I want my money back, first week ok, but then started hanging, not good performance, phone hang many times, slow processing speed,camera is also not upto mark, better to buy Snapdragon processor mobile

"
"

  Good specifications.. with Honest prices...

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile its a waste of your money.Camera is very very poor, Don't showing natural colour. My Opps F3 13 Megapixel camera is better than thisSound is also very low than other mobiles.Not a fast charging mobile it takes longer tome to chargeIts a 10 days replacement policy by Amazon but when i tried to return they didn't returning my phone. Now i am stuck with this fake and worst mobile

"
"

  Made in china mobile is sent. But in product description it is mentioned ""made in India""  Felt cheated by Amazon and seller

"
"

  Nice phone for such a price. It's good value for money. It's features are also nice.It even arrived 2 days early for me.The only thing I find some improvement is that the battery draining is fast that you expect nothing more disadvantages.Overall it's a good phone for such a price.

"
"

  There are lots of issuesI m writing this after using this phone for abt 15 days1) started heating up during games and hang too2) camera protection is not good... One of my lenses getting dust from inside and causing decrease in pic quality3) battery life is good... Thumbs up for that4) finger print reader and face lock is also not working well

"
"

"
"

  Petty nice design & good BATTERY life . And have some weight , 48 mp camera is average &selfie camera is ok ok. After lockdown ( with 18% GST) yes it is worthy.  Processor is also nice .

"
"

  The brand is always getting better and better in coming time people really get a amazing phone in this price range with good quality battery life the phone performance is grade it works really smooth without any problem would highly recommend if you want a good phone in this range.

"
"

  Used just few hour, first impression: Made in china not in india as per pasted sticker on back pannel. Will update after some time.Working very well BUT BUT BUT both Amazon and mi are cheating with us, As mobile is not made in indiaüò™ü•µ.Recently MIUI updated mostly unwanted pre installed app removed, 4GB rom and 2GB ram got free.

"
"

  Decent product, not high expectations... Camera is just ok sound quality is just okIf anyone want to buy a phone for gaming never recommended.....for photographer never recommended.... If you want just general use like calling, playing songs then you buy it otherwise DOESN'T RECOMMENDED.......

"
"

  At this price, it's awesome. I don't play games, so usually I charge my phone after 2 days that even having more than 40% battery left. So battery longevity is great. Though quad AI camera is not upto that mark but it's good.

"
"

  Awesome Product Well Its A nice In Mid range Please Go with this Phone if You have A budget Under 15kIt takes around 3 Hours To get Fully Charged This Is biggest Concern of this smartphone It should Support Fast charging and Pretty Nice Performance in terms Of Gaming And Other High End works

"
"

  I received and its chnies product and battery got drained very past and also its not fast charging ..its taking 4 hrs to full the battery .  its chinees product pls donot buy from this dealer

"
"

  Phone looks good with some decent configuration for the amount, I would not recommend if you are primarily choosing it for photos or videos because quality is not as expected it'll look like a painting if you zoom and so much of pixel breakage.No matter what ever pixel they say camera is not good

"
"

  Fast delivery by amazon‚ô°Good performance under this price segment(g85)Long lasting battery (>5000mah)Full hd+ displaySleek and stylish lookSound quality is okayCamera is not upto mark but okay for meOverall I like it

"
"

  48 MP AI quad camera is just for namesake. always capture blurr image . compared to 7pro and 7pro was far better than this. design and all are gud working is fine . made  in china . many apps that are not supposed to be there  but they are.

"
"

  In a week this phone given to service center 3 times.. Actualy there is no display after connecting a call so we cant cut the call or cant do any other activity or cant see the display in screen..They are rectifying the issue and giving back. But the same issue continues.. The return time already over so we need to replace the mobile with new one.The product is not goodPls help us

"
"

  Totally awesome phone.Gives a solid sturdy feel in hand.Does not feel like a budget phone at all,Has features of a high end phone.Bang for buck,You cannot get Such phone at such price point.Will definitely recommend to friend and family.Love #Mi #Redmi

"
"

  phone build quality is very poor. Totally made of cheap plastic.Video quality very poor. Phone seems to be of short life ......I used to hate Xiaomi, redmi or mi, but after believing one of my friend i bought that and now my hate is there forever for these poor brands..Dear Redmi, Please take it back and return my money.Please do not buy. If you want get it from me..

"
"

  Gifted to my sister,Delivery was too fast, packing was nice.Note 9 is good for those who uses phone less, not recommended for gamers and heavy users. And also not recommended for the selfie lovers.But I am happy bcoz my sister is happy, she is not a selfie lover or a gamer, this is the reson she likes Note 9 much.Thanks Redmi.

"
"

  Back looks beautiful, frame plastic looks very low quality (I have Realme 3 Pro, it has plastic frame which looks beautiful)Camera optimisation is not good (my brother's K20 Pro and even my Realme 3 pro both are better optimised)Can be called a Dual Camera phone (Ultra Wide and Normal, other 2 units are bad)Gcam mods not working, should have given Snapdragon 660/665

"
"

  Hi all, redmi note 9 is a best phone in this range, its camera quality, design, processor and looks, all are good, but I got a problem in phones sensor, but amazon replaced it but again replaced items also have same problem, now amazon is going to refund me, is there anyone who have same sensor problem (while calling proximity sensor creating problem, anytime light of phone got on and off)

"
"

  Awesome phone in the segment appreciate the price and on time delivery

"
"

  Redmi note 9 is the best budget phone of this year. 11 out of 10. Excellent features, too good camera. And lot lot more. I recommed this budget phone for budget phone buyer's.

"
"

  Not upto expectation...battery life is ok ...it said fast charging but charging takes a lot of time...camera is average,macro is waste ..slight heating also observed..lot of preinstalled unnecessary apps which cannot be uninstalled or disabled..

"
"

  Typical xaomi phone. It comes with miui 12 update.

"
"

  Charging is  not fast as said in phone specification.

"
"

  A very good phone. We can say value for money but I felt that there is lag while zooming in and out .....it hangs while doing so, secondly some colours are missing, I tried to capture sun set , but it turned out  to be all pink insted of the sun set orange colour, third, there is no zoom option available in front camera, otherwise it is a good phone.

"
"

  Product is nice but invoice is crushed in packet so I can't rcv proper invoice & in that package is not giving any contact no  for asking copy of invoice

"
"

  The phoen is Made in China. Many apps like cleaner, getApps are present. There is no turbocharger as it says 60% charging takes >75min. Back Camera is good but front camera looks like VGA. Battery performance is less than average. Just a economical phone not value for money.

"
"

  Overall phone is very good ....Battery easily u can use one day when full charged ....Camera is good...This time redmi win hearts ....but just want to improve the back plastic body of the phone...Sound goodLooks decent and sexy redmi note 9 ...100% value for moneyToo quick delivery as well... Thumbs up to amazon and redmiüëçüëç

"
"

  Battery life - 1 time charge per dayDisplay - 4.5 starCamera - 4 star( rear) ,3.5( front)Finger print sensor works fastGaming experience in this budget - 4 starOver all, at this budget, its a killer, fo mid range users sure should go. U can rely and good for long term use

"
"

  Today I have received white color Redmi note 9 4gb 64gb version. When I ooen the box, first I noticed that it is not labled as Made in India .. it is completely Chinese product... Even charger also have label as made in china. Second thing I noticed a big scratch start from camera to bottom... How can I believe it is a new product.... Totally disappointed with it.

"
"

  Very nice product...got it delivered in  under 20 hours... scarlet red colour is just awesome..compared to note 8..it should have been a glass back...but the provided quality is also very good.. consumer who has not used glass back would definitely find it awesome..camera and other things are good..got miui 12 update just after setting up the phone

"
"

  It take more time for charge battery more than 2 hours. In gaming, it is a wonderful gaming phone Helio G85.Disadvantage : camera both have not good 48 MP camera is also average camera not good or not bad. Front camera 13 MP is low if your photo is nearest to you then good but if you in more distance landscapes of behind your face then good capture

"
"

  Please don't buy this phone..taking 3hour to complete charge..and hanging in multi task..poor camera quality..it's better to buy Samsung 13 mega pixel mobile..And no return possible with poor performance..try to buy mobile in off line in a local shop.Very bad experience in Amazon

"
"

  there is some major issue wd this phone its been just 3 days its hanging 3-4 times in a day, bought it fr my wife & mother too & both facing same issue......its a 64 GB ram but worst than Redmi NOTE-5, which has 32 GB ram, its clear its processor has some major issue...... older versions r betterRedmi ll regret its launch as not worth at all.....

"
"

  Great phone value for moneyGreat camera at this priceGreat batteryOverall 10 out of 10Xiaome put screen protecter is attached to display don't buy knewDon't buy knew for this phone

"
"

  Good phone with some great features.Amazing battery life.Camera quality is average.Alexa is not there though.Good purchase in this price range.

"
"

  this product has is just amazing. with lots of features . camera quality is just awesome with 48 mp back cam and 13mp front cam. this phone is really gaming master. it carries many apps. and the very important thing is this product has a very reasonable price. i recommend the hesitating purchaser u can buy it without hesitating. this made my online studies even more good

"
"

  They mentioned Mobile is Made in India in product details but they are delivering Made in China mobiles. I lost trust on Amazon and Xiaomi (Redmi).Please verify whether it is Made in India only once you receive the Product or else just return it back.Very disappointing thing.Amazon and Xiaomi are misleading the People.

"
"

  Phone is good. Have gifted to my parents and they are very happy!!

"
"

  It's a very good smartphone for the price range that I purchased it for cant say it's a bad phone because it has a processor for high end usage so cheers good one

"
"

  Awesome phone but I would like to say that there is a problem with #MIUI 12 as it has many bugs but Xiaomi has informed that they will bring an update soon so if anyone is buying this phone do not upgrad to miui 12 because it is a beta version so I suggest everyone to use MIUI11 And download when all the bugs are fixed .

"
"

  I am not sure if it is supplier fault or its manufacturing fault. As mentioned in specifications, camera is worst on this device. They mention 48MB but its not even 12MB. I have been with Readmi series for last many years but it seems not its time to switch to other brand. Note9 was a big disappointment.RegardsManav9137025791

"
"

  Worst mobile ""Made In China"" Mark Camera quality is like 10 yrs old technology, hidden aaps for data transfer to China, dont but.

"
"

  Good mobile this price rs10800 segment ...In case no discount....... I suggest extra pay and purchase redmi note 9 pro or POCO m2 pro

"
"

  Nowadays The major problem is, the MI/Redmi phone Amazon delivering all those phone's tag is  Made in chaina, there is no Made in India.This is the recent days problem.Whether you buying a phone from MI store there everything is made in INDIA.Why this type of major problem???

"
"

  Good ph overall in this price. Camera is not upto the.mark for painting photos it adds bright effect and will change the originality of picture.

"
"

  After 3 days of use I found it a best fone in budget with all the required specs.Gaming experience it very good.No heating while playingBest camera experience .see attached picsQuick charging is very goodLong lasting battery life.Complete... satisfaction

"
"

  Not worthy. I exchanged my real mi u1 for this note 9. But disappointed.Display quality very badCamera is not as 48mpMy recommendation ,go for other device in this price range.

"
"

  It's ok as per the cost.. screen rotate troubles a lot.

"
"

  Smartphone is really very goodEverything is excellent.Very smooth and fast user experience.Loud and clear speakers and earpiece.Battery drains fast but  its fast charger charges the phone quickly.The display is immersive.But have some software issue in my device it's showing Chinese language in most of the folders like downloads and file manager.

"
"

  Overall the phone is very good, it is a great multitasker, but due to the processor i guess pubg mobile lags a lot it is not smooth, the graphics were great but not the gameplay and in my experience the is not able to cope up with battle royale games like pubg mobile, brawl stars. It has a great camera the battery life is very good and with a fast charger.

"
"

"
"

  Bought redmi note 9 on Oct 2. Phone got switched off on its own on Oct 9 and not charging and rebooting too. When contacted Amazon , they are saying it crossed the return window period. People in Mi service center are also not too helpful in this issue because phone was purchased through amazon app. I suggest not to buy electronic items through amazon.

"
"

  This product performance is much worst compared to REDMI Note7S.  This was ordered assuming improvements from REDMI Note7s. Too Much of heating issue with an hour online class. Getting heated even for mobile charging. Much disappointed with REDMI Note 9

"
"

  Awesome battery life ....easy to catch in hand.... amazing display... performance is amazing...front camera is dull in low light but in good light the camera clicks amazing images...rear camera is marvelous...All the sensors are fast...movie watching experience is great...everyone loved the phone in my house

  For daily Normal use, it's best mobile with all necessary features and good camera.But the negative things which i felt was,1. Auto brightness was not working accurately.2. It's not 22.5W charging support, it's only capable of 18W only.3. Getting frame drops while playing heavy games.

"
"

  As you can see cleary Redmi note 9 have a weird display issue.When the device is exposed to light Dark mode is turning to greyish and the contrast is decreasing.I requested Replacement from Amazon but they keep rejecting I explained everything to them.I am totally unsatisfied with this product.POOR DISPLAYPOOR SERVICE FROM AMAZON

"
"

  Very nice.Pros:Fhd, battery,camera,screenCons:Bit slower for games (initial lag) but okay for common usage. Worth it if you have strict budget otherwise go for poco or 9pro for gaming

"
"

  Front camera problem  and back side stiker is made in China we order made in  India but we get a made in China is that problem

"
"

  i like redmi note 9 but charger taking too much time to charge the phone and battery also draining fast . after charging the phone i use the mobile maybe one and half day. and charger taking 2-3 hours to charge it. camera is average . look wise phone is good . overall good good product

"
"

  Not feeling fluent performance but it's good... Not problematic... Miui 12 update is good... Overall ratings with camera performance... 3.8 out of 5 star... If device price is under 12k... 4.5 out of 5 for 4gb/128gb.

"
"

  I bought the phone for higher battery capacity . I don't use much of camera or social media but despite that battery is kind of disappointed me. and managing for one day per full charge.

"
"

  Excellent phone

"
"

  1.Very very good product under 12k2.Battery long lasts and charging is also fast3.nice looks and big display4.front camera is not as expected do not look like 13 mp .

  Heating problem

  This one Heating from the start. Hangs on using. Seemss to be used before.

"
"

  All specifications are goodCamera is goodBetteri is excellentBut over all this company is a fraud to IndiaThey show that thay are made in india but they deliver a made in china product

  #MiThis phone blows my mind with its specs at this price point. One thing I can tell you that you will never been dissapointed after buying this feature rich phone.Great camera , performance and design.Purchased 2 phones for my family membera

"
"

  Well, at this price range this smartphone is a good choice. It has 5020 mAh battery which gives you 1 and half day battery back up on Normal use. Also it has MediaTek Helio G85 chipest which is quite good for gaming like Pubg, Call Of Duty and Fortnight etc. But at high graphis (while gaming)frame drops  and stutter lag is noticeable.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor to me seems pretty good.Battery life is awesome.Overall view its actually a decent phone.But,Camera quality is actually very disappointing like for real ""third class"" 48mp camera captures worst then 16mp cameras compared with other devices and 13mp front camera don't even deserve half a star.

"
"

  Fantastic phone. Battery life too good. Nice camera quality. Build quality is also very strong. Loved it.... And fast delivery by amazon. Thanks.....üòä

"
"

  Not a Good Phone at all. Battery taking 6/7 hours to charge fully. And draining very fast. The look of this phone fooled me. Not at all recommended. Definitely returning this waste material.

"
"

  The phone is a good choice in this range It comes with huge battery life. The rear camera works good in dark also but in front there some issue comes of frame drops from the front camera which may be solved in the system update.Although  it is an good performance phone and value for money.

"
"

  Disappointed to see, Made in China.There are better options at this price.We cannot return the product, so think 10 times before purchasing.Charger is 22.5w but mobile supports 18w only.

"
"

  Medium varient

"
"

  2 times I returned. Heating issues, battery issues, camera quality not good. Better to go Samsung m31. Instead of this mobile

"
"

  Budget Phone.Only One Good Thing Is Reverse Charging.Mi Company Not Removed Some Chinese Apps, These are pre installed.Rear Camera Is Bad. It is not like 48MP, FakeFront Camera is Best.Instead of this SAMSUNG M21 is The Best.

"
"

  VERY AMAZING PRODUCT  LONG BATTERY LIFE BEST PHONES FOR ONLINE CLASSES AND AND FOR ONLINE STUDY  REDMI PHONES ARE BEST IN THE WORLD. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT LONG SCREEN HAS ITS OWN AMAZING FEELING üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ BEST PRODUCT OF 4GB RAM  AND 64 GB STORAGE UNDER RS 10,000

"
"

  Nice phone under 12k, worth it.

"
"

  The phone is overall very good.Pros: Battery Life, overall processing good, Good display, Very good in hand feelCons: Cameras average, Display Brightness is low, Average Speaker

"
"

  A smartphone with 48MP and with 5000 mAh battery capacity in this price range is highly recommended for those who looks for smartphone like this.... Go for it ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è

"
"

  Most important is the cell phone must be ""MADE IN INDIA"".  But Redmi provides ""MADE IN CHINA"".I bought this phone because the Redmi official website describes this phone a Made in India product, but in reality, it is Made in China. So it really disappointing about Amazon's/Redmi's monopoly to sell us Chinese product.

"
"

  Overall good phone but sometimes it get hanged while using camera and some multitasking.The build quality is good but it is too weighs. You need to reduce it's weight in it's successor.

"
"

  Nice phone smooth use but camera quality is little bit poor front cam is ok not much good ok ok mobile under12k

"
"

  Camera quality is not good . In day light it's quite good but in dim light or night it's quality is very poor like it's camera is 8MP instead of 48MP.Other features are good except camera.

"
"

  Finger print sensor is convenient at back , I don't find it so at the side. Otherwise phone is excellent piece of technology

"
"

  It's too early to review but first impression was great. My mom liked it very much. Thanks Amazon for keeping 2 day delivery promise. Will review in detail after usage for some days.. I must say that I had a Gr8 exchange deal.

"
"

  The camera quality is of worst.. please don't go for this model. The video recording is always get blurry and the objects are people not properly visible in full day time lighting as well.

"
"

  It is a nice phone.battery performance is nice....but display touch is a little poor.....I loved the look of phone ...but while using snapchat and changing the filters the screen does not changes fully ...I mean there are places where the phone can't edit....properly....although there is a little problem in display

"
"

  Made in China""üò°Really Disappointed.""Made In China"" product!No ""Made in India by Redmi"" ? (the reason, I selected Redmi. but disappointed)Giving '1star' because,no '0star' option is there!!!![1. Giving 1star to 'made in china'.2. Not reviewing for 'Quality & all

"
"

  Camara is  just ok.Charging is not like that mentioned by xiomi.Battery life is good.Design is quite good.Display is normal.You can't play games for long time you have to face heating issue and lag.So for normal use it is quite good you can ho for it but not for gaming.

"
"

  Original bill was not found.

"
"

  Honest review: First impression is really nice. This phone is really good with really good camera, battery and obviously looks.The Pebble Grey color looks really good. The screen size it awesome. Don't know about gaming because won't be using it for gaming. I think this phone would be an awesome buy under 12k.

"
"

  Where ever I red Redmi Note 9's review it was mentioned that it has a fast charging which is fake commitment done by company. I did not experienced any fast charging in this. Either I have been given a false charger/cable. This cable is not even fitting properly in Charger.I want you to check my problem.

"
"

  Good phone in 12k price range... however the camera quality is not satisfactory at all...the photos are not very impressive...sply photos taken in night is very very dull..else everything is fine..

"
"

  Battery life is so good and camera is good but mobile price is some costly compare to mi others device, and the facility of sending any app to memory card has not been provided in this mobile.

"
"

  If u r looking for a best budget phone then just close ur eyes and buy it....This phone is awesome for gaming purposes..... the picture quality and processing speed is just amazing wich makes gaming smoother.... the battery life is stunning..... no more words to say... üòçüòçüòçüòä

  Hello every buddy i buy this phone but this phone not supported fast charging i m attached a image i have other mi fast charging device and charger i try with other but same no fast chargingIf any buddy device support mail me (dhil2on gmail com) @ and . add in space

"
"

  I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS PHONE BECAUSE I HAVE PURCHASE SPECIALLY  FOR PLAYING PUBG BUT IT IS LAGGING TO MUCH

"
"

  It would have been great if Redmi Note 9 had a better processor.  Like Snapdragon 710 would have given.Battery performance, Fingerprint scanner, fast charging, face unlock, fingerprint scanner, camera performance are goodBut processor is very low.

"
"

  I will never use Amazon. They wrote 7 day replacement on product and while visiting the my order section, its 20 days return or replace. It created confusion and hence i am unable to return my product. I want to return the mobile phone because it's camera performance is very poor under low light situation.

"
"

  Large battery with quick change üî• large screen and screen quality also well.  Go for this if your budget under 12 k .

"

  Average phone ....

  I like this phone

  Wrost mobileHanging problemIf u play offline game then its also heat too muchhBattrry charging worst its give a fake chargerFrom 0 to 100% it take to charge 2.30 hours

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile. Within 1 month my phone had hardware issue and I had to visit service center to fix this. Later came to know this is very common problem of Redmi mobiles.Learnt from this mistake and will never buy Redmi mobiles.

"
"

  The Redmi Note 9  phone I got was Made in China. Although, Redmi advertises that their phones are assembled in India.Of course I take responsibility for it- I know that Xiaomi is a Chinese company. However there could have been some satisfaction that at least it was assembled in India, but no.

"
"

  Nice device..Great performance, no lagging issue, camera quality is good but not perfect it may be more better, no heating issue, smooth performance.Very fast delivery, it delivered one day earlier.Overall review is good phone in this price range üëçüèªthumbs up for that.

"
"

  I got this note9 phone. The sensors are not working. This time redmi is giving the worst phone and after the check done by amozon online the test report was failed still amazo is not replacing the phone istead they just arranged a servise person visit so guys dont buy this redmi note9.

"
"

  12k budget phone offering a 48mp camera, that's just insane.If you are looking for a budget phone along with premium looks, then go for it. You won't regret.The 48mp camera is just awesome. You'll love this phone better than other 12k smartphones in the market.#note9

"
"

  Awesome mobile in this price segmentCamera quality is goodBattery life is fineAttractive 6.53 inch long displayVideo quality is good full hdOverall good quality product...Happy with the product

  Made in China Faltu phone it is as like china it make problem in less than 10 days I advise to indian people dont buy if your money is come from real hard work.Also I said to amezan that it say that this phone are made in India But it sales Made in China phone on the name of Made in India.

"
"

  It was been months actually who does not want to buy this product at this time when you're looking for a new one.i charge my  phone for a 1 hr for a day

"
"

  Everyone knows about the pros but the cons I found are-1. Camera quality is not upto the markMegafixes are just for fake. Front camera is not good.2. Ads are present that's a big bad thing.3. Bloatware are present are you can't uninstall them that's too bad.

"
"

  Good phone for parents who has limited usage.Camera is good for this price range.battery backup is awesome!Full HD display  wonderful!overall a good phone slightly more than entrylevel. but definitely not a mid-range.

"
"

  Phone is simply crap! Speaker sound is bakwas and 48mp camera is not even close 2mp of old samsung smartphones.Too much bigger in size.Heavy weightedBack and front easily get fingerprints and tough to clean back pannel

"
"

  After 15 days use I am writing this, over all phone was nice,display quality,camera, battery was good. Phone was little bit bigger not able to fit in the pocket, there was a issue in screen lock, there was a sensor problem phone was automatically unlocking without finger print & security lock.

"
"

  I ordered this phone recently during the flash sale. However I received a made in China phone!!Sad to see Xiaomi bragging about this product as made in India while the truth is they are supplying Chinese phones.Moreover the seller description does not reveal the country of origin.

"
"

  Awesome MEDIATEK HELIO PROCESSOR, macro lens, wide lens, top, powerful battery, in screen camera, 401ppi in MEDIATEK HELIO, etc it's too many features with the best price. Love you to the core for your quality and affordable price MI.

  #milove*Wow awesome phone*Just buy and very happy buying this phone*Really pretty good this phone*Thanku #mi And #Amazon

"
"

  Phone is very good in this segment .It is good looking phone.Camera,display and battery performance are the main features of this phone .In the starting it take average 1-1.5 minute for one percent charging but above 90% charging it takes average 5-8 minute for each percent charge.

"
"

  Redmi not 9 is good device on this price and it's a lot of features on inthis price. It's coming with a four camera setup and front camera is a mini punch hole camera on top right side on the display. Redmi not 9 is powered by MediaTek Helio G85 processor and it's a large battery 5020mAh

"
"

  The display quality is very good then the battery backup is just above average screen time is only for 7 hours. Their is no lag and heating issues. Overall at this price range it is better than realme narzo 20. The camera quality is fantastic in this price range

"
"

  This mobile is very good in look, having all important features within a budget.It is a very worthy purchase at a reasonable cost.

"
"

  All is ok but manufactured by china,this is not good,why amozan selling china products in india,legally not valid,stop dump the china products,really not good?

"
"

  This phone is over all good. But charging is not fast. It takes 5 hours to charge 100%. Battery life is ok.Sound of this phone not good. Camera is over all ok.

"
"

  Awesome built quality provided in #Note 9, the camera quality is too good in both rear and front camera, The performance of #Note 9 like a beast ..over all too good at this price range

  Best mobile phone üì± under 12k4gb ram and 64gb romIt comes with Mt g85 processorThe gaming performance is excellent for all high end gamesSuperrrr

"
"

  Worst Redmi experience. I am using MI & Redmi Phones since 2016. But Redmi Note 9 sudden degradation in all aspects be it camera processing, display features,slow battery charge over, in all aspects it has put me down investing an amount of 13499. Never buy Redmi Note 9.

"
"

  Camera was surprisingly good at the price range. Selfies were clear as expected from a Xiaomi device. Also very light considering the 5000 mAh battery inside! The Arctic White is a very soothing color though it rarely looks like a white.

"
"

  Received faulty product and even worst customer service from amazon. Told amazom service support person . They are telling we will not do anything you have to contact company service center .

"
"

  I hated the product . I used to like mi before yhis but when i bouhgt the phone it came with so kuch bloat ware that i couldn't even uninstall the phone didn't give me a good vibe so don't recommend it to u.

"
"

  Good phone at this price overall performance is good for day to day use, camera is definitely not perform as 48mp if i have to rate it between 1 to 10, i will give 7 out of 10

"
"

  After 10 days using this phone,Battery life is too good, according to chipset G85 performance is good, ram management is good, Screen FHD+ is good, But Camera quality slightly less 48 mp primary sensor but it should be improve through update ,  overall it's good phone to buy

"
"

  Best product in this price.. Just go for it without any hestation.Camera is so goodBattery life is so goodGood for gaming

"
"

  Display is very poor, worst ever. I have compared to all other Redmi phones and found that it was the bad display phone. Very dull even in full brightness. I am very disappointed with the phone. üò≠

"
"

  I bought this phone for my uncle(Mama). He is enjoying it.Battery, call connectivity, sound, voice, everything just perfect. Nice phone, looks great.Its a plastic body though but what else you want in 13.5k 4GB and 128. :)Good One!! I liked it.

"
"

  I buyed this phone because my budget is low there for i buyed it.and i am a big fan of pubg.i didn't get any leg or something in it till now.and its battery performance is also good.and its degine very good.its camer is awsm. in his price range.

"
"

  Note 9 is the best in its price category.Love MI for supplying a transparent silicon back cover in the box and scratch guard was pre applied on the screen.

"
"

  Fastest Delivery by Amazon, packing also very good, Just go blindly for mobile it's Awesome, worth for prize. Just get today only

"
"

  Very good handset... Battery life is too good. No charge required for 2 days. Design and shape is user friendly.On the downside, Selfie camera is not upto the mark, Fast charging not good.Overall a good product and value for money.

"
"

  Awesome phone at this budget with nice specsBattery life - 8/10Camera quality (both)- 9/10Gaming experience - 8/10Fast charging - 10/10No heating issuesRecommended for those looking at this budget

"
"

  Good decent product , charging slow , mare than 1 hour gaming slightly heating. Super display and camera.üëèüôåü§ò‚ö°Don't buy above 12k4gb ram, 64gb it is good.

"
"

  Worst Product, It gets heated after some mins of usage, battery drainage issue is there. Worst Customer Service from Amazon, they dont give any confirmation mail, msg or document for pickup orders for replacement or refund. One has to wait 15-20 days without any information.

"
"

  Made in China product delivered to me instead of made in india.This is really not expected. Advertising as it is made in india but sending china product.This is one kind of fraudulent. This happened 2 time.camera quality is very poor so I want to return the phone

"
"

  Majorly camera is a disappoing in this mobile. We can not take videos with 48 mp camera. Also 48 mp camera is not as expected it's just a little better than 12 mp camera.

"
"

  Battery life isn't good.Battery full charging time 5 hours with 22.5w charger.

"
"

  Fully satisfaction

"
"

  Phone is overall good,  in design,  bettery life, camera.  everything is good yet,  no issue display also bright.

"
"

  As brightness and display is not off the mark and camera is decent and the price is  quite high as per specifications.

"
"

  Amazon budget phone with Excellent featureI am using it from last 2 days faced no issue till ,full value for money ,go for it in this budget it us the best phone#mi

  I like this product !!üëç perfect phone ! ü§≥ camara quality is super ! Slow motion option should be improved . there were little lag while using multiple apps at the same time ! Value for money ! Good battery life compire with others ! Screen quality is very gud

"
"

  This is best phone under the range of 15k with 48mp camera.Containing g85 processor gives it a smooth experience. And 6.5inch screen gives a feeling of premium phone in hand.I just loved this phone. Using it around a week. Just loved it#note9

"
"

  Actually battery drain fast and phone is good no heating issue camera also good fast charging2.5 hours to take full charge display avg overall good phone but battery back up is issue

"
"

  . Wide screen , camera qualityüî• , it feels premium in hand . But sorry to say that, after miui 12 update it's hanging to much and battery consumption increases.Afterall G85 processor not so good for gaming .For daily use it's quit decent .

"
"

  It is hanging. When I call or use others.blue line comes in screen. Bad product in 13500..amazon return order is not submitting.. Amazon care dont receiving my call..

"
"

  Launch day purchase for my daughter. So far, good. No issues faced.  Little costly.

"
"

  Worth the money. Fast charging, Battery life, no hanging issues. Camer is disappointing not 48MP.

"
"

  I feel personally after comparison with redmi note 7 camera quality is much better compare to note 9.Overall I m not impressed with the performance of note 9.

"
"

  Good in built quality ,. Camera is very good in day light but in night it goes very bad. Selfie camera is very bad in both day and night ,it produce warm pics just like red it make me sad. Performance is quiet good. Xiaomi has to improve camera just like note 7 pro.

"
"

  In this price range this phone has been better performance...camera review 10/8üëçBattery , performance, design 10/9üëçI think this segment compatition phone realme narzo 10Both of similar performance in all spects..

"
"

  Good product. Used Redmi note 3 before and very much satisfied with Note 9. Recommend one

"
"

  This phone is a great value for money whether talking about its display, battery, design (plastic unibody but with this price range it's oküòú), processor but the camera lack here in this phone but with some updates it may get up to the marküëç

"
"

  Best phone in this budget. Just received it today and already in love with it. The video and sound quality are the beat. Keep it up Redmi. I recommend everyone to buy this phone who re looking for 6gb and 128gb variants. This one is the best.

"
"

  Mob is worth for value camera first its like a blur on display and second I change settings and now its like a pro thanks for the worthy product Amazon

"
"

  I will go directly to pros and cons Pros Battery Rear camera Helio processor is good Cons Bulky and thickFront camera Display Overall it's a nice phone in this range. redmi ads makes irritate. Amazon description video helps than description page about product spec.

"
"

  I faced few problems with 4+128 variant ""TWICE"" But the 6+128 is no different, when we record a video , the audio and video are not in sync!!!

"
"

  Camera quality is not good as much expected.Battery charging is good , I charged from 20% to 100% required 2hrs to charge.Battery life 19hrs normal use.I will update review again after some days.

"
"

  Camera quality very bad,display good,battery life good,heating issue noticed during charging.Overall not worth compared to price

"
"

  I having issues back fingers print it sounding on tik tik  as like lose some parts in this phone

"
"

  All the mobile is good but heating issue and camera doesnt work fine and also not good. Must improve camera quality.

"
"

  Battery is good-but takes a long time to charge (may be because of bigger capacity), Display is good, Camera is Average - Not as good as old redmi phones, Finger print is pretty fast & responsive, Performance is good for the price range .

"
"

  Beautiful color. Value for money. Fab camera! 2 sim card slots and memory Card slot which is awesome.

"
"

  I loved the mi smartphone.In this smartphone of value is very best nd it's our budget smartphoneFor gaming to use very superbly touch in mi smartphoneNd has a very big display nd smooth touchThickness will be very slim to the smartphone

"
"

  the mobile is not working at all, the mobile battery drain very soon, possibly I may have received a faulty product looking to replace it but there is no option and also Amazon Get support option not working at all.

"
"

  Mobile build quality goodYou love Battery performanceGaming awesomeOnly one draw back is camera quality,camera is behaving 48MP as 13MP and 13MP as 5MP.Please redmi improve camera quality in update.

"
"

  #mi the phone quality is very good it has a long lasting battery life the price is low and #mi has made a perfect phone at a perfect range this phone has all the features which one is looking for and that too at a very low price the phone is very smooth in functioning

  Battery is very excellent and fast charging and camera is very good this phone is better than redmi note 9 pro i recommend to all you buy this phone

"
"

  Camera Quality is very impressiveBattery Charging time is high approx. 2 hrs+ which is a bit saddening.The most magnificent thing about it is it's Processor performance 100/100.Better buy 4-64GB Varient than 4-128

"
"

  Budget phone.

"
"

  Comapared to realme narzo 10 this is the best with glass body, FHD resolution and good cameras but ‚Çπ1000 higher for Helio G85 they could have sell for ‚Çπ11499 or ‚Çπ11999

"
"

  Good buy..Looks good..Slightly heavy..Maybe I will get used to it. Thanks

"

  Awesome phoneI have some fear of heating issues. But its really good and worth of moneyGaming are more than I expected.I bought for my brother he is enjoying it and also got the product 3 days before,Mediatek processor nailed it

"
"

  Brilliant phone in this budget segment with all advanced specifications. Good camera the design is marvellous although the camera bump is a minor problem but it's not that relevant. Moreover a great battery life lasts a full day.

"
"

  this phone comes with amazing feature at this price no other phone can compare with is beast awesome battery design everything is so good miui is lovely #note9

"
"

  Battery life is quite good. Rear camera is ultimate but i am not satisfied with front camera. But still good product at this range. And pebble grey is best out of other available colors and also back cover was looks good which was given in box itself.

"

  Really good product by redmi.......Green flag to this redmi 9 all series.........But this phone is not as sturdy as note 9 pro

"

  Worst product. Do not buy it...

"

  I'm writing this review after 7 days of usage. This phone is superb. Camera quality is best in this range. Display is beyond my expectation. Overall performance is mindblowing.Don't think too much, just go for it. üëå

  Showing made in india in description but it'sactually  made in China product

"
"

  Redmi note 9 is excellent mobile at this price nowadays. Amazon is trustworthy to purchase mobiles.

"
"

  Back Camera is not working properly and poor quality feel like it was 2 MP instead 48 MP. Asked for return/replacement but they say no return and for replacement they will send a refurbished phone not a new one.

"
"

  First of all, it has a big battery which last more than one day. Battery charging also fast. Good processor which can run Many of games. Display also crispy clear. Perfect device who has fix less budget. #Mi

"
"

  Does not support videos more than 480P. You will not be able to view 1080p videos on you tube, netflix and other oTT platforms.

"
"

  This device is perfect for this price range.Fingerprint sensor works fast.Camera quality is good.Battery is the plus point. It can last longer than 1n half days for me.I am very happy with this mobile.#Mi doing nice work.

"
"

  Its too much hanging and i am not able to replace it too.i got an defective phone,i want a replacement and is not showing any replacement also.

"
"

  Display quality is not so good or as expected. As we have seen FHD+ IPS disply thats for written only I haven't experience that quality, my rating for screen 4/10. Otherwise camera quality is much more better, battery perfoance is also good.

"
"

  1)nice 48 mp camera with 8x zoom2)battery backup is also nice it last 2-3 days after being continuous use3)processor is also good to play games like pubg4)works so smooth feel like mhakn#mi

"
"

  Good phone but battery very bad camara is. Also ok not good others brand camera build quality avarage packing was very good

"

  The 3.5 mm headphones jack not working.Poor quality

"
"

  Very bad experience with phone, bought it for my mother,after 3 unsuccessful try of booking, the delivered product is faulty, network issue from very 1st day,very bad experience to return the product

"
"

  Yesterday I got this mobile, since then I am facing a lot of problem like fast battery drain, facing heating issue while doing nothing, it occurs even when while watching youtube after this it suddenly stops everything to cool it.

"
"

  I found my item is damaged by water. I want to replace it.

"
"

  This is best phone under 12000 rupees. It has powerful g85 processor which make it ultra fastGreat work by #mi love this phone

"
"

  #MiLoveEasy to useBest in gamingI will recommend to everyone to use thisBest camera

"
"

  Phone is very good in terms of camera , battery and performance. BUT ONLY PROBLEM IS TOO MUCH BLOATWARE  and almost each app wants to ask permission of camera , phone, files etc. When it is not even required.

"
"

  Don't buy this phoneBecause it is having a serious camera dust problem.It will be having deposit of dust slowly and the main camera will get blurred.Please don't take it lightly and please don't buy.

"
"

  Its 4th Redmi phone i am using, which is not upto the mark. Specially screen touch, not exactly hanged but kind of...

"
"

  Value for money but instead of note 9 you can go for note 9 pro or note 9 pro max

"
"

  It is all good but when i start charging the it heats but all over it is a best value for money camera is very decent but front cam is not up to tge mark but still goodAnd there were some chinese appsWell done xiomi

"
"

  Best product at reasonable price,Happy with its camera clarity battery life, but one thing if you're buying white one it's not real white colour it's sky blue colour faint blue colour but it's look better than plane white

"
"

  Product is fine but unwanted advertises pop up on main screen need to remove which irritate .

"
"

  #MiAnother Excellent phone by the india's no. 1 smartphone brandThis phone is like the beast at this price segment ,i.e, 12000.Performance and camera is great

"
"

  The phone is pretty good according to the price. Bt their are some loopholes. Color composition is not so good, front camera is not so good. Fingerprint sensor is pretty fast. U can play pubg without lag nd heating for hours.

"
"

  If frame is metal build,Then okay.Xioami pls unlock 22.5 watt fast charging support. Now i get only 18 watt charging support.

"
"

  Good Battery BackupPerformance is goodBut Camera Quality is EXTREMELY POOR, Color optimization, light adjustment, AI Defection all needed to be fixed by software update.Go for Note 9 Pro Or any other device.

"
"

  Nice product in this budget

"
"

  Camera quality is not upto the mark .. very bad as per mentions 48MP

"
"

  The product was good, but the printed bill did not have the vital details that would be needed incase if I have to claim warranty. Those details have gone outside the paper.  I don't find any option to ask for a new one now

"
"

  Good product but need optimisation as after miui 12 update camera is not upto the mark otherwise battery backup is superb its quite good for multimedia consumption because of its fhd+ display Hope Xiaomi will optimised ASAP

"
"

  Battery camera good but after it everything wrost internet is very slow then my old exchanged phone vivo hang issue in normal games like coc very disappointed with this phone

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile i'm facing network issue and battery issue , it's worst product, and there is no way to return this product so please don't buy this ,realme 7 is better than this mobile.

  I really love this phone at this price, i got this with card discount, Mobile performance is really great with good quality of camera, Display Quality is also good, This mobile is perfect for me.

"
"

  Look wise its damn beautiful.Battery backup is also great.I think camera should be more better. Its doesn't gives that much of clarity what we expected.

"
"

  ProsLooks niceCamera good.. night mode also okConsNot upto the mark of battery backup since it is 5000mah as mentionedHang rarely during gamingPlastic body

"
"

  Very much dissappointed. Volume for incoming calls is too low. Even on speaker it is quiet low. Touch screen response is also slowNever buy this phone. Worst product from Redmi

  Good phoneCamera quality is bestbattery life goodBudget phone üòÄüëç

"
"

  Mobile is good...But delivery boy has bothered me a lot...he use to wrong way of talking...

"
"

  Everything is good but when it comes to perfect picture clarity I refer realme than Redmi... Cz when the both brands had same pixel capacity and realme pictures are more realistic and beautiful...

"

  This is not made in India

"
"

  best Product in this price range....best budget smartphone in this price......thank you so much redmi for this wonderful surprise.... value for money product and best Product

  The phone quality is excellent the only problem is little bit slow for the battery to full while charging. The price and the quality of the product give full satisfaction for me.

"
"

  This mobile is best in battery performance as well as in display quality, for gaming this one is best.At last this is value for my go for it blindly

"
"

  Volume and power button looks and feels like cheap plastic. Everything else is good.

"
"

  Honestly I am happy with the product..but I am disappointed because there was no screen guard on my phone when I opened the seal.. and there was fingerprints on the glass.. this is not expected..

"
"

  Changing time Too slow like 10W normal changer but redmi told have 18W support and given changer also in box but not like what there was told . Changing time is 2:40 Minutes really Disappointment

"
"

"
"

  I expect phone to be Made in India but it turn out to be Made in China which is quiet sad for a customer who trust Redmi.Really saddened for what I expect and what I got from the company.

"
"

  Very nice product #note9 . Camera quality  proccesser for gaming purpose is very nice and reliable  and we'll shaped phone. Definately I will buy more for my family as well. Sound system is unbeatable.

"
"

  I brought Redmi note 9 Made In India product but Amazon sent Made In China Product....I am not happy.  This is really worthless to buy costly product to waste money.. very bad Amazon service...

"
"

  The phone is nice but the phone got me is made in china and  I don't get any update to uninstall cleaner

"
"

  Amazon send me made in China product but in product specification it is shown as Made in India product..

"

"
"

  No doubt Redmi gives best specs. I wish the Operating system had no Bloatware and ads.

"
"

  It looks stunning for 12k. Its  really worth.But little ads are pushing and then camera portrays an extra brightness. Otherwise it has a smooth experience.

"
"

  Very good phone at this price#mi loveBest gaming processor and quality of camera is also very gud. Best budget phone at this price range

"
"

  Nice phone but video quality is not so as good pictures are breaking in youtube , camera is good, pictures are nice but while taking video pictures are breaking

"
"

  Note 9 is really good under 12k budget. I got it for 10800‚Çπ in prime day sale. And feels lucky to have it. MI has done a great job by giving 22W fast charger in box. I really loved it

"
"

  Unable to do multitasking on phone if i switch to another application current application gets close not even 2 apps cannot run on same time even cannot listen music in the background

  I ordered Redmi note 9 grey colour, but it was delivered in blue color. Anyways the blue color is also good so i kept it.

"
"

  Awesome phoneValue for money, good battery backup, screen quality is also good.#note9

"
"

  I have got this product by 'Made in china!!!!!.But the same product i have ordered through by Flip kart and it is made in india.

"
"

  Just a all rounder ... Not 48 megapixel camera ... Pubg running very smooth .Fine Battery.selfi camera also poor performance

"
"

  Camera quality is not up to that much. And fast charging is also fake because it's take so much time in charging.

"
"

  Calling screen is awesome.  Very good quality product. I am very much happy with this product.

"
"

  I love everything about the phone except the fact that it lags and it starts to heat up 15 min after i use

"
"

  Internet speed slow compare Samsung mobile same network and same place checking so internet speed problem.

"
"

  The ph camera is good.The problem is with speaker. When one speak over ph, the ph vibrates from the back of the ph. Which is not there when one plays video.

"
"

  Good Product easy to use#MiLoveBest cameraBest batteryLoved it for gaming

"
"

  I have purchased 3 numbers of redmi note 9 for my family members also. This is enough to tell about this phone.Green colour - loved soo much

  #mi the best note series by the no. 1 Brand , excellent battery life, feature loaded phone, with honest pricing . It has a elegant design I want to thanks #mi for such a great phone

"
"

  This pack do not include a head set, which is normally a standard component in mobile phones

"
"

  Battery is very bad as well as the camera quality. Every 2 hrs it needs ro be charged and now they are even not taking their bad products in return. Too bad to buy

"
"

  This phone is like charme. I am using Note 9 from past 5 days. It has very good battery life. MI has done a real work on it as it's box includes 22W fast charger. I love it

"
"

  Very good product at this cost.Camera quality awesome.Battery is draining fast but charging is also fast.Display is very large.Overall it is the best product at this price.

"
"

  This is a good phone for normal use quite satisfied with battery life also but not a good phone for gaming overall nice build quality

"
"

  Very nice Phone in this Price.Battery Life - NiceCamera Quality - Very niceValue for money.But, there one drawback that there is no notification LED.

"
"

  Received made in china variant , i though it was made in india, disappointed.

"
"

  After updating to Miui 12, there is no stuttering in PUBG M and it is running smoothly at constant 38 to 40 frames Per second. Camera is just fabulous at this price range.

"
"

  Poor quality... sim1 network issue, phone is heating easily, camera quality is  very poor compared to my 'note4 (13mp), just look at my images.Redmi started cheating now..

"
"

  ¬†It's a value for money and provide a better performance at this price range. I bought it for my friend and is fully satisfied for him.

"
"

  i buyed 2 of these product looking in flipkart it has about 16k but in amazon its only 13.5k thats the main thing i bought this product thank you amazon

  Its Nice phone. but company has told 48mp camera just for publicity. this phone cameras look like 7-8000 price range phone's cameras.

"
"

  Mobile is great. But whenever I open a link in facebook, a slight flickery happens on screen. Other wise great phone

"

"

  This phone comes with a 5w chargerThey say it's 22w charger

"
"

  I ordered this phone just because it appeared ""made in India"" in Amazon. But the product which I got is ""Made in China"". This is unethical.

"
"

  I dont need to describe this product but all i can say is if you want good features in minimum investment so go with this product.

"
"

  Over all features very good.. But front camera is average.. Battery fully charging taken time approx 2 hours to 2.5 hours

"
"

  Very good

  I love redmi.it is very good device

"
"

  Redmi disappointed me. Mobile has hanging issues, camera quality is not so good. If you are interested in playing games don't buy it

"
"

  Phone is very good in this budget but only problem is that it is charging very slowly.. about 3 to 3.5 hours taking to full charge...

"
"

  I would like to tell that the camera software used by this phone needs to be changed as it not as good as 16 megapixel camera phones.

"
"

  Battery is very weak, worse than previous versions and there is a regular problem with network bandwidth.Overall its a bad buy.

"
"

  This product is really really awesome...lived it so much..battery is good ..display n camera is excellent..

"
"

  Good performance.Battery life is amazing.Fantastic look.Light weight.Overall it's best phone in budget

"
"

  I think this is a complete package in 12k. The specs are unmatchable and I'm really happy with it.

"
"

  Fantastic Mobile

"

  Overall good product.Worth buying in this budget.

  Battery backup is very good, camera quality also good and screen quality very good

"

  At this price its value for money

"
"

  Battery is awesome . Quard camera is too good . Within 11999 it's a perfect mobile phone with camera, battery, overall performance.

  Trying to purchase since first sale and unable to add to cart. Redmi puts very low quantities for sale. Stupid marketing strategy.

  Why you are crazy about a chinese brand?I bet you want get their parts after 4-5 years. I have a very bad experience with Xiomi. They outdate their own phone within 1 month but parts are not available for older phones. That the difference between a cheap brand and a brand like Samsung. All the people here please go for Samsung they have now better phone in budget range. And the best part is their service. Believe me you won‚Äôt regret after 3-4 years if you buy Samsung. Redmi‚Äôs phones are cheap but not best. Go for Samsung. Samsung‚Äôs phones are light in weight, premium build quality,durable,robust,long lasting and their parts easily available. Xiomi,Honor,Oppo,Vivo,Realme if you are buying it consider their life max 4 years. So don‚Äôt waste your money every 3-4 years. I purchased 3 redmi phone in 2018 that is for my father,mother and brother and they all three are dead now. Dead in the sense network IC gone in one phone, second became very slow and hang and heat up so much,3rd one again the network issue. Once again telling you their life is not more than 4 years.

  Ok

  What do you notice on the screenshot shared on Redmi Note 9 series phones, specific to camera.Major issue is that, the dust goes inside easily. Redmi has not done it's QC across 9 series phones that great.Whatever the pros or cons, this itself make anyone to feel a low quality, and a basic technology failure and stop calling make in India.

Hotspot could be connected to Laptop.2.Contact Number couldn't be saved with a space in Google contacts.3.Bengali keyboard is not working with all symbols and alphabet.4. Camera quality is very bad.5.Display is not upto markNow I am just rushing to MI service center. What an phone.  Just two days later I have to rush to service center..Pros1.Colors are very attractive.2.Battery life is satisfactory.Overall very very bad experience from Xiomi

  Why a regular customer can not but this phone with easy method. So much trouble for regular customer. ITS A BIG SCAM.I am an reputed customer of Amazon and if I am not the part of this sale then Amazon is pathetic platform for me. I will tell everyone in my Circle not to but anything from amazone anymore.

"
"

  There was charger or earphones both are available or not . I wonna to purchase this phone so, I wonna to knw that .

"
"

  Are we waiting for weeks just to see a sale that last hardly for a second? Please get good stock before declaring a sale. It doesn't take time for people to get frustrated and buy it from other platforms, I got it from MI store today, when this amazing sale seemed to be 100% claimed in just a matter of one second.

"
"

  Mobile is good . but I feel camera need to be improved .they are saying  48 megapixel camera , but the photo standered need to improve more . sometimes I feel Nokia's 2 MP is almost equal to this 48 MP camera . I personally feel all camera are more or less same .Megapixels are increasing but the quality of pic is not improving . plz look into the quality of the pic . why can't you add a selfie flash and mobile need to be little slick .I'm reviewing after a week use .

"
"

  Gosh the number of third party apps on this phone is mindboggling. Had to sit and delete every single one of them. Most of them are useless apps which are of poor quality and have wayyyy too ads on them. Also, the amount of user data that is collected is INSANE. A normal person with minimal knowledge about such things doesn't know what he's getting into and these companies are leveraging that. Sat for couple hours and opted out of all such data collection schemes.

"
"

  I was waited for an hour after added to wish list... deal ended finally. If user able to add Wish list why are they not allowing to add cart... don't we have other work to watch this stupid ""wish list"" label?

"
"

  Best phone under 12000.  Better than realme nazro 10 and I am not saying bad about  realme nazro 10 it is also good.  It has a best quality camera.  the think that liked in this phone is  that full H.D display. it also have a battery backup of  about 2 days. It is not that much good for gaming but it had a smooth  experience. Its screen quality is also good. It also simple to handle.  Overall a good phone to buy in 12000.

"
"

  My mobile is suddenly getting hang from yesterday's onwards it's a new mobile 1 month back I had purchased. If we turn off power button and turn on power button means again it will work.I had done restart, update, and also any virus is there like that I thought and I installed mcafee antivirus also, but still it was hanging very badly every 3 minutes it was hanging very bad.And also display quality is very bad.

"
"

  A great phone under 13k. Pretty much does everything smoothly.Pros-Good battery Life,Great display, Smooth Gaming experience, no lags in day to day performance.Cons-Front camera can be a bit better.Overall, its a great phone to have. Probably the cheapest and most reliable punchole display phone out there. Other phones mostly have outdated notch designs.Verdict-Best Phone under 13k

"
"

  For this budget- note 9 is fine (bought on prime sale @10.8K)..Battery backup is good with quick charging facility..Camera is very disappointed- photos are not worth like 48MP (Even my galaxy s8 shoots better).

"
"

  I did not buy it from Amazon, but from MI store for 15k... Phone is good, good battery life.. but remember you cannot remove the boltware unless you root your phone, ADB method dose not work...

"
"

  I purchased this on store., it will take more than 5 hr's to full charge,no use of fast charger,also phone range is poor compared to other smart phone over same network operator,camera not up to the mark

"
"

  Please let me know, if any body's phone is perfect in all aspects does he want to purchase a new mobile by exchanging existing phone.  Please don't make false hope on customers by keeping exchange offer.You better remove that  option, this is my sincere advise.

"
"

  Unsatisfied with camera quality. It not even like 13MP

"
"

  Very bad quality phone....Don't Buy...  üëéüëé

"
"

  4gb 64 gb is value for money.Don't go for 4gb 128gb (13500) / 6gb 128gb(15000)Average camara..Good looksVery Good battery backupPoor fast charging.. 20-100% takes 1.5hrsA good gaming phone for pubg and cod

"
"

  Mobile is ok but camera clarity is too bad. front camera is taken too low quality image ,I'm totally disappointed. It's not worth for 14999.Otherwise good.

"
"

  it is a good smartphone in this price.camera,design and built quality is very good.but i like slim and compact smartphones .it has a 5000mah battery so it looks bulky.

"
"

  This phone is awesome it's a battery champ üëç.Is costed me just 5% battery for 2 hrs journey.The phones experience is very smooth and it charges at the speed of light.I will surely recommend you to buy

"
"

  Overall Phone performance is goodBattery backup perfect.Camera quality is great especially the night mode.Processor i think u should go for Snapdragon.THE WORST THING IS I RECIEVED DEFECTIVE CAHRGER. IT TOOK ALMOST 4 HRS FOR CHARGING I'M GONNA REPLACE IT. But I'm disappointed because of this.

"
"

  Bought this beast 3 days before , it's just stunning . If u r looking for budget smartphone just go for this....

"
"

  Plzz dont buy this phone because charging speed is very low. I have used this phone charging speed is 2hr 30m . Really friends , 91mobile testing site have tested time of charging is 2hrs 45 mins

"
"

  I like the touch smoothness and overall design of the phone otherthan a line which i liked most was written on the back of the box ""Made for India""

"
"

  Thus phone has a low quality audio output during live performance  or during recording with a microphone. To rule out earphone issue, back to back trial was done with other phones.I need a replacement of this set.Like - Good Display /CameraDislike - Audio record  quality very bad

"
"

  Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone. Amazing phone.

  Nice work with me and my mobile is switched off namaste namaste have to go out with friends namaste to you

  Standard must be degraded. They have started rolling out Mediatek processors instead of Qualcomm SD. Earlier versions were still good. Also all these phones don't get android security patches often. After 6 months, they will stop supporting upgrades just like my Redmi Note 4.

"
"

  Got this worst performancenot supporting dual app for google paypoor finger print performanceheatingbad screen touch performancewhat not a mobile with N number of issuesand Poor customer service is as wellworst ever experience

"

  Redmi note 9 is all well. But, I can't able to update its system... asked for system Update but, stop updating even 1% ..... üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Many says as it's China Product, so this could not be more updated with its new version ...  Authority please fix my problem...

"
"

  Redmi note 9 have voice quality issues.receiver end not getting enough sound after some seconds of call.receiver getting voice low and some time not getting voice in both sim with different network.kindly suggest if any patch available or settings to solve the problem.

"
"

  Bettery backup is good ..look is awesome..camera is beyond of imagination..worth it in this price and touch is sooo smooth...must buy

"
"

  Been trying from 24th july not able to buy .. what i have do to buy this phone . its really frustrating waiting fr sales waiting but still not able to grab

"
"

  Phone heating issueScreen clearity not upto markBattery issueWaste of moneyHigh weightI recommend not to buy

"
"

  Don't buy the phone for camera or for making YouTube videos, the camera quality is worse, it doesn't support 1080p at 60fps. Night camera is very bad, you can't even see your face in low light. YouTube channel - Siddharth's Vlog

"
"

  First of all what I have absorbed that redmi note 9 which is selling on Amazon is made in China product and in flipkart its selling made in india product u can find out the the reviews in flipkart.

"
"

  Camera quality is too goodBut the display is not much brightAnd processor is quite decent....

"
"

  Misguiding information!!!!!! In the banner it says ""Made in India"". But in reality it is ""Made in China"". It is a blatant attack on trust. This can't be tolerated!! Beware of misguiding information....very disappointing

"
"

  Battery is gooddisplay is also good.and quality is premiumAND HAV A GOOD MOBILE I JUST SAY GD

"
"

  Camera not as expected and sown. Disappointed.also looks bold. Touch also not smooth and slow. Appearance is good.... Not recommended.

"
"

  Worst mobile phone ever at this price range .Overall xiaomi is cheating with indiansAnd indians also happy by this cheatings

"
"

  Good but overpriced...Good but overpriced.....Good but overpriced........Good but overpriced.......Good but overpriced okToo many good option available in this price segment

"
"

  Very bad Chinese crap. Bad camera, wrist ram management & processor performance.Display is just ok. Sounds in earphone (boat, sony & JBL sucks.This is my second mi phone & only hipe left quality gone.

"
"

  If i have to complain anything about redmi note 9 then that will be its price. Rs 11k would be fine for the base varient.Personally i quite liked it. Everything's great about it. Go for it!

"
"

  Poor camera its not 48 mp... Look like 13mpAnd front camera also wrost.... #(Note 8 better phone) compare to note9....Motham pagilinatlu vastundhi front camera chi... My phone returns

"
"

  Its very badIts occupy more storage to install the appsCamera quality is very poor i am totally dissatisfied for purchasing this product dont buy thjsüò†üò†üò†price is ok but the quality of this phone also low

"
"

  REALLY THE VALUE OF MONEYIN MY POINT OF VIEW THE PHONE US FABOLIOUS AND JUST BUY IT FOR YOU

"
"

  even though phone is ok ok, will not go for such Made in China phonesits worth spending 1k extra for other non china phone as the hardware quality and build quality use to be better

"
"

  Except selfie camera all things are perfect

"
"

  Quality of pictures are good. But its AI is totally waste. Poor night camera. Other specs are good.

"
"

  Slightly overpriced...Not a good camera...Good battery backup..Good for gaming.You can get better phones on this range..

"
"

  Overall the phone performance is terrific in this range. And the camera quality is too good and build Quality is not bad .......BUT THERE ARE SOME BUGS WHICH redmi mentioned they will resolve in next Update...

"
"

  At this price we cant expect more.As usual redmi features camera is ok.battery life is good but cant expect the same in future.Perfomance is good

"
"

  No widevine L1 support can't stream videos in High definition... Even some basic mobiles offer this facility ....need to update camera ok performance battery also ok

"
"

  I like the screen size of this phone and looking modern phone with great specs and value for money so I recommend this great phone

"
"

  Don't buy this phone from amazone it'a bad phone with poor performance and they don't allow you to return the phone and cannot get the refund onece you bought it so be ware ...pls stop buying from amazone

"
"

  1} Design - Design is really good looks and feels premium in hand a bit heavy @200gm but got used to within a day üòç2} Screen - Good quality IPS screen and viewing angles are also good. Enjoying online video content on this mobile and the punch hole camera doesn't bother any much , 90hz refresh screen would have been killer in this price ‚òëÔ∏è3} Battery - Amazing battery life with 5020mAh battery with 22.5w fast charging easily lasts full working day with heavy usage üòç4} Dedicated SD card slot - This is really missed by a lot of people because every time when we change phone it becomes handy just to put the SD card with data in new phone without the hassle of transferring all data in to new phone ü§ó5} Dedicated headphone jack - Headphone jack is just really handy I don't know why in recent trend big manufacturers are skipping to put a 3.5mm jack in phones even when they can easily fit it inside of the phone üëèüèº6} Type C charging - I always appreciate if smartphone is having Type c charging alot as most of phone recently have it üëåüèª7} Processor - Very powerful processor to handle daily tasks and performs very well with even 4GB Ram. Gaming experiance is good at medium setting but not the best in pubg üî•8} Call quality - Call quality is also good never the recipient complaint about distortion or noise unless you are in very noisy environmentShould you buy : Yeah definitely , I am really happy with this phone in this price range and I recommend this phone to others ‚úÖüíØ

  My original order didn't have any battery life or maybe dead phone. Have purchased Redmi device earlier which one was value for money, but this particular model(Redmi note 9) was worst part of my purchase till date. I have really lost trust in Redmi and Amazon due to the experience I have gone through since 10/08/2020 till 19/08/2020 (original handset purchase till replacement purchase).

"
"

  I was anxious and uncertain about the features of this device.... but after receiving, i found this a good product from redmi at this price range...This is my 3rd phone from Redmi..features are good  good camera, reasonably good battery backup though the charge doesnt long for more than 36 hrs after full charging.....you have to set the camera to 48 mode to get sharper pics.. night mode is also good.... Only shortcomings I find in this device is  its a bit heavy and mild heating issue....

"
"

  I gifted to my mother, and she's very happy, she likes it as the the design/form factor is very 2020 the in-display front  camera, rear Quad camera, decent battery backup, rear mounted finger print scanner, dual sim slot with separate dedicated memory card slot. Worth a price. üòòüòòü•∞ü•∞üòçüòçü§©ü§©Good work Team Xiaomi üëçüëçüëçüëç

  Redmi Note 9 Is Very Good Smartphone In This Price.I Am Much Satisfied With This Smartphone.I Also Love This Smartphone.After MIUI 12 Update I Got No Hang or Any Bad Experience.I Am Also Satisfied With This Battery Life,Camera Quality Is Also Better.Yes,It's Value For Money Smartphone.Another Thing Which I Like In This Smartphone Is Design,I Like This Smartphone After Plastic Built.You Can Watch Images Which I Share,I Am Sure You Like It.

"
"

  Very poor camera quality even on 48 mp camera, front camera is worst , charging very slo w, it has 15 watt chager, charging time is 2.5 hours , miui is very bad as compared to realme ui, very bad experience, sound is also low

"
"

  Pros: full HD display,long battery life,good looking design,reverse charging, Widevine L1 certified for HD viewing Netflix n amazon primeCons: fast charging isn't 22.5w and no update fixes this issue despite charger supplied being 22.5w capable,camera is average but better than others in this price segment and definitely not for night shooting,cpu lags in almost all taskConclusion: go for pro version of redminote 9 or realme 7 @15k ,at 15k not worthy of price

"
"

  Bad Camera. Picture Quality is bad. Not worth at 12k. It should not be more than 5k. It shows that it is actually how Chinese products are. Amazon should write on website where the product is manufactured. It is the customer right. Now Government should make it compulsary to display on online portal to show place of manufactured and assembled. Overall bad product.

"
"

  There is nothing much to complain about this device that means it is perfect for its price.No lag and apps open and run with optimal speed.Camera is also good and macro is an additional advantageBattery backup is good for an average usage and lasts for 2 days. Type C also complements this phone well.Display is amazing and feel of the phone is quite premium.

"
"

  Brought the product by exchanging the old product.Very good exchange value and smooth transaction without any hiccups.Very good job Amazon keep it up.After using for one week the product is good for multi tasking.Camera is awesome during daylight but bad during night.Redmi needs to do some software update hear.Only problem I have observed is that there is model number mismatch between the number shown in about phone section and third party app like Cpu X,Geekbench and Antutu.Redmi please look into this.

"
"

  Definitely not good for gaming . It heats a lot while playing games  . This product is made in China so you can get an idea of hardware used in the phone.Totally unsatisfied. üò´

"
"

  Too many Chinese apps keep pushing you to download more and keeps popping up notifications, not the option to delete the app, even after disabling app notification the notification still keeps popping up. But the hardware is good if bloatware doesn't bother you then it is for you.

"
"

  First of all I would like to thank Amazon for the expedited delivery.And Man..!!! They Delivered a Beast... Amazing Performance in Every category..!!Battery Life is Amazing.. I was once out for the whole day since 5am in the morning with 80% Battery.. Still it helped me throughout the day with my photography and still had 20% remaining when I was finally back in my bed at night..!!It has a Great Lens to Capture Perfect Images... Both Macros and Normal Focal length images look Stunning..!! Now it Becomes an Essential Part of My Photography Equipment..!!OS Smoothness is also an added benefit...!!#Mi

  If your budget is above 10k but less than 15k... JUST GRAB IT... you'll get :1. FULL HD+ display (in displayed camera)2. 5020 mAh insane battery backup3. 48mp quad camera üì∏4. Fast charger in the box5. Triple slot sim tray (one for memory card)JUST GRAB THE SCARLET RED COLOUR, its way too BEAUTIFUL ü§©ü§©üòçüòçü•∞ü•∞üòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

  i am not sure about gaming performance, but my dad loves it. and camera is just okay overall its good. the main thing we need is battery life which is quite good not impressive, if you want to gift a budget phone for your dad then this is fine.

"
"

  Great phone I was always a mi fan . But pricing seems to be higher. Front camera is not so good rear one performs better. If one looking for average camera performance and need good mobile operation they can choose this one. If want better camera and day to day operation suggest to go to redmi pro series

"
"

  I have switch from mi note 4 to note 9 the is just amazing battery life is OP.And after update it's lead to beast.. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç totally recommended to buy ""just the camera is over saturated but its Ok"". nice phone ftom mi in this buggest thnx amazonü§òüí™ü•∞

  Ordered two redmi note 9 phones1) Aqua Green 4gb/64gb2) Pebble Blue 4gb/64gbIt's the best phone under 12k don't miss out.(Note - the product tag will mostly be ''Made in China'') so don't panic üòÇThe both the modules that I received were with Made in China branding

  #MiI am writing my after 8 days personal experience with Redmi note 9 #miExcellent MobileBigger DisplayBigger BatteryExcellent Rear and front CameraSmooth Performance as good combination of RAM and processer.Product color is very attractive.18.5 W Fast charging Support..Less heat generated during charging and working (mostly During playing game)Everything is Good ...#mi

"
"

  Finger print reader, battery life and display are good.Battery charging is not fast,No notification light.Camera quality is not meet expectations as 48 megapixels.

"
"

  Battery drains very fast after update to miui 12. Here update occure issues instead of improvement. Even I can't downgrade as mi community site is blocked in India(If any have solution please let me know). Mi should release stable version only.Rest thing like camera and display are just okay.

"
"

  Best product... i got more than expectations.. only pune delivery station execs are one of the worst fellows... amezon sent product in time.. pune branch just slept till some days then delivered by there wish n time.

"
"

  I have rated 2stars in pebble grey and 3stars to this phone bcoz color is excellent.Request amazon to cut the scrap of sales flash.

"
"

  okay for the price. Earlier note series was much better.

"
"

  Nice and smooth mobile within this range, Camera quality is also better. Thanks Amazon for delivering the product in 24 hrs.

"
"

  Very nice phone in this price range... All specs good.... Hope that Xiaomi will start manufacturing phones in india too...

"
"

  Great phone for usual stuff, satisfied. The UI feels smooth, the display is great and the phone looks and feels premium.

"
"

  2stars only for the color and for ditching us again and again in the name of sales flash.Rest phone is good.

"
"

  A bit thicker as compared to Note 4

"
"

  Good but camera is third class

"
"

  Product is received. But, make in India (all parts made in china). its disturb in our mind. Satisfied.

"
"

  Display is okData connectivity is slow with JioBattery is okProcessor working average

"
"

  Poor battery life, and colour looks cheaper, charging speed also very low, don't buy this one.

"
"

  Outstanding buy.. Value for money again. Got it for 12500 after discount for 128GB on prime day deal

"
"

  Good in this price, having issues with mic, mic range is very limited, one cant talk properly if the mic is not near to mouth. Voice cracking while calling. ‚òπÔ∏è

"
"

  The quality of the product is not good as we had not thought the notification light is not there when charging or any notification comes. The quality of the camera is also good as we thought it was not.

"
"

  This is the best phone which I prefer for multi tasking. The speed is just awesome. I love #Mi. Thanks for making my life better. The MIUI is excellent. Amazing....

"
"

  Still working ok .. product is ok , need improvement in camera or default apps regarding

"
"

  both sim's not working. only one sim working.jio sim goesoff afte few minutes. only after restarting phone,jio sim works again for some time,the goes off

"
"

  Only disappointed due to the ''Made in China'' tag on the product otherwise if you have a budget of 12k then blindly go for it without having any second thought.

"
"

  Very plastic feel, on the heavier side. Not as good to look at as in pictures. Does not come with return policy.

  Why should a customer waste his precious time looking at clock to ring 12. And then get nothing as only very few phones are put on sale. Amazon, please stop this.

"
"

  Worst camera quality and totally disappointed with it during daylight and much more worser in low light. Just be carefull to check for made in India logo outside the box. If logo missing than it is a made in china version and I am one among such buyer that too purchased from MI store. When I verified the same with customer care, they said 70% is manufactured in India and rest 30% is still imported from China. It's not a worth to buy.

"
"

  Very bad experience.. handset is very plasticity near back camera.. plastic clicking sound comes whenever i touch..In the box i didn't receive sim ejectorHighly disappointed

"
"

  As always, these cheap chinese products look good only on paper. The specifications are huge, but performance sub par. Go for other non chinese brands.

"
"

  Too much heat...unfit to use...camera not 48mp it's 4.8mp...buy galaxy m31 or m31s instead of this..for gaming not good at all

  I will suggest please skip this phone.Camera is not up to mark 48 mp is fake.Display is full HD but the quality is very bad.Color is Awsm .If you have 1000 rupees more.. simply you Can go for Realme 6i.. far better than this phone. 12k loss

  The sound quality has degraded after miui 12 update and after using clear sound option , the sound quality has degraded to 50‚ÑÖ which is not acceptable from a world famous mobile company aka Xiaomi.
