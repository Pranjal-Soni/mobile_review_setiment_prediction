  Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.

  It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.

  Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....

  Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:‚Ä¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.‚Ä¢Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.‚Ä¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did thatüòÖ‚Ä¢Premium user-experience.‚Ä¢face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.‚Ä¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.‚Ä¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here‚úåÔ∏è*UPDATED*‚Ä¢Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)

  Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don‚Äôt panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But don‚Äôt  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.

  Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD

  I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.

  An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time.

  Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good.

  ProSmooth OS - no lags at allAMOLED screen is good quality screenPrivacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phonesAll other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviationsConNot a metal frameCPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships (this is expecetd)Note: I am releived the display is fine at low brightness - I read  some users sharing the green tint issue.  I did not face that yet.  Will update reviews in case of any issues.

  Brilliant..I have uploaded some pics of selfie as well as Portrait shot of near by shot.What is loved is phone has very good sensor.It's my first phone after my job so it's really special for me.Fine Screen..Smooth touch..Camera is beast. Selfie is beast. Screen fingerprint is smooth. Can't fine a better phone. 256gb is never ending storage.Cons:Some apps lags like gaana FacebookTouch of 90hzs is not up to what other OnePlus device have.Phone heats up while gaming for more than 20 minutes.Portrait shot blurs some area.Google lens must take pictures, macro camera is uselessNew Hydrogen update is no where to be foundI took pics with my mom dad they loved it.

"

  Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.

"

  Average phone from one plus but surprisingly very bad battery life though good battery on paper. Disappointed .

"
"

  I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the  I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.

"
"

  I have nothing to say about this product but marketing strategy. While pre-ordering this product there was no hdfc bank creditcard offer so I have to purchase it by paying full amount. But after delivery it is showing hdfc credit card discount is applicable for 12gb + 256gb variant. This is ridiculous. There's not even return option for this product. This is not at all fair to the customer who pre-ordered this product. And OnePlus and Amazon is just breaking their trust.

  OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks

"
"

  don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.

"
"

  It's very poor phone company lair battery charger 30min 70% but it's not true

"
"

  I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.

"
"

  Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied

"
"

  Where is call recording option

"
"

  Dear camera enthusiasts,Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera2. Lacks in sharp and crisp outputBetter go for OnePlus 7T

"
"

  Delivery was fast, delivered on the mentioned date. Box packing was beaten. Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times.As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience.Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account. Yet to explore the phone features and its performance. Will share it once is use it for couple of days.---------++++------After a month usage, I can rate this as most disappointing phone OnePlus has created. After few minutes in hand I can literally feel the pain due to its deisgn and weight. Biggest disappointment is the camera, out of 5 shots 3 will be blurry pixelated. Even after they pushed an update for camera still take couple of shots before you get one clear blurr free picture. You can only take still photos even a slightest movement either the phone or the person moves picture turns blurr. Phones of low resolution and less expensive take better picture then Nord.Definitely a big no to this phone. whish I could exchange it with some other phone. Maybe realme/ redmi

"
"

  Amazing design. Amazing feel. Pretty smooth. Best in its range. However, came across a bug on the first day of usage. Can't link device to redclub membership. This has been reported by multiple people on community and looks like the developers are looking into it. Apart from that the first day use has been really great. The battery is amazing. Using it since 12 hours and 40% still left.Update- The bug was fixed on the same day.

  So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ...I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit ..I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons .Pros-1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent.2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good.3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone.4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate.5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie.6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone .7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price.Cons.1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865.2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion.3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this.Personal Opinion.Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.If you find this review helpful please consider to like this review

"
"

  First look is cool.But too much weight.Not easy in use.When you open some web page or other app ,you want to go back there is not easy option to go back.12gb ram is wasted because it's working like 6gb ram mobile.My heart saying that I return this product.

"
"

  Phone 5/5Phone is fantastic, everything as expected.But the box was open. No seal on box. Though items are fine inside but might be duplicate as well. This is not a good exp for a prebooked phone.Box1/5

  I was opted for exchange with my RedMi note 7 pro to purchase OnePlus nord 8GB modal.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Bloatware free and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro‚Äôs:‚Ä¢ OxygenOS ‚Äì gives very good user experience than other android mobiles.‚Ä¢ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display‚Ä¢ Camera‚Äôs ‚Äì image processing is very good in this mobile while using back main camera, nightscape, slow motion video and front camera‚Ä¢ Stable video recording ‚Äì with Optical and electronic image stabilization‚Ä¢ Supports 5G network ‚Äì I am not sure when it is going to be launched in India (may be in 2021.?)‚Ä¢ Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset ‚Äì supports 5G network with midrange performance (excellent for daily usage)Cons:‚Ä¢ Camera‚Äôs for depth and macro photos ‚Äì especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output‚Ä¢ Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBGI don‚Äôt find more cons as of nowColor tint issue?Not found in my mobile, while screen light dims less than 20%.If your priority is not gaming, this could be considerable option.

"
"

  Received A Faulty Device As First Only And Received The phone Where Speaker Was Not Working...

"
"

  First of all I wanna thank amazon delivery service to deliver the product on right time as I want to gift it to my sister.Oneplus is a no match in this range.  You should go for this without any doubt.Except poor camera quality eveything is superb. Snapdragon 765G is fast and 90Hz display is superb. I am not getting screen tilting problem in low light as some users reported.One more low point is that it does not feel  premium as its side is made of plastic.Go for it without any second thought.I will edit my review after some days of use.

"
"

  Really very disappointed with the performance, as battery is not so good, charging time is too late as given by the company, device display quality is also not good

"
"

  Hey Guys i won't go in Specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs. I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it.Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buyingOppo Reno 4Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'.And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.

"
"

  In love with the camera quality and the color of the phone. Works smoothly. Impressed!!Also online sale is on 4th and I got it today (on 2nd). Swift delivery.

"

  Camera:selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases.Performance:Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors.Speaker:Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise.Battery:i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster.Display:great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issueVerdict:If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY.

  Waste of money , Not at all satisfied ,poor camera quality , poor product quality. Better to buy Redmi mobile ...

  I always want a oneplus mobile now I have one it's a good mobile

  Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level.As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord.  1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength  3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's  4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessingHope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users.If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!

  First things first I'm very impressed by the AMAZON delivery services.Coming to NORD It got all the hype. Easily recommendable if you use it as a regular phone for social media and business purpose. It is not so great for gamers. So think before you buy it and compare all the other options too.Last things last overall performance is very fast and enjoying the OXYGEN OS.

  It was a big jump for me from budget phone to One plus Nord! I was skeptical before buying such high price phone and that too without any discount (I bought during Amzon pre-order period, as it has to be gifted to my wife, 8/128 INR 27999/-).  But after I open the pack I felt relived. Build quality is superb and feels solid. Photo quality is plus plus...I took some photos in dark and they were crisp and clear. Colours of photos looks natural and attractive!I never looked so handsome before :-) I need more time to explore all pro features.Overall all are plus plus as of now! My wife loved the phone and thats the biggest plus :-)

  Not value for money, you are spending 30K for one plus phone but they not providing same to u. For same feature you will get in 22K phone. Only plus point is in one plus is this is 5G ready and 12Gb 256 storage phone.I have shared some pictures of Oneplus and same i have click from 18K phone Real me 6 pro. And i feel Real Realme bttr phone compair to Oneplus.

  Had lots of expectations on this device but it destroyed in an hour.1.Camera is literally bad, I mean really really bad (still I had considered this because of oxygen OS)2.Display tent issue, if you turn down the brightness below 40%)3. Fast charging doesn't at all support ( see the picture of my phone) takes more than 2 hour approximately to get full charge)4. Speaker sound is not good I would say okay.Extremely disappointed had to return this.

"

  Phone is not good. I give review correct but amazon not ready to display on web side because amazon need to sell more phone

"
"

  So I suppose I'm the first one to receive this beast from Amazon. Arrived damn early then expected!!!!Talking about phone-Display- 90hz fluid amoled display is amazing. Just can't resist to use for a longer time. 5/5Processor- Since there was lot of hype for this new SD765G which supports 5G. I'll put it this way that it supports intensive gaming as well. Played pubg and there is no lag at all and opens game in a flash. There is gaming mode for gamers. Handles everything very smoothly. 5/5Camera- Haven't tested a lot yet. Though main camera is good. Same as OP8. But other camera are not that great as one might think. They work good though and at this price you can't argue for more. It has wide angle and that is good as well. Nightmode haven't used till now. Will post that as well once I'll test that. 4/5Battery- Till now it's awesome. 4115mAh battery is sufficient for a day's work. If we include gaming you might want to charge twice a day. But again that's ok. So bang on! 5/5Charging- 30T wrap charging.. it quite fast!! 5/5UI- Who wants anything else if you get oxygen OS. Best in class and superior factor to consider OP phones. It classy. No BS at all. Authentic OP design.  5/5Design and build- Nice build, fits perfectly in hand. Gorilla glass in front and back just plastic in side and that's not an issue in anyway!! 5/5Overall it's a powerful package from OP.. I would say worth the hype!!!!Go for any color you like.. I preferred grey onyx.Box included OnePlus nord, RCC card, high quality transparent case. Case is literally very good. I just want one more case in case I need in future :p 2 yrs of confirmed OS upadte. And moreover there was already an OTA update when you switch on the device for camera and other bug fixes.Amazing work by OP!! Just awaiting for pre-order gift vouchers now!!

  1 star for the display. Green and purple tint clearly visible in daylight without even going into dark room and reducing brightness. Even the black bar is clearly visible in dark theme. My iphone 6 and oneplus 3 have a better panel than this.And 0 stars to Amazon and the seller Darshita electronics for the delay in order. Preordered on 28th and received on 8th. Whereas people who ordered on prime day sale got the phone quicker.Will never pre-order again and definitely not from Amazon.

"

  One of the worst front cameras in recent days. Apart from that, it's a deal at this price.

"
"

  Just received OnePlus Nord grey 256 gb variant and trust me guys it is just amazing,worth every rupees.

"
"

  Firstly a lot of reviews are towards the camera..... of course it's not flagship, for the price you're paying it's well worth it for a balanced experience......you can't expect it to be flagship in all levels.....if you want then buy a specific phone catered to that like rog for gaming.etc-Smooth fluidic screen movements-Fast performance 12gb ram-Decent camera with 4k feature-Speaker volume is loud and sound is clear

"
"

  Phone received today. Bought it for my mother. She seems to like it a lot. Software experience as expected is very smooth. No lags faced. Would have loved a headphone jack instead of some of the camera (only the primary rear camera is good) . Accessories are all good. Tried out the cameras with gcam mod and the results are comparable to a pixel phone (well oneplus gave decent primary front and rear camera hardware but software is bad). The battery life is good (2 hrs of video and browsing and loss of ~11% battery) so expect it to last all day for sure.

  This is one plus quality.... ....Recived in this condition..... üòî

  Pre-booked on July and got delivered in Aug4. After a day use, felt that 90Hz is added factor those who are watching 1080p movie and high-end gaming. First time charging took lot of time and second time 10mins, 80% charged from 25%.1. Primary reason for purchasing NORD is for camera spec and advertised as ""Copied from Onplus8"",but failed to impress.  I think camera is borrowed from Budget phone, ""DEFINITELY NOT FROM ONEPLUS 8"".Quality is same as Expected sharpness in image. Image is blurred while zooming. Image quality is at par with Redmi Note3.2.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS.3. Felt battery getting drained too fast for normal usage.Hope ONEPLUS is listening all NORD users concern and it will be addressed in OXYGEN OS11.

  Worst experience from OnePlus ..Phone display having serious Black bar and green tint issue which a cannot be ignored..I was a OnePlus 6T user and there is no issue with the device till now.. Dear OnePlus , It's a request from OnePlus Fan.. Requested for Return and refund and thanks to Amazon for the refunding policy..

  My Nord was delivered on 2nd August. After a week, these are my reviews.Pros1)  Fluid AMOLED Display and 90 Hz display rate gives the display exactly what your eyes need for a soothing experience (did not experience the tint issue yet).2)  After using Redmi Note 5 Pro for more than 2 years (the advertisements are hell), the Oxygen OS feels heavenly.3)  I bought the Gray Onyx version. It looks really premium.4)  The mobile is really fast and smooth.5)  You will be genuinely impressed with the face unlock speed with this mobile. The fingerprint scanner was also fairly fast (I really liked the various ways you could customize fingerprint unlock animations; the cosmos one is pure love).6)  My mom has Oppo A5 2020, and this mobile is smaller than that one. This set feels surprisingly handy (which really goes with the lightweight build of this mobile).7)  This is my first OnePlus, so the charging cable and the adapter really impressed me. (Charging speed results done by me when the mobile was switched off and was at 0% : 50% at 24 minutes, 61% at 30 minutes (9% short of their claim), 80% at 41 minutes, 100% at 58 minutes).8)  Again, my first OP, so the Alert slider impressed me as well.9)  Not a pro gamer, but this mobile has a FNATIC mode for games. Yet to test what it actually does, but my gaming experience was fairly good.10)  The zen mode. I liked this touch a lot. Reminds us that there is a life outside of your mobile too (go talk with your family and have a nice chat with them).11)  The reading mode. Again, another thing I liked (pardon me if these are common features in mobiles of this range). I read a lot, and I don't like ebooks much. But even when you are scrolling down Google learning about the life cycle or genetic composition of the Coronavirus, the black and white mode feels soothing to the eye.Neutral1)  For camera, which I know is a prime requirement for many, please look into other reviews. I am not a voracious camera user, so my views on this would be unfair to you readers. The only review I can give is that, in low light, while taking a photo, if your hand shakes, the picture comes a little hazy.Cons1)  Battery. Yes. Many people in the OnePlus community have raised this issue as well. I will just write down my issues. If you use the mobile normally, the mobile should go on for a day (that is, you will have to charge it once a day). Even if you play games, the battery tries to handle itself, and I would call that performance average.However, if you switch on Hotspot, battery drains like a flowing river downhill a mountain. I have some tasks that I do in the laptop, and I do not have a ethernet connection, so this is an issue for me. Kindly keep this in mind.2)  You knew this was coming. The 3.5 mm jack that everyone loves.3)  Although the speaker is loud, stereo speakers would have been better.4)  Not an issue for me, but yes, you can get better processors at this price (Realme X2 pro, for example).5)  Again, not an issue for me, but no SD card support. (The lack of SD card support and 3.5 mm jack is becoming prevalent, it seems).6)  I wish the frame wasn't of plastic, but it is (Although the buttons are of metal).ConclusionI can not emphasize much how much I am liking this mobile. If you like watching anime, movies, or even youtube, the screen will feel like a bliss.Among the 6 cons I have written, I can still live with 5 of them, but the battery draining issue is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. My Redmi Note 5 Pro handled being a Hotspot better than this mobile. I don't know if it is possible to fix this by an OTA update.I sincerely request all users of OP Nord to check their battery backup. You can comment below if you want to.Note: All of these are personal reviews. Thank you for reading quite a long review. You won't regret buying this, that is for sure.

  Writing the review after a month's usage and phone works really fine and no lag at allPros- display is really awesome with 90hz smooth and fast refresh rateOxygen OS experience is awesomeFast charging i.e charges upto 70% in 35 minsVideo quality is great due to OISCamera quality has improved than the beginning due to the time to time updates by OnePlusFingerprint reader and face unlock works fastMobile network and calling is really good in low network areasCons- No headphone jackBattery drains really fast when used continuously for long timeFront camera doesn't seem to be 32mp and could be better with software updates

  Worst service ever, after 10 days of purchase, I got software problem in my  phone (phone stuck in oneplus logo) , I clem for warranty but service center told  me 20000 Rs Bill for software issue, without my permission he heated my mobile, and asking for payment for mobile, now phone in my showcase. I purchased phone in 28000rs now what should I do

"
"

  First let me clarify this: ""Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media"" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever!Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don't bother with it's presence/absence.Oxyzen OS as always is ‚ù§Ô∏è. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product.Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it.Overall impression: Good phone if you get it for 25k (8GB ram variant)

  Display tint issue in my modelAmazon refused to replace my phone.

  Issue list:1. During phone call screen get locked and you have to unlock again to do anything like disconnect call.2. After every call you will get notification of phone getting updated.3. Battery drain drastically. From 100% to 90% in 7 mins. (Not using any heavy apps. By just screen on).4. Heating issues. Heats for just using messages, what's up and phone calls too. While charging it heats upto 45¬∞ C. So battery is going to get damaged very very soon.5. Call logs missing. Last week call logs are also missing.6. Bluetooth disconnect issues with headphones,buds,health tracker watches or any other Bluetooth devices. Quite embarrassing.7. YouTube videos stuck halfway,not because of internet. That means video(visual stuck) and voice goes on. Like old TVs.8. Wifi speed is low. Laptop shows 40 speed and Nord speed is 18 speed. Other mobile shows 38 speed.9. Messages will be delivered late. OTP get received after few hours sometime.10. Only few apps are permitted to have parallel apps. Mostly very generic. But if you need any specific app you can't.11. Charger and red cable type C pin also  heats up high during charging.12. Camera do not open sometimes.13. You have to Click and wait for photo to be captured without blur both front and back cameras.14. Even if you do point 13. Still photos are not upto mark and night photos not atall upto mark.15. OnePlus Nord is not tested mobile in Market. OnePlus don't agree but if it is tested then why there are so many issues.Deficiency list:1. No 3.5mm Jack.2. Display tint issues. 90% devices have it.3. No external memory slot.4. No infrared to use as a remote of your TV and music system,smart light at home.5. OnePlus Oxygen OS Contacts and Phone dialer apk is missing. And Google contacts and dialer has lot of issues and they are not stable.6. OnePlus Oxygen OS message apk is missing.7. Oxygen OS phone contacts, dialer and messages apks are actually signature of Oxygen OS without which Oxygen OS is clearly incomplete like half meal.8. Plastic body.9. No Automatic call recording. Big deficiency.When talked to OnePlus they gave 100 reasons for deficiencies on this OnePlus Nord. No reason is sounds satisfactory. Mostly every reason OnePlus gave is silly excuse.This is a consolidated list. If you see anything missing please add in comments.All my issues I have raised with OnePlus bit nothing turned out to be resolved.Visited  OnePlus services center nothing resolved. Discussed  with OnePlus customer care, feedbacks given complaints given for each issue given to them with logs, screenshot and what all OnePlus has asked for. I have spent many many hours to inform OnePlus about each and every issue of the above mentioned issues.So please don't reply back to me to reach OnePlus team. This post it here because OnePlus did absolutely nothing to resolve these.Dirty truth of the scenario.

  Good phone best camera with many modes just after getting phone got a update warp charging was fast enough display was the highlight front camera was not soo good but it was okay with its quality got it delivered today on the whole it is the best buy mobile at a very reasonable rate i got a 12gb variant which was very fast

"
"

  Pre ordered and waited like anything... Arrived on time. Everything is fantastic in Nord except Display color leak or I don't know what to call it. I shared images and videos, go through it. Why why why faulty products?

"
"

  First i was confused as review by Youtubers. But i can say this is best phone in this segment OnePlus oxygen OS is dam smooth with simple and clean UI.. Camera works excellent and don't go with hype of blue marble it look like realme types.. Grey color looks like Flagship OnePlus .. 50 minutes Full charging ... PUBG is working good ping is also decent while playing...

"
"

  If you are buying for camera, then my suggestion is don't buy this phone because compared to one plus 6, photos are getting blured in Nord.

"
"

  I like that phone very much. It is smooth , good audio and video. I missed one thing here is no audio jack. Today is day one will update our review in 1-2 weeks.Day 26 here is my review . Phone is super smooth . first week I feel battery is dying to fast but there is an software which is now fixed with update now I am getting full day battery backup. I play pubg alot with no lags and frame drop. There is no issue with display like other people are saying about nord. My experience is awesome with this phone.

  Dont fall for oneplus marketing and hype..I recieved a damaged oneplus nord as i unboxed.. back cover was seperated from the frame and there was a black patch on it.. the phone too never switched on..The irony is, oneplus claims on their website""Droped. Shocked. Shook. Sunburned."" ""We take quality seriously"" but their phone was ripped apart inside the box itself. A dead phone in the end. They fooled us! Infact if u research nord also is facing display and bluetooth issues besides inferior construction which i got to know after i had already made a purchase. Guys i am no one to say dont buy oneplus.. u have to be wise enough to take that call.. but all i can say that dont fall into their trap of marketing and hype they create. Be wise and dont be fooled!

  I was totally devastated after i received the product as it was a defective one. Its getting hanged and switched off multiple times automatically. And after all these stuff i dont kno whether my product will be replaced. Very very  poor from amazon.

  My Nord Journey with Amazon:-15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ‚Çπ499.18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers.28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ‚Çπ29999.05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start.Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon.** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone.Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use.Pros :‚úì Oxygen OS with latest Android 10.‚úì Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back.(U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality).‚úìBrighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate.‚úì Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography.‚úì Duel selfie camera.‚úì Light weight and easy to grip.‚úì 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates.‚úì Battery backup is quite good.‚úì5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment.‚úì Both Sim working fine.‚úì Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z. No connectivity issue.‚úì No heating issue noticed during use.‚úì 30 W Warp charger. Charging speed similar to OP 8 Pro.‚úì Fingerprint scanner is very fast.Cons :‚úì Minor Display issue. A negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition.(Not lucky 2nd time. After received a perfect OP 8 Pro with no display issue). Hope it will solve by software update as OnePlus already mentioned it in their community page.‚úì Need improvement in low light photography on front camera.‚úì All 4 side pannel were made by plastice meterial, so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it. Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case.‚úìNo Dolby Atmos.‚úìNo 3.5 mm jack.## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro...

  Display itself not working!!  Did not expect this from oneplus !!!!How did it pass QA and delivered to customer if the display itself not turning on ?????I got my mobile through pre booking and returned it. When i asked about replacement, they said there is no replacement stock eventhough regular stocks are on sale. Worst mobile buying experience ever !!!!!!!!!!

"
"

  Just got the mobile..1st impression - minimal design, no useless app, got the os update... But ! The camera ! Not statisfied.. currently I'm using Poco F1.. even though the Nord has quad rear cam with latest sensor, but the images are too grainy.. my Poco F1 produces much more better image..This is within 2hours review after having the product.. I'll update further after using it sometimes..

  Nice phone but the green tint issue is very noticeable on 50 percente brightness and is annoying the why 2 stars. Rest of good. Also photos in artificial light give a very pale colour to skin

  While charging, Video calling , simple Net browsing (separately)There is no Return/Replace policy for defective products as inspection guy says Amazon will fetch money from his pocket if he allows replacement and amazon is not satisfied with the issue...So indirectly no one will take risk to approve these internal issue as they are afraid what if amazon doesnt get satisfied .. like how i was not able to satisfy the inspection guy.. its all about inspection guys wish .. if he wants then only your issue will get resolved ..else you have to live with the defective product.

  Well let's talk about the Features and performance of the phone first of all I Pre ordered this phone and it is my first OnePlus device I am using it and the best thing I like in this phone is that the OxygenOs which is buttery smooth and no lag and I was testing this device since 1 week and the over-all performance of this phone is very good only processor is a bit less like we should expect a flagship processor like Snapdragon 855 but in terms of pricing they choose 765g with 5g ready for future proof , let's talk about the camera quality well I was testing the camera and it is lit trust me the colors and pixels are bright and good like daylight pictures are just fabulous! For the gaming I don't find any lag issues or heating issues And the 1080p recording is just smooth and stable I have tested the stability of the video and it is superb. Let's talk about the display now - this amoled display is awesome and 90hz screen refresh rate makes everything buttery in terms of scrolling up and down! And the haptic feedback is also great while typing.. let's talk about some Cons- Could have go for Snapdragon 855 , Plastic frame doesn't make this phone premium , no headphone jack.Overall I would rate this phone 9.5 out of 10. :)

"
"

  After using it for several days,I noticed some issues1) Image processing is taking time(more than usual)2) After clicking a image you need to keey your hand stable for a while, otherwise the image will get blurred3) Low light photography is very poor4) Battery is draining faster even in 60Hz refresh rate.5) Sometimes networks drops are there, you'll lost internet connection for seconds and it'll restore after it.But all of these issues can be resolved by update and OnePlus is very concerned about their customers,as they keeps asking for issues in their community page.Buy it if you're not a gamer or not into phography and want balanced and smooth device.

  Almost everything you get under 30k price range... Oxygen OS is the best android skin right now... Experiencing it under 30k is a deal breaker...There are other smartphones with Snapdragon 800 series processors under 30k.. but not all of them are bloatware free except OnePlus...Buy this phone if you love to have a nice UI, great display, good camerasAbsolutely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a phone under 30kProvding a headphone jack to type-c  would have been very good

  After reading other reviews, I think most of the people here were looking for a flagship phone for a 28-30k price tag. For me, I've been upgrading my phone almost every couple of years and that too from flagship to flagship. I got Nord after 6T and there's a huge difference in both phones, I'll mention my pros and cons :-Pros-‚Ä¢OnePlus is a company that listens to it's customers, there were minor bugs in the software which were fixed in an update I got after using the phone for a week.‚Ä¢The Oxygen OS feels fast (compared to 6T) paired with 90hz display and Snd765G, people there are 4 memory channel instead of 2 which is usually the case in Snd845 and travelling speed varies due to that.‚Ä¢The phone looks and feel premium as promised, you wouldn't even feel the plastic body and unless you're super strong or a rough user, don't buy this phone. (Remember a time when almost every phone was made of plastic)‚Ä¢The display is a lot better than OP 6T even though on paper they've the same display the color density per ppi is higher in Nord (One of the underrated feature for OP 2020 phones)‚Ä¢The phone is made in India even though the company is Chinese it is still employing people in India and if you're not a target of 25% increased unemployment rate, lucky you.‚Ä¢The Software is as fresh as it can get and I can't already wait for November to get Always-on-Display and Android 11.Cons-‚Ä¢The camera is performing great but I'm sure it's not flagship performance, instead of complaining I can wait for updates and as you can see in pixel series, software of the camera matters too.‚Ä¢After a week of usage I feel the battery is same as the 6T but as mentioned above Android 11 would most probably fix that.That's it for me, I think most bad reviews here are unjustified and doesn't give the a fair review to the phone. People using MI or Poco or Vivo or whatever, I don't think there's any company that listens to it's customers like OnePlus does. (Even Samsung can't move Brisby button even though everyone hates it) Look online and look for OP ideas website, the company genuinely cares about it's customer unlike most companies. Here you're paying for an almost flagship experience and the company delivers it exceptionally well. Hope my Review was helpful and it helps you enjoy your new phone

  Never thought OnePlus brand can degrade this low on camera quality. You will definitely be disappointed with the performance of both front and rear cameras. Instead of 2 at the front and 4 at the rear they should have given atleast on proper camera to do the job. Disappointed..why oneplus why...

  ¬†I found so many glitches in this phone. Instagram doesn't work properly, the phone gets hung while using different apps. It's not a fun phone at all. I'm totally disappointed. For your information, I still haven't inserted my sim cards for it to be this bad

  Phone is ok but some drawback..

"
"

  Reviews after using phone 2-3 days -Pros - premium build quality, you will feel it.Awesome look.Touch very smooth & fast.Full charge in 1 hour.And everything is working fine like gaming, email, office works, calling, ane other apps.Rear camera excellent, detailed picture quality.12gb ram - other than gaming, you will feel it while transferring heavy data from one folder to other in seconds.Cons - little bit heavy (phone weight)Ftont camera is same as other one plus and samsung phones, if someone using oppo,vivo ,poco phn then he will feel front camera is not clear because it's show real image not filtered.Phone width is little less in mm as compared to other OP phones.

  Following is my review of the device -PROS -1. The display is amazing.2. Oxygen OS is really clean, good, and easy to use.3. The Alert Slider button is helpful.4. Charging is fast ( not as much as Realme X2 pro but quite fast)CONS -1. The camera is bad, really bad. Only on daylighting the back primary camera can take good pics, all the other cameras are useless in the back. Wide-angle lens shoots really soft pictures, you cant zoom or crop the picture or it turns grainy. Depth and macro are just place holders. They are of no good use.2. Performance is okayish, you won't feel any lag in normal usage, but scrolling through twitter feed or google news feels starts showing lags and jerks. Camera after clicking the picture ( after shutter sound, and a small image showing at the lower corner ), it still needs 1 more second to click the picture properly. you need to keep the camera in the same position even after clicking the pic for 1 more second or the pictures are blurry.3. Speaker is not good, high in volume but low in clarity, if you push the volume for more than 60% it starts cracking.4. Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM ( without gaming) but my phone is defective and has some charging issue, not sure whether the battery performance is because of the same, waiting for a replacement .If you are ready to spend 28-30k and you really want OnePlus device and are ready to sacrifice with the sub-par camera setup, then go ahead else try to look out for other devices.

  Over all I am happy to be the owner of oneplus Nord but below some negative points please must see before buying if you are heavy userFingarprint reader is ok , camera is not upto mark for 30k mobileIf a say about life than its not good if you are using with 90h screen refresh rate and white screenBut battery is decent(good) if using with 60h refreshrate and dark modeI am not a heavy user but battery running for one day after doing settingsIf accidentally it is dropped due to plastic frame it will brake down not durable today 25 aug 20 happened with me

  Loved the device! What OnePlus said it delivered. it's snappy and feels fast.The Screen is Great!I got 5:30 SOT day 1 and it charged pretty fast as well (Poweroff - 50mins, Poweron - 60mins)I did a little stress test from my end running multiple heavy applications and running benchmarks as well, it's temperature increased only about 3-4%, quite impressive.UFS 2 is a drag, and the cameras are overhyped, they are good, but not as advertised.Would suggest this phone to anyone coming from a mid-range device and want a flagship-like feel.The closest competitors for this device are -> Pixel 4a and iPhone SE.Lastly, ""Nord is an experience, not just any other mere device you buy"".

  Very very bad performance , i upgrade to my mi a1 that was brilliant Mobile the one plus Nord is bad performance and camera fully unclear photos front and rear camera also

  Worst product

  A descent mobile....feels premium.....awesome display with 90 hrz referesh rate. Fingure scanner lightening fast. Front camera clarity is amazing however back camera needs some software improvement especially for low light photography and portrait mode. Fast charging takes approximately 35 minutes from 0 to 100. Design could be better with camera module at centre or square shape camera module at top left....better discharge faster....overall a good mobile phone.

  I ordered OnePlus Nord 12gb ram+ 256gb rom on 6th August morning and it reached to me on 10th August.The display of this phone is excellent, I just loved the movie experience will watching prime video, the colours were really asm.The speaker of this phone, not having a stereo speakers set up, but honestly the speaker is very loudThe camera of this phone:Under artificial lightRear pictures with both ultra wide and main camera are descent enough but the selfies lack detailing.Videos with rear main camera is good but not with ultra wide, it is just average and videos with front camera are just asm.Natural lightVideos and pictures with both cameras are really very good and has a good dynamic rangeThe nightscape and macro mode/camera are just waste, the main camera performs better than nightscape and macro cameraA suggestion that better use g cam for front camera and nightscape mode, pictures with g cam with front and nightscape are better than stock cameraThe pre-appplied screen protector has a descent quality and the back case quality is good.The charging speeds are excellent, I got 0-100 in 1 hr and about 0-65 in 30 mins.I just played coc and not pubg or cod or freefire on it, so don't know the about how the gaming performance, but I think it will have a descent gaming performance.The oxygen os is just smooth and I had a good experience with itThe connectivity with my tws is excellent, but just facing problem when I first connect it, automatically Amazon music starts playing the last played song by me, don't know what's the problem, hope OnePlus fixes it with update.There is know ipx rating, but u will not face any problem with minor issues and the bulid quality is nice, doesn't look that much premium as I expected.The weight of the phone is very less and it is easy to use it with one hand.I didn't faced any issue will calling, the inbulit microphone is nice.The 90 Hertz display is good.And yes, it has green tinting issue but u can only see it at minimum brightness while seeing something in dark mode type and in a dark room, it is not that much greenish type, honestly it's very very much light coloured (green), I just tested the screen, but I didn't saw tinting issues in normal usage, I think the the tinting issue is just negligible for u to buy it.All the things are good except some camera modes, and hope OnePlus would fix it with an update, till then u can use G Cam + Stock cam.All the above it's a very good balanced phone having all the needy features with a good quality at low quality and plus it is a 5G phone.If u want a good and balanced phone under 25k to 30k, OnePlus nord is the best, do not even look at the other brands like redmi, realme,etc.And if u want a phone where ur main prefrence is only and only gaming then OnePlus nord is not for u, checkout the other high performance phones with 800 series chip.Overall the OnePlus Nord is a very good phone with all the best features u want and a descent gaming experience.And it is a value for money smartphone!And I ordered the blue marble colour, which I just liked the most and the design of the phone is also good.

  One plus Nord has some issues like Google home search and as well as Google assistant doesn't work some time and Phone dial üìû shows updating.Call recording were not getting saved.

  Generally i don't write negative feedback. But this phone really has screen issue. The screen reflects in bands of green and pink. This is mainly visible in white backgrounds. It strains eyes. Want to return this phone.

  There is no relationship quite like the one between me and my dad,Today on the Prime Day early morning we had our delivery agent standing at our door steps with the gift i ordered for my ¬®DAD¬®.I had been thinking of gifting something special to my dad on his birthday..I was one of the first ones who were waiting for the pre-booking sale to open for :-OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage)Amazing product !! Amazing Price !!! Amazing Features!!!!I could see tears in my fathers eyes when he opened the package,  the feel can not be expressed in words.I Learned one new thing that Sometimes Gifts can convey a lot more than words..Thanks to Jeff Bezos for developing such a network which could connect relation's and bring Happiness...!!!Thank You Amazon..

  Really good looking phone which feels premium in hand (exept the sides which are made of plastic)Camera is awesome. Don't look the reviews, their standards are way high. For an average user, you will definately get a flagship level experience.Performance awesome.Display is beutiful to look at.The best thing about this phone is you feel good while writing something,the touch response is top-tier.You will definately get phones much cheaper than this with better spec sheet but let me tell you, having a oneplus phones feels good, buying a mi or oppo phone of 50000 will still be mi and oppo phones as they are known for their cheap phones.And OnePlus phones last and I mean they last long. I previously had OnePlus X(5 years old) and it still works fine exept for battery. Hence you can easily use this phone for atleast for 5 years. That for me is good enough.

"
"

  After one month usage I am writing this review.Finger print reader is ok ok.Battery life is short but also charges faster.Main camera quality is ok. Zoom quality is ok.Front camera is bad. Pixels gone busted when you zoom the imagesFacing hardware problems like hanging the apps and stops working. Not good for multitasking.Overall just ok, not as good as described.No automatic call recording option.

"

  A lot of people have given their expert opinions here so I'm just gonna address a few things.1)Display:- Yes there is a tint issue but I feel Oxygen Os 10.5.7.AC01DA has solved it to an extent.My recommended setting isDisplay calibration>Advanced>Display P3 and tone it down to cold.2)Camera:- I seriously don't know why people are soooo critical about the cameras. I know it's not that great but it's not that bad either. People are paying half the price of one plus flagships and expect the same quality(though both 1+8 and nord have the same primary camera.lol). Of course they are gonna bring improvements but  it's not going to exceed some people's expectations.3)Battery life:- It's not that great. It's mainly due to that 90hz refresh rate.P.S:-Not attaching any photos there are enough of them here üòÇ

"
"

  I've been following this phone to buy ever since they started the project hoping it would be good...WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT EXPECT..1. A Flagship level gaming performance2. A Flagship Quality camera3. That it will be super easy living without 3.5mm because I still find it a bit difficult to get used to(but it's a worthy trade-off)WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT...1.  A Flagship quality performance in terms of day to day usage because the bloatfree OxygenOS makes sure you do2. A beautiful Display with a must have refresh rate3. All day battery with proper fast charge...( A lot of people might be expecting a better battery life but if you are using 90hz it will be like this no matter which company you use )4. I meant proper because most of the phones get hot while fast charging but this didn'tOverall It is a phone which is a perfect daily driver with a good gaming performance and If you believe a phone is more than what the spec sheet says then this is for you.P.S. Disappointed with Amazon delivery...Preordered phone took 10 days after shipping to get delivered after shipping while an usual order takes 3 days.

  After 1moth I am writing this  review. I  Never wrote this type of negative reviews. Please do not believe all YouTubers reviews. Sorry to say this points. I only faced or others also faced  these type problems I don't know.1.One day suddenly all data erresed and got updated. So carefull.(I am very disappointed for this because I am not gamer only official and daily use.)2.For me no tint issue. Display is good.3.in our family bought 6-7 mobile we did not face any problem apart from this mobile.4.They ony created big hipe and over advertisement.5.There are many mobiles with good proccecer and software for this price range.6.I hope OnePlus will solve this software issue otherwise they will loose people faith7.Call quality signal strength no issues.8.After sudden reset now I am facing battery drainag and mobile heat issues.(Before my mobile was very cool and no battery drainag issues now i am facing this new problem)If solve software issue that's great ( I sent mail also)I will update my  reievw. But friends think think twice before buying because we are spending hard earned money it's should not go waste thank you

  ¬†after using for 7-8hrs the screen got glitches all over the screenand also the shipping package wasn't packed with damage proof cartoon box, it was just the phone under the plastic cover, even the edges of the phone box were damaged.

  The look and feel is very good.. the phone is very compact, handy and also felt light weight. I was previously using Asus 5Z and Vivo Z1x..First time user of Oxygen OS and I am loving it.. no unwanted ads and apps. Butter smooth performance. There are a few Facebook related apps which can be deleted by connecting the phone with laptop.. u can find this info in xda developers website.The 765G processor does a decent job.. I play games (PubG and COC) for about 3-4 hours a day.. and was spending more time on the camera for the past 3 days..Battery drains fast as I have nothing else to do other than fiddling with this phone all the time.. once the work life becomes normal the battery should be enough for 1 day.. as of now am charging for 2 times a day. Charging is fast with the 30W charger.I am a fan of black colour and first time I purchased a different colour the Blue Marble.. I was initially thought of canceling the order to swith the colour to Gray Onyx.. later thought I can try something new.. good that I did not cancel the order.. The Blue Marble is fantastic and gives a premium look..For those who expect a very fast shutter speed and image optimization dont go for Nord.. it normally takes about 2 seconds for the image to optimize and then display the actual image in portrait mode.. in nightscape mode it will take about 5 seconds.. I dont mind waiting for 2 or 5 seconds though.. There is a blink in slow-motion videos when you are in low light but I think it is the case with all the phones. The pictures are very nice.. I am sharing few pictures here.. The 2MP Macro lens could have been removed.. there is no use of it..As far as Gaming, I did not find any lag or heating issue.. if u r going to use the plain case that comes with the mobile, then u might feel a slight discomfort playing pubg.Display is very nice.. I did not have any Tint issue with my device or may be it was fixed with the recent update that was rolled out.

  I bought 8gb ram variant.  let's talk about pros ans cons -1. Battery life - battery drains too fast. However it has fast charging as well. But you need to charge your phone very often. For 100% battery it last up to 7 hours on screen. That's pretty low when you are into phone all time2. Front camera - picture quality is average. Not that great. Biggest drawback is after clicking selfie you need to be still for atleast 2-3 seconds. There's a lag between when you click pic and when it captures your image. And that's really annoying. Another major drawback poor quality in low light.3. Back/Rear Camera. Picture quality is good, also in dim light.4. Gaming - pubg. It runs smooth with graphics5. Fingerprint. - i am first time using on screen finger print and i am not liking it at all. Again it takes seconds to response. Arrgghh... annoying when you are in hurry.All over, better go for flagship phone. It is not worth spending money. I feel like i can get same features or better features in some other brand in lesser price.

  One of the best in segment. Don't get distracted by the screen tinting issue. It's yhe Amoled property which is nothing to do with the quality of the product and it won't be hamper your day to day usage. You'll barely notice this unless you want to see it. Despite being mono speakey, the sound it much louder. And above all 90hz refresh rate with oxygen OS is a total bliss and no other android will give you this heavenly experience. The battery is draining a little quick but I think it's because of 90hz and maybe battery optimization will be done in future OTA updates. About cameras, macto and depth cameras are useless as it's not the one that you'll use. Otherwise they are good

"
"

  Got this nord in Amazon pre order . Nord is absolutely a good choice for a best android experience and the gray onyx colour is so good than Blue marble .the 90hz display experience looks like a flagship . The wide angle camera is best at its rate .overall 8.7/10

"
"

  USP of 5G but not even running at a level of 3G. I'm so frustrated of this phone. Being everything fast and snappy, if you're restricted on connectivity, all the fun fades away. The network connection is so lost away, its very hard to connect to the internet. Although its faster than the usual 4G but only after its connected. I literally feel of breaking this phone several times a day. This reminds me of very old tech products which used to work only when you slap or hit it hard. Pathetic!

"
"

  Super phone in this time this rang All in one....in oneplus nord

"
"

  Oneplus created the hype and asked people to prebook it. I prebooked on 18th July and then again on 28th July and received the product on 9th August. I mean then why that prebook drama.After that the phone comes out to be an average phone. They claimed that it has flagship level camera, trust me 10k phones click better photos. Above all that no clarification on prebooked benefits and how to claim. Shame

"
"

  Received the product today, my few cents:Pros:1) The processor is superfast and touch feel is really awesome.2) Back Camera is like any other 20k+ phone camera, good, but front camera quality is good during vide calls3) Build design is good and the new OS features are also good. Not gone thru all of them, the ones that are explored are good4) Battery - 100% Charged in the morning 10AM, after 8 hours at 6PM, 60% left which means it might come for 1+ day. Since the setup operations takes lots of juice, you can judge on your own.Cons:1) Fingerprint Setup is pathetic, the old fingerprint sensor is way better then this on screen one. You have to literally scroll your finger in all 8 dimensions for about 16 times before it completes the setup. Its lame in terms of technoligical advancement.2) Fingerprint recognization is okay.. not as good as the old sensors in 3T and other OnePlus models.

"
"

  It doesn't seem like that camera is stolen from OnePlus 8.... Worst experience with camera...this phone is about nothing , but only the hype they have created in the market...it's better to ban these Chinese phones... I'm not even satisfied with the display... It doesn't look like a amoled... I heard a lot about oneplus., So I've tried it for the first time, but totally different from what I've heard... Waste of money....in this segment (30k) we r getting a lot better phones... Think twice before you buy this phone..

"
"

  ¬†Loved the size and weight of the phone. The metallic finish and slim body makes it feel top of the world, for such a budget phone packed with multiple features that i shall be exploring on the go. The back cover is quite decent but okay but the most important fact is it has a waterproof protection over the charging point, which is the best part from a usability aspect. Above all the picture quality is very natural and most importantly just like iPhone without any additional filters that takes away the charm. Other than than that it is paacked with multiple camera features, that'll blow your mind.Most importantly the broad smile and happiness over my daughters face was priceless. What else could a proud dad expect from such a valueable product.

  Okay. So, firstly, horrible delivery by Amazon india. I placed the order on 30th July. It got shipped on 12th August and was delivered by 16th. This review will be completely unbiased and will come from an user who used vivo v15 pro beforehand.Like all of you, I also believed that Nord did not live up to the hype by seeing it get criticised by reviewers. But, trust me, this midranger gives you the same premium feeling as you would expect in a flagship device. (Not joking, it's beautiful). Obviously if you come from a device like OnePlus 6,7,8 it's a downgrade, no doubt. I wanted to buy the 7t for it's features and processor, but I bought the Nord. Why ?1) 10k cheaper than 7t.2) Better selfie camera composition.3) Same bloatware free oxygenOS.4) 90Hz fluid AMOLED display. (trust me guys, it's buttery smooth. I found it brighter than my vivo and way smoother due to the 90Hz panel. You will get addicted to the display).5) sd 765g : Day to day tasks like swiping , moving through apps is as fluid as found on higher premium OnePlus devices. (I compared the swiping speeds with 7t pro, it could catch up with the 7t pro). I'm not a heavy gamer. I usually keep my gaming sessions short like for 10 mins at a stretch and I'm done. I noticed zero frame drops playing COD, it ran very smooth. No lags.5) Build quality : I don't know why so much people are making a fuss over the plastic frame. I used an unibody cheap plastic built v15 pro and coming from that, the NORD felt VERY premium in my hands. It is really compact, inhand feel is awesome. You can feel it's a premium device when you hold it. Stop believing crap like the phone feels less premium due to it's plastic frame. We wouldn't even know it was plastic unless it was clarified by OnePlus.6) User interface: Coming from a trash funtouchOS, the oxygenOS is heavenly. It runs apps very smoothly and really fast. No complaints.7) I don't know how many people would want to know but the ultrawide angle selfie cam is pretty useful. It helps.8) Super linear bottom firing mono speaker: The speaker has way more better clarity and loudness than my v15 pro. Yes, it's definitely not loud as the 7t /8/7t pro. But it's loud enough. Would not complain.Here's what I do miss tho:-1) I really miss the headphone jack. I don't have money to buy TWS rn. So I do, dearly miss the headphone jack.2) I expected ufs 3.0 storage. But 2.1 is okay, you wouldn't notice if you aren't that nitpicky.3) The camera quality I would say , for an all-arounder star device like the Nord, it's okayish. It gives you really good day light pictures with decent details. It won't disappoint you in any aspect if daylight pictures are concerned. The pictures look natural, not artificially boosted and punched like vivo phones. The ultra wide sensor gives you really good colors and you won't really find any difference until you zoom into that picture for details. I could get very good(if not the best) portrait shots and the macro camera, well it's useless. Don't use it. Overall, I know OnePlus will definitely improve the camera on this through regular software updates.4) unpopular opinion : Even if a premium phone with better cameras and a flagship processor comes out in the market, I would prefer oxygenOS rather than choosing any of the realme, miuis,etc .

  Chennai, ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Øç‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ, India.I was worried about negative reviews on battery, camera, and display issues but I don't find any. It delivers what is promised. After 3 hours of handling, I wanted to write a quick review who are ordered and worried just like me because of negative reviews.I pre-ordered the OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage). After a long wait, it was delivered today 13 Aug 2020. After 5 years of OnePlus 2 I now finally upgraded to OnePlus Nord. Highly satisfied with Nord!!I will post an update after a week's usage.

"
"

  I personally feel that this is a very good product in this range. The battery lasts almost for two days with average usage (No Gaming involved). Camera quality is good unless if you want to go and zoom it till the last pixel (Not sure why you want to do that) as the inbuilt camera software tries enhance the image and fails in doing so (Only in case of Full image Zoom). Else the image quality is great at this range. Sound quality is good. Overall its a good product for daily use for everyone.

"
"

  Hello,I got this phone on 3rd of August, one day before its official launch, and it has been wonderful experience.Although when I opened the box I did see a bubble on the screen underneath so that took be aback (Its still there).The phone charges in appx 60 mins (With more usage gradually it will increase no doubt abt that). But being a moderate user the battery lasts for about 1.5 days which is quite good.As far as performance is concerned this is phone is much better than Google Pixel 4A or Iphone SE in the same price bracket. Hands down. Apps open up really fast no lagging at all. No heating issues as well till now.

"
"

  Bought this one after seeing the specs online and price looked so good. But it didn't meet my expectations. If you're a frequent user , gamer or does something like plays poker in mobile then 100% this is not the phone for you, the reason I'm saying this because of its battery backup though it claims 4135 battery but it lasts only 4-5 hours of continuous uses after a full charge and worst case is in any activity wheather you're playing games, watching videos, talking it drains the same amount of battery. Ofcourse the fast charger is there but why would someone charge their phone 3 times a day. The could have definitely offer better battery backup. Camera is really average don't expect it to capture shots. The only thing i like about the phone is it's screen. Sound quality is pretty good too. Overall a 3star. I hope they fix the battery issue somehow.

"
"

  Best phone under 30k. It's a common sense that at this price one plus would not provide all features of one plus 8. Some YouTubers also speak irrelevant things about this phone. They are blindly against the phone. But, as per my opinion it's a great deal till now in phone market in India if one considers all aspects of the phone.

"

  Search, compare, compare, and compare again to all its competitors. Nord will stand out always. You need to understand that this is an upper midrange flagship and not a complete premium phone. Unless you are Rahul Gandhi, you should be able to understand that you cannot expect a complete premium experience but Nord gets you as close as possible to it in terms of features, build, display, and after-sales support. So, without thinking twice, go ahead with this. I have been a part of 1+ community for almost 7 years now, and I can definitely say if you are on a tight budget and cannot afford Oneplus 8/8pro, THIS IS THE ONE YOU HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR ALWAYS.

"

  It‚Äôs not what every YouTuber is saying. It‚Äôs absolutely not like the magic Oneplus One was. The other two siblings of OnePlus Nord I have used as my secondary devices were Oneplus C and Oneplus 3T and both were amazing devices and are still with me. NORD is light weight good looking phone with ordinary AMOLED Screen and speaker.  I am not a gamer so it doesn‚Äôt matter how it performs there. No complaints from camera either but nothing great about it too. I also made a mistake of buying it in blue color. It‚Äôs so jarring that it started irritating me in a day. Another blunder- I started using blue sandstone case and I felt like throwing up. Now it‚Äôs in black color sandstone case and looks okay. So I suggest buy its black/grey color. There is no option of returning it unfortunately. And if you are coming from iPhone don‚Äôt even go close to it. You will hate it the way I do.

  Straight to the point phone is good , ordered on 28th July , in promoting OnePlus saying coustomer with get gift box who purchase in before 31st , received OnePlus waiting for  one week , no information from OnePlus and Amazon about it. Amazon saying we are not mentioned it in our site contact OnePlus, tried to contact OnePlus but no response from OnePlus it connecting thought mail and live chat. What is the next step ?

  The camera quality is not expected from one plus. This quality can be achieved in a 10k budget phone. Never expected this from One plus. You won't survive in Indian market if you do like that in nord using cheap hardwares. Many people were excited about one plus but this one is not upto the one plus standard so please don't buy.

  I got this toy yesterday after placing pre order on 28th july.I was expecting more powerful battery life and camera quality. Not up to the mark but okay its okay to manage in a mid range gadgetOverall happy after the 1 day usage. Finger print scanner response very smoothly and provide fast unlocking experience of the device. Warp charginng is excellent. Mobile is very handy having a rich display with 90 Hertz refresh rate.Go for it if you only want to spend 30k on some mobile phone.

  I recently bought this phone after going thru the great praises from all the paid media.  The very first shot from the so raved camera setup bursted the bubble. (I am Apple fan and will be Apple period and there is no turning back this was my last attempt). The Quality of image is so much doctored that it actual makes everything look so plastic. Tried GCAM too but that too not upto the mark of what iphone SE of first generation delivers. It just  mediocre camera and output is HORRIBLE.Felt so damn cheated.To be honest even the Redmi phone used by one of my known gives better results with their two lense camera. If anyone is planning to buy this one please don't go for it , there are many better options at cheaper price. and if u can shell out few bucks more go for IPHONE SE trust me u will not regret it.

  Nice phone camera also good and oxgen os and display is the main usp of this phone. Pubg gameplay is good but it supports smooth ultra fps that's the only con but in ultra graphics u got 95% of time (40 fps) lock which is good. And OnePlus said that they are talking with the tencent for extreme graphics. Hopefully waiting.Nice phone overall. Thanks

  I had ordered a OnePlus Nord from Amazon on 6th of August. It was delivered on 8th of August. After using it for a week the display was distorted. I took it to the service center and I was told that this is a manufacturing defect and will be replaced in 10 days. I  submitted my device to the service center on 17th of August. Meanwhile when I tried to track the replacement, I tried to reach out to OnePlus Customer Support via email, chat service and call. I was unable to get any response regarding replacement after 15 emails, 10 calls and 10 interactions with the chat service to escalate the issue to a higher authority in the company. On September 3rd (after 17 days) I received replacement but I was not given any acknowledgment for the replacement. It turned out that the replacement was also defective with display issues. Now they are not even responding to me regarding replacement of 2nd defect device. One of the worst customer support services on this planet Earth. Buyers beware and proceed with caution. I will never buy a OnePlus device ever again till I exist.

  ChoppyChoppy choppySuch a bad choice if u r a GamerDon't but this plz go for Redmi Note 8. ProI bought it for Performance and getting a Better phone for gaming but I'm very dissatisfiedEven the 90Hz Hz display is choppyNo option for Extreme graphic rendering whatsoever even in Smooth settings in PubgDon't go for this 700 line chipset i.e. 765gPlz buy the phone with 855 or above processor if u don't want to be disheartened like meI don't know what to do now after thisEven the Connectivity issue I encountered was adding to this pile of complaintsWhat good will 5g support will achieve when it's not even there for the next few yearsOnly the Screen Amoled display nd The Camera is worth the MoneyDon't buy GamersNooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooEven the touch doesn't work sometimes, u'll be shooting but the AKM stops after few bullets- this being the Major Turn-down üòí

  I have got severe display issue with green tint on 75% of left screen and the brightness is abnormall high on the left side. No matter how good the phone is in other features but it's being a mid range premium phone, at least this issue not expected.I have ordered 2 phones in which 1 phone is completely alright (no display issue) and other has severe. I tried to exchange the product but Amazon is not supporting for the same.EDIT : Thanks to Amazon for processing the return with refund. (Replacement could not be processed as the product is unavailable)

  I was very exciting to buy this mobile. But later realized that it's not worth the money.Pros:*Oxygen OS*90hz refreshing display*Smooth operationCons:Poor battery backupUnexpected poor cameraLess color variantsBottomline: Expected much better product especially camera and battery but it lags both. Realme X2 pro is better option than this.Updated:It's a total waste off money, pls don't buy it, lot of issues are there in mobile.Calls are not hearing properly most of the time.Battery backup is very very poorCamera is totally awful, it's like 10000rs mobile, not worth for 30K.

  #Camera Quality is not up to the mark when compared to  previous OnePlus previous models and generates lots of noise.#Bugs were there when I did start to record video using the front camera with a resolution of 4K@60 fps and it got resolved once I updated to the latest OS version.#Green & Purple tint issue is clearly visible when you operate the phone in dark mode below 30% brightness.#People who prefer 6GB + 64 GB variant must keep in mind that OnePlus Nord does not have an expandable memory slot. So the best option would be 8GB or 12 variant.#Please use a good mobile case as the frame is made up of plastic, which has high chances of getting damaged and it is not waterproof and dust proof certified.#Gamers should not consider this phone as the battery drains out quickly and there is also heating issue.

  Im a one plus user for past few years and this is the worst product iv seen.. the pros of this is its vibrant colour and price..Cons. Had problem with fingerprint sensor, its not water proof. As after 15 days of use moisture started forming inside both the camera lens.So i tried to aproach one plus customer care for conrinuous 3 days and it was so hectic stil they cudnt connect me to any customer executive of theirs. Then i aproached the customer care of one plus near me.. i.e. in mapusa goa. They said tht one plis is not providing them any support so they have shut down al the services temporarily.This is the first time i faced so much issues with the phone and one plus services..The only option left now is to throw this phone into garbage.. and go for some other phone .Totaly disapointed.

  Returning window of this product is closed on 30-Aug and same day I started receiving problem in keyboard.Keyboard of Nord is crashing and I reached out to One Plus support team as well, ticket is open now n yet to be solved.But it is very disappointing to receive problem in newly bought product.After a bit research I found keyboard problem is occured in many of earlier One Plus mobiles. Battery is also draining within a day. 100% charged battery doesn't last for 2 days even.Recommend all the upcoming buyers to check their mobile as early as they can; specially the keyboard thing; within the returnable timeframe.My experience started with a sad note :(

  It's best product...OnePlus is a brand and...Nord is a new direction...camera quality is better but not as good as 8...and battery life is quite good and it's charges 40 min 0 to 100....it gaves the best performance....and here is 90hrtz refresh rate then it's best but...if u used 60htz refresh rate phone then u will see definitely the difference... Face unlock is so fast but fingerprint scanner is not so good...and AMOLED display is the best... U must need to but this product....and now new direction comes in my life I m happy to get it..üòãüòã

  I am writing this review after 1 day of use. First of all the battery charging is really mind blowing and can charge the full battery between 65-75 minutes.Camera quality is good and good stabilization providing a premium feel in videography.Low light photography is the place we need to improve I believe.Sometimes I think this phone is overpriced but the Oxygen OS experience will remove that thinking from our mind.

  Tint issue.The dnd slider is malfunctioning.

  The moment you unbox this device you will feel this is a high tier device. one cannot easily find out that its made of plastic with gorilla glass 5 protection. The device is sleek and looks premium. i do like the slight gradient on its back. The camera bump is quite pronounced and definitely requires a casing which can prevent from smudges and other issues.it runs on android 10 out of the box  as expected for any modern android device currently available.the experience is smooth without any stuttering. 765G does performs well.coming to the displayDisplay is neutral and not overly saturated as compared to the OnePlus 6 that I have. But i must say the display is extremely well optimized for true to life colors. my OnePlus 6 kills the details when i run HDR videos which is not the case here. you will see the details and the texture well preserved in the nord as compared to op6. 90hz is becoming the new norm for  even in an entry level android and thats something which adds up to the smooth ui of the device.since i do have a k20 as well handy, the display of this device is no less vibrant and is vivid.another important criteria for me is camera. Its well balanced camera. the main camera borrows the same camera sensor i.e. the imx586 from OnePlus 8 which inturn has been used in the previous years OnePlus 7 series .  the colors are punchy, gets you through most situations without hassle. i do not use the macro sensor which is an utterly useless 2. megapixel camera. wide angle does its job well and thats an 8 MP. You do get depth sensor for portraits. Portraits are good if not the best . the night mode is improved as well compared to previous OnePlus. the selfies are a tad softer and i feel it can be little sharper. these companies force the skin smoothing on us. but some of us do not like this and would like to disable. Probably there could be an option which am yet to explore.  the wide angle in front camera is a nice addition for group selfies.coming to the audio is good. the loudspeaker sounds decent. its not a dual speaker on this front but a bottom firing single speaker which does it's job. the most painful part of today's devices which is almost like a plague is removal of the 3.5 mm jack. i dont know whats the real difficulty in adding a tiny little port. my OnePlus 6 has a 3.5 mm jack ans yet it maintains a slimmer profile than the nord.  its an annoying experience to carry around type c to 3.5mm adapters and not that u have too many good choices for a type c earphones. not all of like those bluetooth earphones which are quite a trend these daysso i do not have much to say about gaming.am not a gamer hence i cannot comment on this. but most likely the phone will be able to handle games like  pubg , asphalt 9 without hickups as seen on other tech reviews. moreover G model processors are wel optimized for games with higher clock speed set.thats pretty much that i use on a phone.i had options like Redmi K20 pro and also Realme X50 superzoom. K20 pro is definitely a device to consider if you are ok with an year old device. but u do get a flagship grade processor which is a powerful option as compared to 765G. but u lose out on 5G if u really care, for which we are not ready yet. u do get risinf camera which could be a concern in long run. but the non pro k20 with us is still doing fine. and few do not like the miui.but miui does have its own perks. I do like the option of lockscreen wallpapers which change frequently from the mi library and the content is rich.the k20 camera can be better optimized is what i feel.Realme x50 super zoom on other side is also a well packaged device however i wanted to go for a device with a Amoled since i do a lot of media consumption on my device where as the x50 had an LCD and one cannot get deep blacks and contrast on an LCD.most importantly i have been a longtime user of ghe oxygen OS. in simple words it's the no non sense UI and just as good as the Google's Vanilla Android UI. its blazing fast, updates get rolled out as soon as google releases.at last i had to chose a blend of everything for the money that i pay and nord was the device that fullfilled this. So in Nord you have 6Gb+128GB variant 25k which is coming in September, 8+128GB at 28k  and 12+256GB at 30k. at 2k increase i was getting a 4GB additional RAM and double the storage which made sense to choose this over other two variants.so who is this device for? i think its for some one who wants a flagship grade camera, a good punchy display for media consumption and social media,  but do not really wish to spend 40k plus but still get a flagship experience with few compromises in processor which is not a flagship but can still get you a snappy performance at a much lower price. you are also future proofed with this device ready for 5G.

  Got the device after a month of launch. Nord is not as per expectations. Battery life is horrible. I need to charge my device twice a day. No doubt it gets only hour to charge but battery back up is 8-9 hour is hudge disappointing. Camera is not as per OnePlus know for. It is average like mid budget 15-20k device has. Micro camera is just to add numbers. Night mode is also not so great. It has Google dialpad. You can't auto record calls and even if you does after it keep alerting during call: you're call has been recorded.Only good thing is no ads. Oxygen OS.I'll never suggest to invest this much amount for average phone just because of brand name.

  Mobile overall ok, but I'm really disappointed with OnePlus cheep publishing stunts for both budget tv and phone, that's the reason for one star review. Camara is flicking when we take vedios of fire/ smoke, I took videos/pics on house warming all of them I took while yagnam were flicking and blure, OnePlus connect is not so usefull with the OnePlus TV, keyboard not opening, when we play vedio audio and video are nonsync. Front cam also not soo good, I like the fingrt print point and switch. They could have give option to the user for wired headset, cz in wfh times talking calls hours and hours, don't think soo wireless ones will serve purpose.

  This is all what you expect from a 2020 smartphone! Everything seems really perfect!The cellphone feels more premium that what we actually pay for it!The user interface is really smart and snappy and it feels really nice while using the cellphone.This is my second oneplus device and I am really happy with it!The camera is really impressive...don't go with the negative YouTube reviews... It is really a flagship camera and you would love every single shot captured through it. The HDR is perfect and the edge detection is really impressive. And trust me the night mode is really ultra amazing!The only problem is that I just expected the battery to be bit more long lasting...it is not that bad but it's not that good either..but it gets charged quickly so it's not a big deal for me as well...but on a regular usage I think the battery performance is not that good and that's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I could really say that you can choose oneplus nord over oneplus 8 or 8 pro because there's not much of a difference in both of them. Personally I've compared oneplus 8 and 8 pro in real life with my nord and I still think nord is worth every penny and you could skip on 8 or 8 pro and go for the OnePlus Nord anytime!

  This phone is perfect for someone who uses it for casual use like facebook WhatsApp and some games and other apps and nothing intensive and with some pictures here and there..Built wise: 8/10Camera: 7/10Speakers 7/10Display 9/10 (mine had no tint issue)Battery 6/10 could be optimised with updateSo if you are not a very heavy user than just go for it..phone feels very good in hand with a perfect weight balance... although pubg runs fine with smooth ultra but I played only 1 TDM XD.

  Display tint issue is there. Display turns pink and green on low brightness in dark mode.

  For fingerprint sensor it has a great job, and battery life could have been better (lets wait until the next update) but the major i got dissapointed is its front camera. Though it has sony 32MP camera it takes a picture like 8MP camera or 12MP camera i didnt like it that much, though i am not a camera user still for 32MP sony camera it could have done miraculous job i guess. And coming to back(rear) camera i felt its good but still for sony 48MP camera it can do much better job, I hope that in the future updates they may change all the camera performance(both rear and front). Lastly the smoothness, I loved it, the way they have made it is incredible and its very handy too, but one thing that is lagging is the price is too hectic for mid range but still I loved it. Except for cameras and battery life, you can buy it eye closed....

  It's nearly been a month with Nord and on my opinion there's been no issues both the fingerprint and face unlock are fast the phone is so smooth even at 60Hz refresh rate and has a really good battery life. Excellent and smooth gaming performances till now screen recording is great and coming to the oxygen os its super user friendly you'll never need an external application or software to feel satisfied cause Oxygen os is one of the best in the market , camera performance is awesome the primary sensor gives much detailed and saturated images then wide angle lens both in front and back camera is the incredible the major blow would be it's macro sensor in my opinion cause the colours are much softer so if you just want to take best pictures you better buy a basic dslr but in overall performance the camera is pretty great, the phone is so slippery without a case so better use it and fast charging really saves you a lot of time, the alert slider is so usefull in short if you are looking for a smartphone in a mid range budget with cool user experience Nord is the best in my opinion but if you expect a high performance machine and ready to make some sacrifices like oxygen os,alert slider etc you have a lot of other options so choose wisely ü§ûüíï

  Hi I'm using 12/256gn variant since 1 month+. Don't waste your money!Cons:1. Bluetooth issue even after few updates.2. Getting location icon in status-bar even after location is turned off. It's a serious issue. every time I need to restart my phone to fix this issue.3. Phone gets heat if u use it while charging.4. After using the phone for few days (may be within 15 days) you will fell the lag in screen sensitivity (even if we run it in 90hz) 5. Call connectivity issue if u r using internet calling option. even though if your network is full and internet speed is in mbps your call quality will be worst.6. Battery discharges easily.7. Few gestures are not working properly after update. (might be because of software issue)8. In 4 rear camera last 2 are utterly waste even after updates.9. Finger-print reader is good but sometimes it lags to open.Conclusion:If you are thinking that you struggled a lot to earn money and if you know the importance and value money then don't go for it. If not its left to you (if you think you got money from somewhere and somehow without any effort and if you feel 30k is just nothing)I'm feeling about myself that i would have use this money to buy some other phone might be samsung A71 or apple's iPhone SE 2020.

  I bought the OnePlus phone first time and I bought12gb 256gb varient of this phone..I like every things on this smartphone like 5g ready, camera, oxygen os, performance is mediocore.The Software of this device is best in the game. I like it because it has the functionality like stock Android and also highly customisable. You can get software updates very quickly and fastly. It's 90hz screen makes the experience more smooth and snappy.I actually love photography so it is a very good phone to me. It's camera have OIS supported , you can get very good daytime shots with it. And may be mediocore night time shots But not as the level of flagship but this doesn't bother me because with the power of Lightroom I can bring those photos to the another level.The two things I didn't like that it's battery life it could be little bit better and also. It's display have some little tint issue.But that's not a big problem for me.Below are the attached sample shots from this device.

  This is a normal daily driver from oneplus. Not so good, not so bad.Pros:- Good design, feels premium even though the body is plastic- Good performance, no lag observed- Good call quality and music quality on headphones (compared to my oneplus 3)- Good signal reception and wifi speed.- Does not feel too heavy in hand and does not feel slippery with the case provided.- Smooth UICons: - Camera, this is is biggest negative of this mobile. I am not sure if it is the hardware or software, but it is bad. I feel my oneplus 3 produced better pictures with main camera. I do not see good colour reproduction, pictures appear little dull and low light picture is grainy. My family member's oneplus 6T is much better compred to nord's main camera. There is a huge huge difference in picture quality between 6T and this. I don't know what oneplus have done here. Selfie camera is also not good, oneplus 6T produces much better images. So if you are a photo freak, this is a big NO for you. Hope oneplus fixes it through software update. I am not much into photography with mobile, so I am fine here even though little disappointed.- Screen is not up to the mark. AMOLED with 90Hz disaply, really? Again I can compare it with oneplus 6T, and it looks better when playing games, videos or photos.- Battery drains faster without actually doing anythingOverall I do not feel this meets the standard set by oneplus, they have cut corners heavily, mainly camera and screen. This is just good enough as a daily driver, nothing great. I have gone for oneplus mainly for its support for good range of LTE frequency bands which can be used in countries like USA, compared to others in same price range. You will have better options for the price if your main concern is camera and you do not travel much to foreign countries.Update: After recent software update, camera is better and battery is not draining as before. Looks like it is improving. Giving 4 star.

  From opening up the box to setting it up and using it, OnePlus Nord provided a delightful experience, be it in terms of the fluidity or performance. As expected from OnePlus, it was a breeze to update the OS, apps and the UX was top notch. Warp charge 30T worked as advertised, topping up the phone pretty quickly. The camera performance was decent although OnePlus should have skipped on the gimmic of numbers and gone with just two good ones at the back. In my limited testing for two days, battery life was above average, netting me 7 hours of screen on time with location and auto brightness on, using only social networking apps and light games. This is bound to get better as the phone learns your usage habits and accomodates accordingly. The most unfortunate part was quality control for the display, a pink tint that covered about 25% of the right side of Nord's display under 50% brightness. It was terrible and noticable even inside a well lit room, provided the screen was under 50% brightness. This forced me to return this otherwise lovely phone as it was a deal-breaker. I'd still like to place orders in future to try my luck in what seems like a display lottery as the phone experience is rather well balanced. It's a recommended purchase provided you get one with a good display, otherwise return it.

  The phone got delivered today, it was quite a long wait as it was a preorder. I bought this phone for my father and playing around with it I guess this would be the best option for him. He's an enthusiast photographer, enjoys video and movies on youtube, a lot of multitasking and calls going through the day.The phone feels light in hand, not something bulky, though the structure is plastic but holding it in your hand or looking at it trust me you won't get the plastic feel. The fingerprint scanner is too quick and responsive.Charging was quite fast(26% to 100% in 45 minutes), the display is superb, clear and hell smooth (thanks to 90hz), speakers are loud too produces a crisp and soothing sound (please dont expect the performance of high-end speaker)The camera is good, captures a good amount of details in both 43MP and 12MP mode. The colours feel natural, autofocus was nice too as per the price tag but definitely not what they advertise it as one plus 8 camera. The camera needs more tweaks. Macro and depth sensor is ok nothing great or to be proud of.NOTE: Heavy Gamers this is not for you if you are looking something for long term.Thanks to one plus for this but yes gotta go you guys did overhyped the promotion, a good strategy must say.

  Product is good but not upto that typical OnePlus mark.....feels more lyk oppo vivo one

  Well what do you know, after much anticipation, I finally received my oneplus nord. thanks to amazon for striving to deliver even during these trying times.without much further ado lets get down to the nitty-gritty as am not much into writing reviews.First of all gave only three stars as it is kinda hit and miss.> Battery is ok with average usage but heavy users will be disappointed... wrap charge does a wonderful job as described and charges the device really fast.>Camera is so so .... 48 mp takes good shots but that's about it as the rest is average at best ..macro is the worst.>Finger print scanner and face unlock works just fine.>Had no issues with display. videos are crisp... youtube and netflix videos especially hdr contents are a joy to watch.> wifi and internet connectivity is good especiall with dual connect.>Microphone quality is ok and cell reception is also good.Thats the ok part ... now comes some of the bad part> As in the headlines there are some serious issues with bluetooth connectivity, All bluetooth devices you name it... fit bit, audio etc etc  gets disconneted frequently as well as sometimes it is a pain to pair sometimes not pairing at all, have tried the bluetooth devices in other phones and laptop and they work just fine.. why am I making this a big thing...... because one plus did not include a headphone jack period and i love listening to music!!!! i dont know whether this is a software or hardware issue ... have installed the latest updates so will have to wait for the next update to know whether it will get corrected or not.>The speakers on the phone are mediocrewill update after using it for a month or so (hopefully my impression of the device will change... keeping fingers crossed)Now you choose whether to buy or not as there are other good phones out there.>overall performance is good (not excellent)Update:Bluetooth issues solved with updates, amazed at OnePlus frequent updates, camera performing much better now, have been using the phone for about a month now.4 stars

"
"

  All rumours like green tint , display issue at low light condition , battery backup is less , takes more time to charge were absolutely WRONG.OnePlus lovers can go for it without any second thought.Tested almost 10days to give exact review...Display is good., 90Hz refresh rate is awesome, no tint issue at all brighness levels, loudness of speaker is good (no stereo), charges less than an hour(warp charging), good battery backup almost a day (without gaming) .Only issue I faced is with OnePlus z series bluetooth headset gets disconnected in between calls and audio playback. Hope this will also resolve soon.

"
"

  The phone was hyped so much that I decided not to wait and pre-book the device but to my utter dismay the day I received the device I noticed that the screen on dim brightness started flickering a bit upon which I raised the issue with Amazon, I thought that it was just some minor issue which the influencers were talking about and might get rectified with a software update. The update did happened but the issue still remained but it didn't stop there, to add insult to injury the phone automatically got formatted and all my data got lost! I literally rued my decision of ordering the phone in a hurry.

"
"

  An awesome phone for the price. Simply great. The camera is not that bad as described by others and in review videos. If you are planning to buy a phone with a budget of upto 30k go for it. No other brand gives you a 12|256 variant for this price. The phone is awesome. You wont feel the difference between a flagship processor and this one while using.

"
"

  The front camera is pathetic, blurness in photos like ordinary low quality pictures, its not worth giving 28k for blur photos which is basic need of everyone. For front camera photos whether its day light or low light its too bad, sad to see oneplus degrading its brand image by creating such a hype on this phone and manufacturing such poor quality. i think oneplus forget to test the camera before launching it, or they just want to bluff the customer by name......... u can get more good camera phone in this rangeRear camera is good, macro is pathetic its like vga camera, in day light condition rear camera is good but in low light poor quality, you can go for other phones in this price range for better experience in photos.Battery drains too quicklySoftware is good

"

  This phone is good but few things disappointed me. Please see the following matrix given below:1. Build quality: 4.5/5 ( it does not have the metal frame)2. Display: 4/5 ( compared with samsung j6 AMOLED display, it is not up to the mark, i liked the Samsung's display because of color reproduction and quality)3. Battery: 4/54. Operating System: 5/55. Camera: 2.5/5 ( eventhough it has 48 MP with Quad Cam setup, pictures are not detailed, it a average camera even after the software update; specially 2MP macro lens sucks; video quality is very nice; camera app user experience is not exciting.6. Processor: 4/5 (because its futuristic 5G)

"

  Firstly One plus has make the customer fool during the OnePlus Nord Ar launch of amount ‚Çπ99 to all who Purchased their launch event card. About phone it is the most hyped phone which doesn't meet my expectations. Lack of 3.5 mm headphone jack.No Dedicated micro-sd card slot.The 2 MP and 5 MP cameras are useless. Overall build quality is good. Oxygen Os (Great Android Experience and future updates).Decent front and Rear cameras.The In-display fingerprint scanner.Fast Processor and Above Average Display.The battery is decent and supports fast charging.

"
"

  When the phone was delivered it‚Äôs sound looks good.But after a days it‚Äôs speaker volume automatically goes low .And day by day it‚Äôs going low and low.Even on handsfree mode on full volume I have to take it to close to my ear to hear it.I want to replace it but amazon not allowing for replacement.I am totally frustrated after buy this phone.

  Its been one month approx of purchasing this device in which OnePlus has given 5 updates so here is my review after one month usage and on latest update1) the mobile is full of bugs, it looks like oneplus team didn't tested it before launching . A lot of bugs like camera crashing, photos not showing in gallery ,overheating after only 25min streaming,night mode error . already shared logs with the OnePlus team no fix as of now even after 5 updates still the same problems2)  on an average only 5 hours of screen on time, doesn't look like 4000mah battery have to charge twice during a day ,my older redmi Mobile was giving better SOT than this3)  network drops issue most often chrome shows blank page have to reload 3-4 times to show the page content4) the oxygen os is good smooth as silk5) camera performance is average6) amoled display surely surpasses lcd ,great colors diversification Conclusion- being new member to OnePlus community i expected premium services didn't expect such a buggy deviceUpdate- its been more than 2months of using it the problem has worsened the mobile heats like a heating rod even on a normal browsing for 10-15 minutes . Myb earlier mi mobile was better than it i do not have words to describe all the issue i am facing . Already shared the logs with oneplus team still no response . I will say only one thing if the return window wasnt. Closed i might have returned it . Its just a waste of money even a ki ,realme mobile at this price segment will be a great choice

  NO TINT ISSUEI TURNED ONT HE PHONE THEY GAVE ME AN UPDATE...SO typically your phone brightness level0 - 100 levelthey palyed it smart .. they removed 0--50 levelsSo technically when u slide to the left end on the brightness tab to reduce ur brightness thinking it would go to 0.. well it's actually 50th level portraying as 0 .. My First costly Smart phone.Well.. For average person I mostly invest under 15k for a smart phone..

  I have used it for about a week and I will have to tell that it's the Best allround smartphone under 30k. You are getting future ready with a 5g smartphone and Brand Recognition of One plus.Pros1) Oxygen OS2) 90Hz Amoled screen3) Smooth performance4) Good Battery Life5) Fast ChargingThere are not many cons according to me. The only one I which i noticed is that Rear camera quality isn't that great compared to Oneplus 8 like they are claiming. But they are good in Ample lighting conditions. Only when it comes to Indoor and low light they struggle a bit.Verdict- Go for it. It's a perfectely well balanced phone covering every aspects. The beauty of OXYGEN OS and Brand Recognition of ONE PLUS are something that you can't ignore.

  Very worst phone don't buy.Iam facing network connection issues.while talking it is going into hold n recording starts automatically . whatsapp call not at all responding very very worst phone after few updates iam facing these problems ...one month after iam giving my feedback don't buy this phone waste of money ..

  Let's start with the display of the phone one plus display is the better example in mid ranges phones range and camera is just as awesome as any other one plus phone and talk about gaming with the Nord was a good experience, though don‚Äôt mistake it for a gaming phone. Some 2D and lower-end 3D titles can easily hit the 90fps mark. You‚Äôd be happy playing 8 Ball Pool or Clash Royale on the Nord. However, heavier games such as Real Racing 3 and Fortnite do show some performance issues. Firstly, stutters are more frequent in high-action moments, such as gunfights in Fortnite. Secondly, frame rate drops occurred more often in games that rely on CPU-intensive features and if we talk about Battery of one plus so battery backup is never an issue with one plus because it comes with warp charger which takes your battery from 0 to 65 in just 30 minutes and lastly its price  I bought this awesome piece at 27999 from my icici amazon card by which I get 5% cashback... So if you want to buy one plus and your budget is lower than 30k then just go for it

  * Packing - Soft (Amazon)* Price - 25999 (AE Discount)* Touch - very smooth* Camera - front not good very disappointed by OnePlusBack - need improvement like filters and autofocus* Have some bugs* Purchase advise - Think again

  ¬†Within 7 days of use of the phone, the screen has started flickering. There is no return or support option available on amazon for this product. Would not suggest anyone to buy this phone, spending 27 odd k's on a phone only to use a phone with faulty hardware.Had a chat with the amazon team. Refused to help.

"

  when you go and come back to low network area, phone loses its connection with the network and never recovers, need to restart the phone. This is a major problem, lot of my friends/relatives started complaining that am not reachable for the whole day. Oneplus, you need to work on this.Redmi note 8 pro was far better than this.

"
"

  First of all I'm writing this review after 3-4 days of use. 1.The display is indeed a bliss to look at. You may not notice it at first. But you'll see other phones in slow motion when you use other phones.2.The warp charging is amazing. Gets your phone filled in under an hour.3.The primary camera is nice and captures details but it lacks the natural colour reproduction at times and the dynamic range needs to be better.(the camera of the redmi k20 pro is slightly better in terms of the color reproduction) and iphone xr camera still is better4.The macro camera is bullshit and need updates right away.5. Wide angle lens is okay, just okay.needs betterment. And could be better.6.The selfie camera is fine but no iphone camera , the wide angle selfie isn't that nice7.the build quality is firm,nice and of nice built but stands a tad bit lower from the redmi k20 pro ,maybe because of the metal frame vs plastic in Nord.8.Fingerprint reader and face recognition is damn fast.9. The battery lasts for a day under moderate use. Not more than a day for sure.10.Oxygen OS ! Wow . Just smooth, fast and a bliss !

  I had used my oneplus nord for 3hoursPros1.regarding display display was really cool with 90refresh rate and smooth2. Oxygen os is love3.I didn't find any greentits issues in my oneplus nors4.battery i was charged to 100% within 35mins where inital charges was 51% fast charging5.Audio clarity really good and no lagging and no network issues foundCons1.avg of camera quality and nightspace and bad not perfect2.this mobile is not for gaming they are really better choice rather than thisOverallIf your are daily user without gaming it is good

"
"

  Display/Touch is really good.Battery Life is also good for normal users like me, who use 3-4 hrs screen time in a day.. I am easily able to draw 40-42 hrs with a full charge.Camera is good..though it can be improved.Real quick charging.Fingerprint reader is fast, with lots of customization.You will see lot of new features when you switch from an android phone like - App drawer, hidden apps, wifi+ mobile data mode etc..

  I have been us this phone for a week now and here is my review.The build quality is quite good but I don‚Äôt like the plastic frame but feels durable enough.Look wise the phone is gorgeous and eye catchy I loved its look and in-hand feel.The rear camera is quite nice for the wide angle camera struggles in low light and the selfie camera is only good in well lighted conditions and is useless at night or even little dark. I am not satisfied with selfie cam in low light.The performance is average in heavy games but you won‚Äôt notice any problems in day to day tasks.The display is the best part about this phone the colours are punchy and gets plenty bright. The 90hz refresh rate with the180hz touch response is amazing and very smooth. The single speaker is loud but not as good as dual speakers. You will enjoy multimedia experience on this phone and the haptics are good too but feel a bit weak while typing. The battery is average too it lasted me a day with 7hrs of usage (without heavy games) but it gets covered up with the fast charging of 30 watts it only took 40 mins from 20% to 100.Overall I loved this phone but the selfie camera and macro camera needS improvements

  Speed: 10/10Screen: 11/10Battery: 9/10User Interface: 11/10 (OxygenOS is the BEST)Front Camera: In perfect lighting, it would be 10/10. In low lighting it would be 9/10.Back Camera: In perfect lighting it would be 11/10 and in low lighting, it would still be 11/10. It's truly awesome. The Night Mode works like magic!Speakers: Mono, but really loud. They have SW optimizations that add the stereo effect in earphones.Build Quality: 9.5/10Don't compare a 30k phone with flagship phones. But, I haved used my friends OnePlus 8 Pro and my Nord together. I didn't notice any difference at all. The 90Hz AMOLED Display does the magic (so smooth). Only when playing PubG in the highest settings, the 8Pro outperformed. Otherwise, there is no noticeable issue. Also, when it comes to the camera, yes the 2MP sensors are crap. The main sensors cover up for those 2MP sensors. Trust me. OnePlus tweaks the software from time to time. After using, you won't feel like it's a 2MP sensor, the macro images come so good with the main sensors. But again, don't compare the Nord with flagship phones. Still, you would hardly find anything to complain about. It would literally need a lot of struggle to find flaws in it. It's everything you could ask for, at a pretty great price.

  The phone has severe network issues and loses network very frequently. Call drops and Network unavailable most of the time. This is not an operator issue as I'm at home only in lockdown and get proper signal in other phones in the house.Secondly, even if you manage to get network, the phone has a very bad heating problem. Within 5-10 minutes of voice call the phone heats up badly and becomes unusable. You have to wait for it to cool before being able to use again.Lastly, the battery drain is too bad. Morning 8am at 100% gets to single digit by 5pm with average usage. If I try to watch videos/game then it goes down faster, but you don't have to worry about it as within 15 minutes of watching video/gaming the phone will heat up and give you a notification that some functions have been disabled to reduce temperature. So you don't worry about watching video or gaming for long.Overall too many bugs which are not resolved. Wouldn't recommend to anyone..

  what happened to oneplus. It used to be role model for quality in phones right from start with oneplus x. now we no longer can trust specs on paper.selfie camera is one of the worst ever. blurry pixelated images. 3 yrs old phone models in this range have better camera. even making calls have issues with this phone. there are bugs everywhere.very poor quality in ever aspect. total waste of money. they have to understand, they cant please everyone. End of the quality matters and there should be value for money spent and specs needs to be up to the industry standard. just saying 32 MP is not enough, if it performs equivalent to 5MP.this is my last oneplus and never again will trust this brand with my money.

"
"

  Just ok mobile there are lot more defects but manageable for normal users my suggestion to go with other brand's in this price# Black bar in night mode at top if display# Screen tint issue pucca# No Battery backup# Worst cam no use of back 2 cameras# No full screen mode for applications# No 3.5 Jack# Out of the box RAM 4gb/8gb# Sound us loud but no clear# Original accessories are so costly# More baground cached data# Sometimes lagging..Overall my rating is 4/10 please check all YouTube pros and cons before you buy don't buy in hurry like me.

"

  Premium looking phone with a clean and smooth UI. With regular and faster updates by OP, it's certainly the best phone in this price range.

  Finger print reader is too slow and asking me to keep my fingers for more time than other phones.. battery life I have no idea.. I haven‚Äôt started using it fully,. Camer quality.. sorry there is no quality at all.. too much of beautification In the front camera and back camera too.. I can‚Äôt even make a video call using this because I don‚Äôt look like me in the front camera.. am really really disappointed.. am using iPhone 7+ should have gone for iphone 11.. I did a big mistake.. since it‚Äôs not refundable I have to live with the regret üíî until I upgrade next.. thanks n bye

"
"

  It's not for the first time that one plus had made any undoubtedly price worthy smart phones I was using one plus 6 since last 2 years and was thinking to upgrade it so finally made my decision to buy so finally made my hunt for new phone initially when I searched for reviews about one plus Nord people have very mixed reviews which made my purchase difficult I thought wether I should go or not but finally made my mind and bought this and I am really happy and it's totally vfm.

  After using 3 years the battery of my  moto x4 is suddenly stopped working after an ota update .... battery replacement was not possible during lockdown ....at the same time one plus announced to release a midrange smartphone like zlite ....one plus brand has great customer satisfaction regarding oxygen os optimization on hardware  ..so I decided to purchase oneplus nord (later declared) with preorder benefits ....blindly purchase Rs 499 ... enjoyed AR launched event ..got my preorder box1  tshirt and stickers...booked nord @Rs 26k using amex card ..my pre-order is being delayed ..again oneplus announced that they will provide one year extra warrenty to those whose pre-order shiioed after 4aug ..mine shipped on 10 aug ... delivered on 11 aug ....also they also provide my box 2 @Rs4780 and provide one year extra warrenty as they promised.. so at last faith on oneplus regarding products offers is totally worthy...in this way effective price of my nord is 19620 [28k - 2k (amex offer) - 4780( gift box) -1599( one year extended warranty)].Right now I have updated my nord to 10.5.5 ..I didn't face any problem just one google discover issue which may be issue with Google dearch to higher refresh rate display ...No Bluetooth issueNo battery backup issue (since I am not a gamer)Fabulous display with 90hzFast 30 watt charger765G  ...5G readyBut have slightly tint screen issue (using dark theme and very low brightness)Camera is overhyped...may be optimised after ota update...Battery backup not at the best..

  Read this review before buying OnePlus Nord!!!Review after using the phone for 9 days!Pro's:-1. Oxygen Os best os after 'ios'!2. Display is good! (Fluid Amoled 90hz)3. The speaker is loud and clear!4. Alert slider comes in handy!5. The phone is really good to hold!6. Warp charger!7. Future proof with '5g'8. Updates9. The camera quality is good both front and back after the update!10. Battery life is good for non-gamers!11. Fingerprint sensor and face unlock works really well!!Con's:-1. Amazon's delivery got the phone delivered after 2 weeks!2. No headphone jack,but understandable given that tws is the future!!3. Tint issue though not a major problem but can be seen in dark conditions!The phone is good, but I would advise you to wait for Realme x7 pro and Poco's nord killer, compare them with Nord before you take your decision!!Have a good day!!!üòÑ

  Camera quality of Oneplus Nord is Good for Daylight and Night. Battery life is also quite good and charging speed is so fast!But i think that it‚Äôs a good option to consider on Budget with Stock Android (Bloatware Free OS) and finally it‚Äôs 5G Phone so we can use it for future (Jio 5G)For more information about camera review watch My Video on iProTechHub.

  OnePlus nord is definitely overhyped to the next level , but the price is good and it is not the best OnePlus device nowhere near oneplus8 camera is the weakest point the third camera for the Bokeh mode is not even used when you hide the third camera and click on portrait mode of the picture quality is still the same , if you have no problem with camera go for it , or increase your budget and go for oneplus8, overall it's  a decent phone

  I had been a critic of one plus and it's users so far, but now realised why one plus users are so mad about their phones...till now I had used motorola, Sony and Samsung phones....never experienced the smoothness and speed like one plus....battery back up is absolutely good using it from 100% (8 pm to 9 am ) and had done all installing process, video and movie watching, still have 40% left.... absolutely stylish mobile, the blue colour  is damn attractive....I am not a gamer so have no idea in that side.... everybody had lot of praising for os....have to experience it and feel the smoothness....the only down side in this mobile is the large cut out for front camera, too big and one camera would be more than enough, it had also reduced the beauty of the phone....I had switched from Samsung A51 ( used it for less than 15 days), compared to Samsung the camera is far ahead....no colour tinting issue(worried a lot about it after ordering)....one more thing if u r using the case coming with the mobile be ready for a very bad smell from the case...my conclusion is blindly go for it, you will never regret....value for money....

  Great battery life- I have consistently been getting a full day‚Äôs use on a single charge, even 36hrs on one occasion where I used it sparingly. And the battery charges 15% to 100% in under an hour.Display- Very good resolution, the high refresh rate helps tooSmooth app handling and multitasking- even in my 8GB ram variantAudio - very nice driver range and playback quality (sounds perfectly good on good headphones and earphones)

"
"

  # when I start using the phone I was really shockedand amazed by the touch screen smoothness and speed, it's really too good# One plus nord battery life is superb , I had to go for once charging in a day if I am using the phone continuously watching/gaming etc rather than Mi note 8 which had to go for charging twice.# Camera quality at night is also superb# finger print reader somewhat lagging in sensing , sometime it is unable to read / too fast removal of fingers etc

"

  After one day usage, I can say this is a very good mid range phone.Pros: smooth OS, Amoled screen quality is very good, no screen tint issues.No bloatware apps like other Chinese phones.Selfie camera is goodGood build quality.Face unlock is very fast.There are 6-10 tips and tricks available in Oxygen OS which is very useful in daily usage.Cons:Rear camera does decent job, not meeting the expectation set by OnePlus.Battery drains fast whenever refresh rate is set to 90Hz.On screen fingerprint scanner is not quick compared to rear scanner.Headphone jack is not a problem for me, I am using bluetooth earbuds. Also there are type c to 3.5mm converter available in the market in 200rupees.This Mobile is  very good choice for daily normal usage. Not recommended for heavy usage.

  I had the OnePlus 3T before I went for the Nord. I had bought the 3T for 35k and bought this 12gb variant for 30k and I have to say, it's a HUGE upgrade for me.People in the reviews keep on commenting about how the camera isn't good, while comparing it to phones outsidebita price range. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I have to say, the cameras are excellent! The only phone that may be slightly better in the camera division maybe the Samsung A51 of a similar price range. But then again, the rest of the hardware in the A51 is pretty much garbage.The battery is excellent, touch response is excellent, gaming performance is good, not the best, but good enough (not for high perfomance gaming). I play COD on it on medium graphics and works very very smoothly. The display is just magnificent.If you are looking for a phone within 30k, your search stops here.

"
"

  I have been using this phone since 1 week now. And below are my findings.Pros:1. Oxygen OS experience. Its fluid and smooth. I already got 2 updates in one week.2. Excellent display.2. Camera. OIS and nightscape mode is too good. The depth and macro camera is of no use.3. Main selfie camera is good.4. Body design is good. Phone feels premium and easy to hold.5. Fast charging. It charges the phone from 0 to 100 in around 50 mins.6. Gaming is smooth without any lag. I played pubg, 8 ball pool and bully-anniversary edition.Cons: I thing the battery life is average. Maybe the 90hz screen is draining it quickly. I am getting 1 day of backup with moderate usage.All in all, I think this is a good purchase. There maybe other brands that are offering better on paper specs in this price but remember the main usp of this device is the experience of using oxygen operating system.

  I got the 12/256 version for 28k because of amex card. Best in this price I would say.Using this phone for more than 10 days now.Almost everything about this phone is best in this price.Processor: Works really well for day to day usage and any of the modern games. It won't lag or anything with 12gb ram.Display: you won't be disappointed at all. The best in this price. Nice amoled display, nice color and everything and 90Hz on top is like the best thing. Super smooth display.Camera: main rear camera is really good captures really good picture and low light photos r also good. Macro cam I don't think is that good, gets the job done. You can additionally use Gcam also if u want.But I Didn't like the selfie camera in low light, idk what the problem is but I guess with update they will fix it. Hopefully.Battery: Nice battery backup I would say. Gives about 7 hours of screen on time with moderate usage (including little gaming).And about charging speed, 0-100% in 55 minutes if you switch off and charge. And if it's on then it takes about 70 min to charge fully.Look and feel: Really looks good, I have the grey color which really suits. Premium glass back feels really light and premium.Speaker- no dual speaker or dolby atmos, but believe me the sound is really loud and clear. Actually better than other dual speaker phones.Cons- No 3.5mm audio jack and plastic frame.Conclusion- If u don't need the audio jack then I think this is the best buy in this price. You get brand value and oxygen OS with soo many other pros. Go with it without a second thought.Happy shopping üòä

  Camera quality is very disappointing...even Samsung's below 20k models will take good photos. Don't get trapped by their hypes & Gimmicks...!!! Pls do watch Geekayranjith's Detailed review video before you order it. Worst thing is depth camera is fake,it's useless. If u want to own OnePlus go for other good models,don't go for NORD...!!! Instead buying it for 30k..u can prefer other brands with better overall performance under 20-25k.

  Recived on 8th August. High rated mobile for this specs. Facing High heating  issue even when used normal and fast battery drainage even when the mobile is in standby mode. Complained customer care care yesterday they asked to factory reset and set up mobile as new again and try. Which was done now. But still I could face the issue.Need to contact them today.Is anyone else facing this issue? Whether issue is sorted out? If yes kindly provide your suggestions plz.

  The phone is good and definitely feels premium and in day to day life performance is as smooth as butter and camera is good, though can be improved with system updates and the warp charge is consistent and charges the phone from 0 to 100% in over an hour (depending on the voltage you receive ). Overall a pretty sweet phone with good built quality (It does not matter much that the frame is plastic afterall you are going to protect it with a case at the end of the day).Only thing that is lacking is the camera (a little bit) but that can be improved with updates.Otherwise I am satisfied with my purchase and it is a phone which is overall a very good device with good haptic feedback , topnotch indisplay fingerprint sensor etc. Talking about the tint issue , this can be solved with software update and hope that OnePlus would look into this issue and resolve it as soon as possible with a software update.

"
"

  This is one of the best phones from OnePlus buf with some fixable flaws. I'm using a 12GB RAM variant and not at all happy with the oxygen os's ram management. Even though my phone has 12gigs, it cannot keep more than 5 apps running in background and no app running in background after 15-20min, so just forget about heavy games which is not expected from OnePlus and that too from a 12gigs variant. I know keeping apps running in RAM could  drain the battery but let the users decide it :)Another thing is camera. Seriously macro lense sucks and is waste of space, waste of money, waste of time. Camera app needs a software update. Output images are not as great and consistent as from OnePlus 8 even though OnePlus's is claiming same module. Well mentioned issues can get solved in future updates. Display is awesome, but even my handset has that greenish shade issues when seeing  at screen in very dark room which isn't a big deal. If you're switching from a 800 series chip then you'll definitely see the performance difference but 90Hz covers it smartly. Everyone is saying battery is great but I didn't get more than 5hours of sot that too without gaming. Final call is yours, cheers!P.s. you can not uninstall the pre-installed Netflix app.

"
"

  Timely delivered. Overall satisfied with performance but camera is not upto the mark not a camera phone at all.

"
"

  Display quality is not as good, coming from the oneplus5, the amoled of Oneplus5 is far better. Color is not same and saturation is also not good. I think it's really cheap display.I didn't notice any green tint issue.

"
"

  Though it has a screen issue in low brightness but overall good device.In low light if the screen brightness is set in low then there is a black bar through the camera cutout and also has slightly greenish tint.But in regular usage it doesn't make any effect.Overall good battery in regular usage and performance is also good enough.Thanks to oxygen .....is for smooth experience.NB. Cameras need more optimization and solve the screen issue. Though it has 90 hz refresh rate but some times it lags. Need to fix this minor problems.

"
"

  There is no issue in display.Bottom speaker work well no issue.Performance awesomeSide plastic ring is looking like cheap material.Pre applied screen protector  , also back cover.Only missing in box usb type c heandfree otherwise put 3.5 mm jackAverage front camera

  Too many bugs in the software. Even making a basic phone call or receiving a phone call is nit error free! The basic utility of the phone itself has gone missing.The screen issue is existing, it's not noticeable in daily use. Only if you look for it you'll find it. Nevertheless, shouldn't be existing to an extent where normal usage is hindered by it. By far the worst iteration of phone by oneplus. Maybe the x was close to this in being bad.6 cameras, but not even one can produce decent results. They saybits the same module as OP8 but why is the result so bad from the main sensor? Looks like, they are wantedly degarding the performance to sell OP8 as well?90hz is present, but not certainly sure if it helps! As battery drains and have noticed couple if times, the phone phone hearts up! (After a week if usage, given that initial battery cycles might lead to extra heart dissipation) The peak brightness of my 5t is higher than Nord!All in all, look somewhere else. Not the right time to buy, maybe few issues might be fixed with OTA software updates. But there many hardware issues on this like the screen, battery and maybe the calling network issues!So, for time being stay away! Will update the review in future is OTA updates solve them!

"
"

  Surely the hype was worth it and so was the wait!!Pros- Display, Performance, In-display fingerprint, Premium feelCons- Mono speaker, Not so effective macro cameraBut ignore the cons and just get the device as no other mobile can compete with 12/256GB model in this range.

"
"

  Positive:1. Good display and touch (Pink tint issue is there but it will not hamper your experience)2. Decent sound on both speaker and earphones3. Main camera (48MP) is good4. Brilliant RAM management, No lag observed in normal usage5. Satisfactory battery life and fast charging works perfectly6. No heating issue observed during normal usage and fast charging7. Finger print and face unlock works perfectly8. Wifi and Bluetooth connectivity is good enough and the call quality is also pretty much standard9. Blue colour is really good and weight distribution is great. In hand feeling is good.10. The clean and add free UI of the oxigen OS will make it way different from other android phone of this budget11. Back cover is really good. No complain on the pre-applied screen guard12. Haptic feedback motor is just OkayNegative:1. Below standard camera performance at low-light, selfie camera is not that sharp or good. Slow image processing noticed. Software optimization required. OnePlus could provide a telephoto lense instead of giving those bad depth and macro lenses2. 90hz display is not as smooth as I expected. Software optimization is required3. Auto brightness could have been work more smoothly, Jarking noticed when the brightness is getting increase or decrease. Again the software optimization required.4. 3.5 mm jack is not there. At least the type C converter must be included in the box5. Sometime noticed the screen gets tapped when the fingers are extremely close to the screen.Verdict:1. Good for a reliable daily driver but probably the gaming experience will not be immersive2. 5G has no use. The device could be configured with SD 730G chipset since the performance is pretty much similar to the 730G based devices. Price could be reduced atleast upto 5K by Using the 730G processor3. Balanced device. This device has no extraordinary feature and has nothing extemely bad4. 12GB variant is the best value for money option5. Over hyped and little over priced. Only go for it if you like OnePlus and it's clean UI

  Oneplus Nord... I have been using this phone since 10 August 2020 and now it's a 15 days of usage review.This phone got a lot of hypes and I think it's all worth it... If someone planning to go from 15k phone user to under 30k segment this phone is a great one for you.1. So coming to the design aspect this phone is gorgeous, don't confuse yourself by the plastic frame and all use a bumper case.2. Battery life.. Is kind of decent and I won't say it's a great one I have been playing heavy games recently and I get roughly about 30 percent remaining battery life at the end of the day... So it's pretty decent.3. Camera, here it's the main feature where you can take great photos at the outer lighting conditions and in indoor it also take some pretty good photos not bad.. The macro camera the only disappointing factor other than that this one is great for taking good shots. And the front camera is great and the wide angle lens makes the best use from it. Video quality is great in both the front and back camera thanks to the optical image stabilization.4. Performance... The snapdragon 765G doing a decent job as it shows no lag in the loading of apps don't worry about the PUBG high graphic settings it really works great super smooth in its at most usable higher setting. If you are a heavy gamer then you should go for other Snapdragon processor which gives high graphic importance in the play.5. Display... The 6.44 inch super Amoled display looks good and yes in the outdoor just make sure you increase the brightness before you go out or else you can't what's in the screen. Since it's 6.44 pill shape punch hole design the phone doesn't look soo big and it's handy to use. Even in the 60 htz display it works soo smooth thanks to the Oxygen OS and in 90 htz it's even more smoother for browsing and scrolling news feeds in social media but it takes 2% of charge higher than usual.6. Fast charging... From 20 to 100 percent it takes around 1 hour to charge and its good job for its battery capacity.7. No headphone jack... It's the major disappointment in this phone but yeah you can use a type c to 3.5 audio jack dongle which cost you extra.And finally from the attached picture you can see in my phone there is ""no green tint"" issue in the oneplus nord, maybe some units got that issue and I hope they have replaced them... Overall Nord is a good phone from oneplus don't think about other negative points people tell if you are planning to buy just go for it. My 4 star for this phone is just because of the delivery delay for my pre booking and the worst packing... It got so many damages in my box. Thanks hope you guys find this review useful.

  Pathetic product from oneplus , and more to add in bad experience  there pathetic customer supportBrought it and within a week it shows *Qualcomm crashdump mode*Customer supports answers after 20,30 mins and asks for problem and then put on hold for another 30 minsNo where to report issue and ask for helpInstead I would have bought 9k mobile ,that works at least for year with decent  customer  service

  Beware !!Oneplus nord has serious network issues.Dual VOLTE is not always working. I am not able to recieve calls. I tried with Jio sim on both slots. Even tried using idea sim on one slot with 2g network. Tried different combinations; changing primary and secondary sim's. Ultimately found that there is a serious network bug in the software (or hardware?) and to solve this temporarily, i am now switching on/off airplane mode every now an then. Annoying!!! I've notified this in the oneplus community forum. For more information regarding this issue, search ""Oneplus nord network issues"" in google.

  Lovely phone..people who are talking about bad camera quality.. must be shooting in auto mode.. the pro mode if handled properly works like a breeze n the picture quality is also fantastic. n one always insatl GCAM to improve camera performance. yes the macro cam is useless. n i think with few updates the auto mode will also work fine. the display is vibrant.. its smpoth with 90hrz refresh rate. the only thing that is bothering me is the in box back cover.. as i use gesture to navigate the phone the edge of the cover is too pronounced.. hence not been able to navigate smoothly. waiting for other cool back cover options to hit the market.

  Good mobile but not the best..oly primay 48MP lens performs well others are just a gimmick.Selfie cam is doing the job perfectly..SD 765G is Good Enough for daily usage and again 5G is also a Marketing Stunt ..After a week usage nothing special in this mobile except oxygen os ..so u can buy this mobile only for Os and 2yrs update support nothing more can expected .Pros1.Awesome Display with 90hz smooth refresh rate2.30W warp charger is a beast,charges the battery in just 50 mins3.Primary camera  lens is good.4.oxygen os is superb to use.Major cons1.macro lens and Depth not upto mark2.single speaker just loud,not crisp it could have been atleast stereo setup3.Nightscape is good but need lot of optimization via future updates4.765G with UFS 2.1 is working fast but not lighting speed like 8 series processors just good for daily use.5.4115 Mah is ok but makes to charge twice in 24 hr usage .if u r  not a pro user just a single charge is  enough.

"
"

  Overall I'm happy with the way this phone performs. Lets point its features out:- Great display fells extremely smooth thanks to its 90 hz refresh rate, colors are punchy on the phone and a bit on the contrasty.. side by default but you can change it to your liking anyway.- Performance is great 765G is more than enough for a lite user and by this I don't mean it won't perform if you want to play a few games on it. Works beautifully.- Now the only issue I came across while using this phone was its camera, even though it's being advertised for its bomb camera setup it's really not that special. The camera struggles quite a bit under low light or even a well lit indoor shot. This said I am pretty sure this will improve over time as this phone has the hardware to get those beautiful shots so its just a matter of time before OnePlus comes up with a few updates and fixes all these issue (well at least I hope they do!!!).So to summarize overall this phone is great and will satisfy your needs and expectations just dont think the same for its camera that's just poor :'|

  The amoled display is pretty bright and amazingNice body, feels pretty premiumOxygen OS is clean and snappyRear main Camera is greatUltra wide is okishThough the macro one is not that goodBothI think it is value for money üí∞Go for it üòÉ

  Pathetic Camera, feels like shooting by 5MP camera wayback in 2005.Main camera is atleast useful, rest is just to increase the no of sensors, so that more money should be charged from consumer.Just like OP included WARP charger in box similarly I think, OP fitted WARP discharger in the phone.that's why NORD drains battery like no other phone must be draining. I am not a heavy user or gamer but I need to charge 2 times in a day to keep mobile powered on round the clock. Don't know how and why, people in review says that battery backup is good whereas it is pathetic. Just because OP is providing fast charger, it does not mean that user should always seat next to power supply socket all the time.Above said is my Frank opinion.

"

  there was a tint on screen along camera module which is visible in low brightness, technician admitted that it was a manufacturing defect but amazon refused to give me a replacement, oneplus customer care suggested me to visit service center for a newly purchased device that is worth 30k. if these things happen in budget phones, it's okay but it's a premium midrange smartphone and that too from a reputed brand. checked oneplus forums and saw lots of users are facing same issue, in my suggestion. don't buy this product because amazon is not going to help you with this product after sale. even oneplus is not going to help you with this, the statement i recieved was that is a characterstic of OLED display, while me being using amoled screens from last 4 years, knows that it's not a characterstic feature but a manufacturing defect. not the brand which stands for quality anymore.

  I bought oneplus Nord last week which was delivered on 14th Aug 2020.  Phone worked well for 1 days and it stopped working on Saturday night.  I found phone is turning off and on within 30 secs on Sunday morning and if it turns on and stays for a min then there would be no network.  It would neither connect to home wifi nor mobile network.  It hangs and turn offs immediately.  I contacted Amazon for resolution and i was told to wait till Wednesday.  A technician will come on Wednesday to check whether phone is working is fine or not.  Nothing can be done before that and there is no option to send tech early.  I have no other phone till and there is no guarantee when would i get refund or replacement of this product.Very pathetic service and will not recommend to Anyone.

  Overall: 1. Solid phone. great camera2. Buy if you want 5G and have budget for 25-30k. Else you can go for realme/oppo at 10k lower cost.3. Much much better OS than xiomi/redmi. No bloatware. even oneplus app come default disabled!4. I loved the cameras even though online people have said camera is not so good. But again it's hit and miss. Some of the night pics (or those with light in background) i took seemed over-processed and/or pixelated. In such cases change the settings5. Sturidiness is good. But still buy with insurance. Screens once gone never come back!---5G: This is really something I don't think i'll need. i'm happy with 4G for all my needs. This shifting of spectrum is a total money making business. The shift from 3G-4G was necessary, but put unnecessary pressure on telecom players who had invested lakhs of crores on 3G spectrum for 20-30 year leases. That time reliance was the only early one to buy 4G spectrum at deep discounts (probably knowing before-hand about regime change). Again, I think 5G is a scam to help reliance make money (and 4G spectrum buyers like airtel lose money). I dont see myself needing 5G anytime in near future.Safety: I've broken my oppo 3 months back. Used an older Redmi. Which broke in one fall in 2 months. Used a broken phone for 2 months so this was important to me. This comes with plastic guard and screenguard inbuilt. Plastic guard is larger at corners.Weight: It seems sturdy enough. But lots of online reviews say the phone if mishandled can breakBatteries: Great fast charging! I charge once a day and charge for 30 minutes or so. even a five minute charge lasts for 2-3 hours (of video calling)Speed: I'm not a gamer or anything, but seems fast enough easily for all my needs.Close to Stock Android: I used to go for xiaomi and realme which completely spoil the android experience with their own versions. Might I say the xiaomi version was pure evil. It used to hoist a much of MI apps on me. If i uninstall MI Pay, the next morning, it used to come back, on it's own! Oxygen is such a relief after these. The OS -Muhc Much better than Xiaomi. Marginally better than Oppo and Realme.Build: I liked the build. It comes with its own cover. The cover has extra protection at the corners and has special seal for battery area so water doesn't get in.Camera: Comes with lots of cameras. How do these help? They give  the software a chance to build a composite image, capture more light in a shorter interval and get depth perception easier.Close up camera: I have captured a baby butterfly/moth which was smaller than a fingernail. This was at full zoom. Though i was only holding with hand, there is no blurriness on image. Details have come out adequately. Supposedly i could have done a macro but the camera interface doesn't easily open up all the features. For example I had to fiddle around before i could figure out how to switch on the flash.Nightvision Camera: 3 exhibits for your viewing pleassure. I have done a comparison between the actual photos in the night, and the modified photos as captured by the cameras. As you can see, the captures have completely improved the lighting. I have not captured using tripod for long exposure etc and yet shakiness is not too high. The starkest effect is in the selfie captured where it seems like day! the colors in the modified image are true to actuals. This was very surprising to me!Selfies: Good camera as gets nice depth. Use with google photos to ensure you never run out of space for photos!Color: Blue is my favorite color, and I love the pastel blue of this phone.

  the camera quality is really very poor it adds the beauty effect automatically on everything and you will look like someone who is wearing  lot of makeup. I am so frustrated because now I cant even return this phone. I am not going to buy anything from amazon again. worst buying experience amazon.I hope this comment costs you a lot of loss because you deserve it amazon.thank youregardsbye bye amazon

"
"

  It is better to say it is very good deal right now(i bought when it was launched). It is very balanced phone, not a beast in any specific area. It must it is a phone which most of users want. Moreover, OxygenOs is icing on a cake.You are paying more price because of oxygen os. It will get some price cut.Cameras are above average. Main Camera (primary camera) is pretty good and ultra wide also captures good shots but due it is 8MP lens so details will get lost if you zoomed.Battery is one day. Although, you get 30T warp charger which charges a device 70% in 30 mins.No lags no heating issues no bloatware in software.Yeah, processor has less powerful as compared to 800 series processor but it easily done tasks as 845 do.

"
"

  One Plus has come up with a great product in correct pricing. This is what is required.The cameras are superb and at par with phones costlier than thisFast chargingIt is 5G ready. Means when 5G will come to India this feature will be enabled through OTA. Only one Sim will be 5G . Other will be 4G. Remember it is like older phones when 4G was avaiable in only one sim in dual phones.One Plus Nord is a good buy

"
"

  It is not a flagship if you want that experience. It is a really good midrange experience coming from one of the better brands. You can certainly get more value for money from other brands however the quality of software support and customer service from OnePlus is better than all such brands. A must buy especially if you love oxygen os or just want a reliable device to use for 2-3 years .

"
"

  It's the perfect mid ranger. It's snappy and smooth with 90 hz, display is good albiet a tad low on brightness. Will test with 60z on and update later on. The best thing about the Nord is the OxygenOS. Got an update to version 10.5.5 immediately on starting the phone. The phone is a bit tall and I would have liked a bit more width like Samsung M30s which was was previous phone before this. The warp charge works as promised ... got to 0%-100% in 107 mins after the phone was installed with almost 100 apps, which I thing I was consuming some battery in the background. Haven't tasted camera much except couple of selfies which  turned out perfectly okay in night light, and daylight photography returned decent pictures. About sound quality - music volume is pretty loud for a mono speaker and can get distorted on full volume. Call volume is good but not very load. Phone speaker volume is a bit on low side which I disliked. Marble blue colour shines on day light and night which looks awesome. The phone case provided with the box is good one. Start guide is a joke and not much given in it except placement of various buttons. Will update more since it's been only a day of usage for me.

  ‚ÄåOnePlus had always come across as a company that delivered on its promises to customers. But sadly, the Nord marks their deviation from this customer-centric philosophy. They have stooped to the level of mediocre companies making empty claims about their products! Nord is utterly disappointing, its cameras (claimed to be on par with OP 8 series) is worse than ones found in below 15k phones ,  monospeaker gives tough competition to those in cheapest phones ,  display has pink tinting issue, battery drains in no time, all in all it points to use of substandard hardware all round which makes this phone not worth even 15k!!  OnePlus also seems to have bought out all the top reviewers so that they can effectively mislead prospective buyers.

"
"

  Worth the hype.Good phone in this budget segment.Bought the 12gb ram 256 gb on pre order and am satisfied with the performace. Camera takes good photos in natural light and with flash. Selfie camera is also good. Battery life is not that great . Does drain quite quiclky. The finishing looks premium with Corning gorilla glass on the front and the back. Heavy duty games work sufficiently well with a little heating.

"
"

  Worst battery life, it is not even withstanding a day thogh only used for minimal usage, never gone for gaming, video streaming still battery drains drastically, I need a replacement.Another big drawback is heating issue, heating for normal 3seconds call, I have never faced this issue in my earlier phones ...verybad experience with nord... Disappointed, lot of hypes in the phone, it is normal another phone with 5g technology(don't know about 5G compatibility only we know when started using 5G, they sold and earned profilt)Only camera quality is good..

"
"

  I have order nord on pre book day. I want to order blue marble 256Gb but it was not available on 28 July. So I compromise and order grey one. My friend order blue marble on 6 August on open sale day and recevied phone on 7 August. Even though I order phone on pre booking day (28july) I received on 8 august. Very disappointing from one plus as they delivered product to open sale customer rather than those customer who has booked phone on pre booking day. I want to get replace it with blue one. I trying to contact Amazon through call but they disable call us option for this product. One plus just created hype for Nord. They didn't provided customer service. There is also issue in bullet z connection.

"
"

  I guess today we are in a place where for a given price range, we always have 2-3 best phones.Choosing one phone depends upon the right side of trade off u want to go.Realme X3 SuperZoom, Vivo V19,Realme X2 Pro, Redmi K20 Pro, Oppo Reno 3 Pro.All phones have their own trade offs.One plus nord gives you average experience in every segment be it camera, cpu, memory, battery etc and Oxygen OS. I think oxygen OS and oneplus brand is what it strikes out.If you want to incline towards only camera or only battery or only CPU go for above phones.If you want a premium feel and average value for money exp go for NORD.

"
"

  It's above average for mid range phones.1) Battery life is good it's regular normal using stand by 14 hrs2) Gaming performance : It's average only and playing games some network connectivity issues happened3 ) Display is really nice / daily usage feel better4) Camera : Below average only software updates required .In night time it's quality is very low..

"
"

  I am using Jio as my primary network in my Oneplus Nord for a week. Most of the time there is a network problem. The sim shows full network but Net is not working properly. I have to turn on to airplane mode and then turn off to get the network again. Please solve this issue. I am getting this problem only in this phone

"
"

  One of the few disadvantages is that 3.5mm jack is missing (supports only bluetooth earphones) and also supports only and only nano sim...otherwise the price range and the features considered, it's a great phone to buy within that budget üëç

"
"

  THIS PHONE IS JUST AMAZING.ALL FEATURES IN ONE PHONE AT THIS PRICE NOTHING LESS THAN A FLAGSHIP PHONE .SURELY YOU CAN GO FOR IT , WITH CLOSED EYES

"
"

  Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.* Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.* 60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that.* The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.* The phone looks and feels premium while using.* Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)i suggest this nord for who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints..

"

  I am writing this review after a week of use . The phone has almost equal number of goods and bads to it . So here goes .Pros:1) Display is very good. And it is not curved. Thank god for that . Excellent colurs and 90hz refresh rate do help. Do not compare to those of the 60k+ flagships ofcourse.  I have observed some issues  with watching c HDR content. Other than that it is very good .2) Narrower and lighter compared to most other phones in this price range or above. Operating it is much easier because of it .3) Very good battery life. Easily last more than a day under heavy usage .4) 30T wrap charge is definitely a plus . Not many phones in this price range can boast of better charging speed than this , except for a few realme phones .5) Gorilla glass 5 protection on front and back. They are usingn the same glass for OnePlus 8 pro too .6) Main camera is good for the price. It is the same one used in OnePlus 8 and 7T/7pro. But the camera software needs some work.Which I am sure OnePlus will do.7) Selfie camera is good too . not sure why we need two Selfie cameras though.Cons:1) That horrendous pill shaped cutout for the selfie cameras are a real eyesore. That also eats into the display area a fair bit and affects the overall usability especially in case of using apps like Netflix.2) Plastic frame instead of a metallic one .3) There is some noticeable shift  in display white balance when it switches between 90 and 60hz, maybe only for my unit .4) Ultra wide and macro cameras are there just to make up the numbers. Especially the 2mp macro one is useless.5) Software still needs some work . I am sure OnePlus will keep updating it and make it better .6) It would have been better if OnePlus had made 3.5 mm jack available at this price range instead of going for the usb c only route .

  For 28k and some exchange I found this product value for money. For 30k I don't think so, reason being camera quality in low light conditions is poor. Marketing on the basis of 4 camera is being done by one Plus but it turns out that macro camera is not good at all.I would definitely say that picture quality in day light conditions is osm. Gaming experience is smooth with no heating issues. Better life n charging speed bith are phenomenon.

"
"

  Phone Is Great Deal with Premium feel and Touch.I bought original one plus cover and glass protection.Back cover gives premium feel .Amoled screen enhances overall experiences.Friends don't listen to youtubers .No tint issues no lags .Those who expect high end features in 30 k just grab the deal.Only issue faced with Amazon prime delivary .Amazon delivery agents threaten to cancel the delivary if i not collect it from its warehouse.Due to urgecy i had to collect it.I called the customer care but they could not able to fix the issue.I experienced third class delivary despite Amazon prime member.Delivary agents don't even protect the privacy of customers they ask for product information .

  Today i received oneplus nord . Its not feeling like oneplus phn . Recently i m using oneplus 8 5G .

  Phone is good looking and handy, feels like a premium phone, Camera is awesome and must buy phone under 30,000/-. More fully it doesn't feel more weight and feels really weightless one and warp charge also does its job quickly and when my phone is at 80%, while you charge it shows 8 to 9 minutes to get fully charged. Phone doesn't get heat while charging....including charge holder.

  AFTER USING 5 YEAR ZENFONE MAX 2GB/16GB  THIS PHONE LIKE FERRARI , 12GB 256GB EXCELLENT ONLY IT MUST HAVE SD CARD SLOT , DISPLAY TINT ISSUE IS THERE HOPE THIS CAN RESOLVE AFTER UPDATE , VOICE CALL QUALITY GRATE AND PAIRING BLUETOOTH DEVICE PROBLEM SOLVED AFTER  10.5.6.

  I purchase on 6th Aug 2020.I am totally dissatisfied with One Plus 5G NORD...One Plus give 3 updates in just one month...Why??Just Because Camera Quality is not Good...Sound Quality is not Good... Resolution is not Good... finger sensor is not good...One Plus should take back our Phones...as it have lots of manufacturing defects...So they give 3 updates in one month.Third Class Video Call...Network Problem...Don't waste your money in Nord.I request to One Plus please replace your manufacturing defect mobile.

"
"

  A well made product when it comes to build quality. The processor is fairly capable, no slouch at all.Coming from a OnePlus 3 as my previous phone and this feels like a major upgrade, no lags, no stutters and looks great too.The macro camera was sub par but has gotten better with updates,  the rest of the camera array is great.Speaker sounds decent.No network issues so far.Great battery life and charging speed is pretty good.When I'm buying a phone I usually look for being able to use all my apps without issues, a good video and photo camera and a reliable battery.This ticks all those boxes.In fact this has reduced my battery anxiety quite a bit as it lasts and allows for a fair bit of usage and a quick 15 to 20 minutes top-up allows you to keep going for quite a bit.The relative stability of Oxygen OS makes it a reliable daily driver.

"
"

  Everything is fine except that green pink violet tint issues and warm display issues auto brightness issues i got headache due to that issuesAnd when i approached Amazon they responded quickly but they're not able to provide a replacement so with a heavy heart proceeded with a refundBut now I'm in a confusion should i buy again or notBecause i want a mobile without any issues because we're spending 30k and we don't change mobile's so often so i need a mobile without any issuesIf you're okay with the issues you can buy it without any confusion and if you're lucky enough you'll get a mobile without any display or ant issues good luck with your new Nord

  This is my first OnePlus phone so I had my expectations in check. After using it for a while I feel indifferent towards the brand itself as there's absolutely nothing remarkable about this phone worth talking about which why I'll only be talking about the issues I have with this phone.Had poor charging speeds at first. After a few System updates, that fixed it for me even though there was nothing about battery in the change log.Camera is...well not a flagship by any means as they've tried it market it to their fans. If this is what passes for flagship these days, OnePlus is going to have a hard time ahead. Apparently, it's the same module as the OnePlus 8 but the functionality is limited and quality worse even. Although I personally think for a 30k phone, it's okay.I don't play games on my phone but after watching a movie for a few minutes the display does heat up a little. Nothing too serious yet but time will tell. Any heat issues will more or less cause the battery to degrade faster.There's a problem with my phone where sometimes after a fresh boot the phone will not show SIM signal for some reason even though it detects it just fine. Another reboot does fix it all the time but it's minor inconvenience/nuisance that shouldn't be happening.The UI is pretty clean. Don't have many complaints here except for the gaming software bloatware and the lack of a music app. Yes, yes I know there's many apps in the Playstore that gets the job done but that is true for literally most OnePlus apps yet it didn't stop them for making those. Coming from a Samsung phone, it's a problem for me because Samsung has their own music and video player that don't show ads or anything. It does have Google Play music app but I didn't like the orange UI with light background and other playstore apps don't integrate with the OnePlus lockscreen well.Updates: The sim problem seems to have resolved by itself. Battery life is terrible even at very low brightness but does charge quickly. The display is very reflective, i.e it's hard to see things outdoors because of it. Although, it's possible the pre applied screen protector is the cause.

  if you are looking for premium phone with below mention quality.1. Best UI ( Speed interaction with app and ad free2. Best camera quality - camera is same as oneplus 83. best AMOLED screen - awesome black and brightness, vivid color experience4. Best battery back up and charging speed- 1 hr full charge/ 30 min - 70%5. 90HZ smooth refresh rate - it actually cool if haven't experience6. great loud speaker quality - its feels premium and with little bass -7. compact size phone - not big and not small - perfect hand size for all daily use.8. support of good developers and quality team -from my side there is no CON in phone as my last phone was redmi note 4 ( we should create less e waste and Value our money )I miss headphone jack, however we should accept modern technology and use Bluetooth earphone as 3.5mm jack is way more old technology.i suggest spend on phone who last long with less ( zero ) problems so choose it wisely, instead of spending 20K- 23k on redmi, samsung or other, Oneplus really provide value for money.

"
"

  First of all, this device is hyped with hell lot of expectations. Amzed with the features offered, I Pre-ordered Oneplus nord and waited 9 days for the delivery. After switching on my device, I just have no words by seeing the yellowish tint on the display. This is even more worse using in night times with green and purple tints at low brightness levels. My oneplus 3T display looks much better compared to the Nord. The replacement is processed by Amazon as they verify issue by arranging technician visit to examine my device first. It's really a big disappointment..Thanks to Amazon for looking into my issue .. I suggest ppl to reconsider before buying.

"
"

  I m a OnePlus fan, still disappointed. The green and magenta tint on display is very real, whenever there is something grey on the screen which will be  a lot if you use dark mode, the display just goes crazy, showing all tints from green to pink.Secondly, there are some issues with Google Play services that doesn't load up a search or a page in one go but that might get fixed with ota.Cameras are a mixed bag, if you take selfies soo much, it sucks in indoor lighting conditions, very good in outdoors but not indoors.Rest of the phone is what you would expect, 90Hz display,you will forget after using it for a day and when u go back to 60hz it's not a discernable difference as every reviewer says so. You will see difference b/w 60 nd 120hz but not so much here.Buy this only if you are looking for a OnePlus phone, otherwise there's better out there.

"
"

  The main highlight is the software experience u get....it's just awesomeAnd i would say it's overall balanced phoneDecent picturesDescent audio from the monospeakerDescent haptic feedbackDecent premiumnessBut one issue : it has slight tint issue in the grey background (ignorable)I would say its worth it!!!!

"

  Awesome phone,great performance, no lag while gaming,I have tried pubg, cod, asphalt 9 all are running super smoth at high settings,charging is also super fast, No screen issue for me, Totaly satisfied with the phone. Don't listen to the youtubers they are all sold to other brands, trust me you will not get a better phone than this at 30k price.

  No problem with the Nord Performance, as usual it poses no problem in daily taks, also Oxygen OS is best out there but the most advertised feature ^Camera^ isn't that good. The front camera selfie in indoor shot is not clear , it's giving whitish on face , also the back camera 48MP is best but it has less features , the macro and depth camera doesn't give satah factory result. The camera isn't good in this one. Hjghl disappointed.maybe some update in future will help in this issue

  Just after using one day the phone os crashed... had to boot to the main menu using power n volume button.. i didn't update the system after installing new apps from play store .. system update - is that a reason to blame..If so - y can't it be made forceful...For a 30k phone the hand experience by improving the build quality s expected.. one plus 5 s more solid i feel

  I purchased this one plus nord 5g phone worth Rs 29999.00 through Amazon on 25 th august 2020.This is the  worst phone i have purchased in my life.This phone keeps restarting every now and then.Apps such as netflix and amazon prime doesnt work properly on this phone.You cant even install the system update oneplus nord oxygen OS 10.5.8.AC01 DA even after downloading  2594 MB of system update 5-6 times.It keeps on showing the same error system update installation failure.This phone has been given for repair at the One plus authorised service centre,Vytilla,kerala twice.The first time the service personnel told the issue has been solved in 30mins.After the first repair the time gap between restarting just increased and the other issues also persisted.The second time when this phone  was given or servicing it took 3 days as my phone had to be  ""kept on observation"" as this was a repeated  issue.But still these issues persists.You cant return this phone because as per Amazon's policy even if you buy a phone worth Rs 30K it has to be returned within 7 days.Please note no one expects a brand such a one plus to sell such a low quality product.The warranty card provided by one plus is absolutely useless as you can give your phone for servicing multiple times at the authorized service center multiple times free of cost in case of software issues.You can get a replacement only  if its a hardware issue.I had even purchased Acko 1 year total damage protection for worth Rs 1618.60 for my phone.But whats the use as this plan only covers physical damage and not software issue.Please do note that every time you have to give your phone for repair,you have to erase all the data in your phone, take a backup and put your SIM on some other phone.People put their hard earned money just because they trust that a premium brand such as One plus will never betray customers by making false promise.If this is the scenario,people should go or cheaper brands which value customers money and time and offer better services.Even one plus call center executives can only help customers to give their phone for repair at the authorized service center.,which i am not willing to do in this present situation.Please do provide a replacement for this phone.Looking forward for a new phone without any complaints.

  Review after 2 months of usage.48 MP camera performance is okay, while OIS is great for video recording.Other camera features are average.Google call app doesn't allow you to auto record call.Bluetooth connectivity is very poor with my honor band 5.Need to reconnect min. 10 times everyday.Gaming experience is same as samsung M30.There no meaning of talking Performance of processor SD765G 5G, because it will take min. 2 years for deployment of 5G networks. Overall 2.5/5.

  Have got a new one plus nord a week late.... And loudspeaker needs repair.It's sound is bursting.And I am struggling finding the one plus service center..Dint expect this in a new product . Highly disappointed.

"
"

  I really loved everything.. its UI.. features.. battery life is really good.. charging speed is also well.. other all aspects are pretty good.. speakers are not that bad.. enough for a phone but still it lacks.. camera is good.. but expections were much high..Accessories costs very much.. Overall good one but now comes to its issues..That display tint issue.. connectivity problems sometimes.. then idk why but charging is not that fast.. then game like ff isn't working properly idk still why.. camera optimization is poor..PLEASE THOSE WHO ALL HAVE THESE GREEN TINT ISSUE IN YOUR PHONES BETTER TO GET A REPLACEMENT OR RETURN.. BECAUSE IT'S A HARDWARE FAULT.. I've gone for a replacement n as stocks aren't there so I got the refund. Better do it unless you want a defect product..üôÇ

  First things first- it feels like a premium phone in a budget. You get what you paid for.Listing pros and cons here:Pros:1.The processor coupled with ample ram and storage is fast enough to carry your day to day tasks, no lags or hang issues2.the OS is smooth and clean(NO ADS). Dark mode is a great addition.3. Display is great, punchy and vibrant. It gives an edge over its competitors3. Sound is loud enough4. Very good call quality5. The first primary camera and second ultra wide camera wont disappoint you.Cons:1. Facing bluetooth connectivity and drop issues with wireless headphones. Two rounds of updates stating bluetooth fixes didnt fix it.2. Punch hole could have been a single one.

  Battery life poorFront camera not good

"
"

  Nord is most probably the best in this price segment and apart from Google Pixel, nothing would come anywhere near, camera is pretty good, my only problem is the Macro camera. It doesn't do any good and it's just an additional, main camera is pretty much does the same as the Macro does

"

  Ordered on 26th Sep afternoon and Amazon delivered by 8 PM.. Kudos to Amazon on that.. Ws deliberating between Samsung A71 and Oneplus Nord.. Finally went with Nord and I should say I made the right decision.. The phone is blazing fast and feels premium with that wonderful screen.. Though I would have liked a metal body instead of plastic, the phone will live in a case anyway so optics should not be a problem.. Long term durability is something to watch out for.. Camera is great and as everyone has rightly noted Macro camera is useless.. But not a deal breaker.. Reception is great.. Sound quality for a mono speaker is awesome.. Battery backup is good too.. Overall a phone you cannot go wrong.. Great stuff from Oneplus.. Highly recommended..

  Fingerprint Reader is very fast when comparing to other brands.Battery life is pretty draining. As I notised, It stays around for 1 day and 6 hours.Camera quality is awesome at day time.Apart from that, mobile is fast and display is marvelous.

"
"

  I am using this phone about a month.Facing problems like its gone in booting mode automatically and it takes 15-20 min to restart the phone again .Second thing is its charging speed gone slow .In first month its charging speed (0 to70% in 30min) is like as said by a company .But now it take 1h30min to full charge . I am very disappointed.Camera quality is goodBattery is also goodFace unlock is mind blowing very excellent 5/5 rating.Charging speed 2/5

  This might help someone and save their money.1. Don't decide to buy a phone on crapy paid YouTube reviews (think if they are given review unit, those will be absolutely well quality checked and enhanced ones, no company give crapy defective product to review and take down their own reputation) only who spent money and bought to review them they review that product genuinely.2. Don't fall for so called company logo or crappy watermarks on pictures they captured ( which seems cool as every owner thinks, which actually not), they aren't worth your money.3. Don't rush and take newly launched phones, always see user reviews and buy.4. BEWARE OF FANBOYS. yes, this is important. As many of my friends have this company product, they feel themselves as brand ambassadors, they think their mobile company is superior supreme.. just because they have spent more money for after all a Chinese product, now because crapy Chinese product. Don't listen to those Fanboys, after all they are not your pocket but you are going to spend for it. Choose what makes you happy, even 10k mobiles aren't bad. You decide your mobile product not those product advertising people in your friend group.Now I tell my review about the unit I got:Pros:1. Slim sleek design2. Good OS3. Wide diplay4. Charging speed, charged to 100% within 40 min5. Handy6. Haptic touch is very responsive7. Good back cover8. No lagsCons:1. Camera:Camera is not at all feels like OnePlus camera (as I used many OnePlus phone's pictures of my friends). Though it has same camera specs of 7t and 8,8 pro (main camera I am referring to) it doesn't click photos like them. I feel my iPhone SE (2016 model) takes better natural pictures than this. Poor low light pictures, grainy, and photos become filter applied at 2x at low light. Depth sensor won't detect edges properly. Marco is waste, main camera colours are over contrasted. Front camera takes beautified pics even we don't use any filters, not at all natural pics, my iPhone SE old model's 1.3 mp takes more natural skin tones than this camera, it's like oppo beautified camera, wide angle camera is good.2. Display:Pink tint issue was present. More visible in Google apps. There was black bar visible extending from front camera notch hole, which was so irritating. It was visible in dark room, in dark theme, brightness below 10 percent.In light theme I could see screen fluctuations even though auto brightness is off.90hz is just a gimmick, battery drains fast at 90hz. So when I changed it to 60hz to save some battery, it is so yuck, lags are more, works like 2gb ram android phone. Since I came from using my iPhone SE old model at 60hz which is way butter smooth even after using it for 3.5 years, this nord disappointed me.3. Build quality:I got unit which had minor dent at its right corner.4. OSGood. Found some bugs like revert of settings to default after theme is changed. So u need to change those every time u change the theme, so irritating.Final opinion:I returned this product, Amazon service was great. 28k is not worthy for average processor, bad camera, average os, average build quality, average infact bad display. If you buy this thinking camera is good , you are fooled. Instead take 7t or realme x2 pro or k20 pro or Samsung m51 or a51, they won't disappoint you. Think wisely, don't fall for false useless advertisement gimmicks.Hope this helps you. Thank you, have a great day.

  I was very happy at first buying an oneplus phone and was also very satisfied by it's performance but today it's just been around a week since I bought the phone and aside from the lacking of processor like I already knew settling for a lesser snapdragon processor would only provide little stability and max graphics of HD at games like PUBG, but today aside from the quality lacking in front camera like clearly phones like galaxy M31 provide a much better front camera I saw this status in battery and the phone got really heated up and the battery status showed that it needed 1 hour and 45 minutes to get fully charged I mean a warp charging phone how can it show signs like this within the first week itself. Really disappointed from oneplus on this one.

"
"

  Dislikes : I dint like the seller experience while placing the order. I placed the order on 25th Aug and item was supposed to get delivered on 30th Aug however the seller dint dispatch the order till Friday and then the delivery date got changed to 2nd Sep. Seller was unresponsive and dint respond to the email. Very bad service . Though i received the product on 2nd but i never expected this kind of overall service by Amazon.Likes: Phone is simply awesome. This is my second buy from One Plus (first one was one plus 3t). In simple words i really loved the phone.  The grey one looks really nice. Though the back panel is plastic made but they have made it look very nice. Good one.Well one thing which i dont like about the new one plus models is the wire jack . We need to use a connector . Rest all good. I guess the One Plus Lite model will have that wire jack feature.

"
"

  ¬†4.5stars from my side.The rear camera is good specially the 48mp mode . The only thing which is useless is the macro camera.The selfie shooter is good. Just a bit of distort in potrait mode .But i believe all the camera problems which people are feeling will be fixed by updates.Just like it was in the first realme phones.The gaming experience is good.Refresh rate and game mode helps alot.Tried both PUBG and ASPHALT 9The sound from the speakers are good.Charging was super quick.Battery ran for the day despite of high usage .The inscreen Fingerprint is a bit Slow but the faceunlock is superfast..Overall its a must buy for the person who dreamt of buying oneplus but cud not cz of the budget ..Also its a 5G enabled phone .I mean go for it guys..

"
"

  Camera is more disappointing.they said shakey free pics but it still blurs the pics.finger print sensor is very bad. Small range phones bettter than this.doesnt look like one plus . Snapdragon 765 processor not upto the mark. Slight lag while accessing photos or anything.If anyone wants to take should go for higher end than nord or go for other brands. No option to return this phone else happy to return. Speaker quality is worst.sound might be loud but not crisp.

"

  ¬†Very bad experience from Oneplus NordAfter 1 month of usage it is not working properly there is a stuttering problem and there is no service center in my city, they are not even providing pick-up and drop service to my pincode.Very disappointed with oneplus after sales service.

  Average product but price little bit high. I have been using this phone since 48hours and my view regarding the user experience and overall performance I mentioned below as pro and cons formatPro: 1. Clean and clear android OS and fully customisable3. Battery performance not so bad (5-6hours*) (4-5hours with 90Hz RR and game like COD/A9)4. Dark mode is awesome5. Processors works good with high end games like CoD/PUBG/A96. Premium feels without coverCons :1. Heating issue with high end game and apps like Unacademy2. Camera dept very worst. Only main cam works fine other 3cam just for show off3. If you switch from LCD screen to OLED you will feel pain in your eyes or sever dizziness Within 30mins of use4. YouTube Video available up to 1080. 4K video option not available5. Fingerprint And face unlock features , I Donot think it‚Äôs secure enough6. Plastic side body so use with care. I got screech within a hour of unboxing7. 90Hz RR consume more juice than 60hz8. Battery drain without use. Over night drain up to 10-15%9. Google application battery consumption data not showing in the usage data10. Fast charging issue within 12days of use. Now it‚Äôs need 45 mins to fully charged.More pro and cons will be updates soon......

  Received phone today! Thanks Amazon for the quick delivery!To all Nord buyers please consider this review seriously!!!Oneplus Nord made a lot of buzz but delivers nothing much great!Camera - 2/5 just average*Quality - 2/5 , the cost cutting is so visible!Display - 3/5 ,it's bright but not impressive...Gaming - 2/5 ,especially Pubg players please stay away from this! Performance is too poor and graphics settings are very low... Don't get fooled by  any YouTube videos!Color - 4.5/5 It's bold and colorfull..Fingerprint - 4/5 works really fast!Overall - 2.5/5 Expected more then wat received and the expectations were set by the OnePlus Ads..To all oneplus premium users or New buyers this phone is not for you, please go by the specs not by company's name! From my experience , OnePlus 5 and OnePlus 6T is way better then Nord! So I suggest you to go for OnePlus 7T/Realme X2 pro..I ll add/update after a month if changes found üëç

  I am giving feedback after use of 1 week. Over all phone is good, sometime it gets slow. I faced hanging issue at the very first day but then after that did not face such issue . Sometime I can't listen any voicemails or videos, it gets blanked then I have to restart device. It happened twice in a week and when it's brand new phone it's not acceptable. Only 48 MP cam is quite good, rest all are ok ok but not good..I don't know why this people have gave that 2 MP cam, instead of that they would have given 3.5 mm jack or something else.  Battery life is more than average, it's good to use. I only love one thing that is charger. I will edit review later if anything gets changes in performance.Facing bluetooth connectivity issue like alot. It's not acceptable.

  BEST FIRST 5G PHONE UNDER 30000 Rs/- MADE BY THE GREAT BRAND ""ONEPLUS"" (CAN BE TREATED AS A GREAT COMPETETOR WITH APPLE) !! IN MY VIEW ONEPLUS IS MORE THAN APPLE BRAND!!A FEEDBACK TO ""DARSHITA ELECTRONICS"":-  GREAT SELLER!! I WANT INVOICE OF NEAR BYT DATE OF THE DELIVERY THEN THEY GIVE ME AS I WANT!! REALLY I SALUTE TO DARSHITA ELECTRONICS!!‚úî‚úî‚ú®‚ú®üëâIT ALSO HAS A GREAT SECURITY FEATURE (WHICH IS NOT PRESENT ON EVEN SAMSUNG)!!‚ú®‚ú®üëåüëå‚úî‚úî‚úî‚úî

  Best valued phone which I got. 12 Gb Ram and 256 Gb storage at the best price. I have actually booked the phone on 27th July and received the phone 1 day before the launch. I was surprised on the Delivery Schedule of Amazon. Thanks Amazon for the early delivery.One Plus phones I always rely on for a longer term of about 2 to 3 years. Upgrading my One Plus 6 to Nord was an outstanding deal. Thanks One Plus for early dispatch.About the phone :1. It is 5G Ready, though we don‚Äôt have 5G Network in India. (It‚Äôs coming)2. The camera quality is outstanding.3. Voice output same as other One Plus models4. A little sleeker than other models.5. Finish on the edges is truly praising.6. Colour of the phone (Grey) is soothing.7. Transparent back bumper Cover along with the phone is of good quality.All in all, I love this phone so much I am planning to buy one more.

  Switching from iOS to Android wasn't an easy choice, but I had heard that if someone wants to move from apple to android then OnePlus should be the one, due to it's clean UI.I might be nitpicking but I have so many small-small issues with this one.1. Notification- the way notifications used to appear in Apple was way more simplified than it's here. It gives you so many options to manage your notification that everything suddenly looks so complicated.2. Max limit to notifications- This is one of the lesser known con about this phone. I use the Twitter app a lot. But this phone limits the maximum notification for a app to 22. If you're follwoing someone who regularly posts then you will end up missing many posts from that person.3. Call recording- The Biggest CON. While recording a call, it will play a voice message and alert the other party that call recording has started. This just fails the entire purpose of having this feature. Also there's no option to automatically record all the calls.4. Vol up down button- by default the volume up down buttom is set to media. So an extra step is added if you want to reduce the ringer volume.5. Battery- Battery is just average. Lasts one day on power saver mode. Without that it's tough to last it for a day. Although the fast charging feature is pretty good.6. Camera quality is good but deteriorates and becomes shaky on zoom. Though it performs well in low light conditions.7. Fingerprint scanner- although the accuracy is good and it picks up even if your thumb is a little wet, but it's just a notch slow. Again comparing it with my previous phone- iPhone 7

  Overall perfomance of the phone is amazing.best in class perfomance in this price range .It feels really nice in the hands.Best diplay for this price i'd say. Camera is definitely similar to oneplus 8,but its not the same although,nord is lacking some of the features of oneplus 8 camera.charging is pretty fast 0 to 100 in less than an hr. eventhough the battery is morethan 4000 mah the display and hardware comsumes a lot of power, so battery backup is not so great but above average.Operating system is lot smoother with less bugsOverall i my perspective,considering the brand value and the product value oneplus is giving,for sure it ll be really a money worth purchase.PROS*Supperb camera perfomance in this price range .*Pretty quick charging.*Nyz display in this price*Front camera wide angle is awesome.*bigger display and 90Hz refresh rate.*Smooth os with less bugs.CONS*Lacking the premium buit quality out of the box.Overall its a plastic body*The volume mute slider feels a bit low quality in the daily usage.*In display fingerprint scanner is not as faster as a sidemounted scanner.*Battery backup is not great as expected but considering the display size ,its ok with that.*Sometimes proximity censor goes crazy while calling and endup with making the call hold or muted probably.

  Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:‚Ä¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.‚Ä¢Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.‚Ä¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam.‚Ä¢Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)‚Ä¢Premium user-experience.‚Ä¢Face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.‚Ä¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.‚Ä¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here‚úåÔ∏è

  One plus Nord is a decent High-Mid range smartphone which gives promising performance and overall great value for money.Look & In-hand feel:Excellent look and build except the frame which is plastic. Corning gorilla glass 5 on both sides is good protection against physical scratches and damages. In hand weight balance is pretty good. Doesn't feel heavier.Build quality:With some compromises due to its price, it's still a robust device to own. A typical premium feel.UI & OS:Excellent job. No complaints here. Clean UI and bloatware free OS gives a seamless performance.Battery:Average 7 hours SoT with normal usage.So decent battery life. No heating issues. 30T warp charging does a great job. 50~55 min for 0 to 100.Camera:Good hardware for camera in place, but scope of improvement still exists.Pros:-Great 90Hz fluid amoled display-5G enabled-Clean UI-Decent Camera-Alert slider-30 watt fast chargingCons:-No expandable storage-No headphone jackVerdict:Go for it if you want decent overall performance as Q 765G won't offer the same performance as Q 855 or 855+ hence gamers need to rethink. Overall Great Device!

  Ignore all reviews on YouTube or any other channel and you will have a best phone in your hand and that is OnePlus Nord. I gone through reviews but still I took chance and now I am totally satisfied with my decision of buying Nord. Everything is best in class from built quality to cameras and performance. Super smooth performance without any lag and also no ads big relief. For headphone jack you can go for Bluetooth headphones or buy usb c type to 3.5 mm jack converter from local market,I got it for 120rs and believe me it is awesome sound with powerful base.(my headphones are of iphone). Phone speaker is very loud most of us use headphones so that is not a issue. Macro camera is not that good bt again that's not a big issue bcz rear camera click stunning pictures also nightscape mode gives superb results. Front camera is awesome. Battery backup a big thumbs up for it bcz I am normal user. Charges in time which is promised by company. Finally Never Settle for any other phone go for Nord.

  It's really great device and awesome daily driver. But it's seems like OnePlus really lacks in camera and display quality. Yes camera is bad if you someone who want better camera and take lot of pictures then this phone is not for you at all. About the display well display is good but yes it do have tint issue and it's noticable and also effecting using experience if your really serious about color and pictures as a artist or creative person well it might bother you some time specially in night or low brightness condition. So at the end it's good phone to buy and hopefully OnePlus may fix this issue vai update. Give it thought before you buy and also look for some other options. Other things like battery, figure print, charging works fine and no lag at all.

"
"

  I am really surprised and not sure that what's happening to the phone, not even 15 days and the phone is hanging frequently. Can I return this, not a good purchase for sure. Cannot trust on this phone anymore...I read all reviews and then made a purchase, phone looks good but when it comes to performance too bad!!

  *Being OnePlus user from oneplus3.. Expected lot from this mobile..  *Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles.OnePlus 5 series is the last premium mobile from op.  *one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced  *don't go on brand name and look.  *Now a days samsung is very strong with their midrange mobiles.  *1.Camera is literally bad, I mean really really bad  2. If you are a selfie lover please don't go with this  3. CPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships  4. Camera‚Äôs for depth and macro photos ‚Äì especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output  5.Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBG  6.Sound Quality is borrowed from cheap china mobile. Not expected from ONEPLUS  7.Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate  8.Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength*

  Honest review.3 Things I liked the most-1. DisplayIt's a quite good display with colour vibrancy and gool colour reproduction. Its 90hz panel so it's smooth af too. Amoled display with 90hz is just heaven. Viewing angles ? GREAT!2. Battery lifeI'm getting around 19 hrs of battery life on one full charge which is decent because I don't do much of gaming in this, I just use it for social media, youtube and stuff.3. ChargingIt's bloody fast in charging like it charges 10% to 90% under 40 mins which is quite good.And other things like processor, ram, storage is fast, looks premium in hand since bulid quality and looks are eye catching, every camera is good and can take beautiful pictures but I found macrolens camera useless.Thing which I didn't like is that it doesn't have a headphone jack so now my bose wired headphones are somewhat useless while using this phone.Thank you for reading.

  ¬†I didn't accepted from one plus brand 'Nord' please don't buy this One plus Nord .

  1. Screen :- very good, AMOLED 90hz screen is a beauty, very impressed with it.2. Camera :- images look very grainy in indoor photos, can be easily fixed with software update, using gcam for now, day and night difference.3. Audio :- was not expecting that good sound but it has very good single speaker.4. Performance :- Device not optimised for gaming.  This phone was having frame drops even in 2d games. My previous 14k phone had less frame drop than this. Although graphics were better in this phone.5. Battery :- good enough battery, not great.6. Software :- I had ordered this because of oos, but in new update they have changed whole ui and it looks nothing like stock. Stock-like ui was the reason I had ordered this. I guess I have to rely on custom ROMs just like my last phone.Edit: Now after 1 week I am completely disappointed with its performance, too much frame drops even compared to sd730g mobiles, I'm not talking about games like pubg or so, it skips frame even in Subway surf and too much frame skips in Minecraft and angry birds transformer, latter two are almost unplayable for me. These games are not at all demanding and it still skips frames in those games, terrible optimization, I was not expecting great performance in demanding games but still it should be fine in less demanding games, which it is notEdit : just installed call of duty, surprisingly didnot experienced major framedrops. They were there, but I was looking for them, otherwise smooth experience, do not know why less demanding games like minecraft ans angry birds transformers have frame drop and this does not, I did not buy this phone for games at highest setting but for smooth frame rate, which it delivers in cod but in others, fails to do so

  Great piece with ultimate specs for the price.Top notch performance.Battery holds for a day of use.Initially the phone took 2 hours to charge completely. After few days it charges on warp charging mode.Camera is great.OS is awesome, if you love stock android you would love oxygen Os.Feature packed for the price duh.

  The phone is a mixed bag of goodies and baddies. As usual, the Unboxing experience is Wholesome and includes an amazing Red Cable Club's Membership Card which is mesmerizing to stare at for hours. As for the phone, like aforementioned it's kind of mixed review. Firstly, the display is amazing for 28k and with that 90Hz display the phone dosent feels less than an flagship. Camera is Sub-Par (which was expected as OnePlus do not have a very good track record with Camera's ), but it's not that bad either. It captures some amazing details in good-light conditions, but under low-light conditions, things go downhill. Also, OnePlus should have avoided that Quad-Camera gimmick and instead of 2MP Macro camera should have developed or perfected the Main sensor for Low-Light conditions. Also the front shooters are good, but beautify the photo too much, that the photos look unreal. Also, didn't quite understand why OnePlus introduced 4K 60fps video recording in front cams, and deprived main camera setup of this. Other than that, the phone is as good as one can get in this in this price-point. The OxygenOS is alone an amazing reason why you should choose this phone over others. It's beautifuly optimized and together with that 90Hz panel gives an flagship like performance (apparently). As for actual performance, 765G is not an bad chipset and is decent for casual gaming and more than enough for smooth performance in  daily life. The battery is amazing and so is 30W Warp charger. So, the bottom line is if you want an future-proof smartphone with decent performance, go for this one. But if you are looking an device for Heavy gaming or Mobile photography, then this is not an ideal phone for you. Finally, no device is perfect, but this one without an doubt is bang for buck.

  The phone is amazing in terms of experience, customisation, battery life and camera quality - yes, the rumours about camera quality isn't true and I'm very happy with it. However, the seller and Amazon showed a special reviewers edition on my order that I never received. Even after complaining to Amazon customer care, I was asked to contact seller and seller forwarded my query to Amazon, hence passing the buck! Not a great experience!

"
"

  Been using this phone for about 15 days now and I think it's one of the best phones in this price range. Everything is good. I mean it's not as good as a flagship but in this price range everything we have is amazing. The screen is amazing. And you can buy this phone for oxygen is only. Cameras are good, primary camera is great and wide angle is good too. But other two are just there for the quad camera perform and nothing much they don't have manu use here I mean the depth camera is good but if you cover it and then click a portrait pic then also you will get the same pic. But overall if your budget is under 30k then go for this phone you will love the experience.

"
"

  You buy this. You won't regret it. Amazing display. Great battery. Brilliant face recognition. Surprisingly customisable UI.Just that the camera quality is not top notch. I mean macro could have been less softer than is right now. Probably a software update or a better camera app will solve this problem in future.

"
"

  A mix of everything for the mid-range phone buyer. Highlight is the software and the experience. All other offerings are above average and meeting every need. Can't expect premium stuff from a sub-premium offering. Do your research and go for the phone if it ticks your boxes.Recommended as far as I'm concerned.

  One of my biggest bad decision to buy oneplus nord. One of the useless phone I have ever seen. There is several reasons behind my sentences.1. There is no 3.5 Jack so u have to buy Bluetooth earphone, and Bluetooth is not working at all. It's not detecting oneplus earphones and if it's connected it will disconnect in few minutes. Go and search on Google u will get lots of topic regarding this.2. Phone music quality is too bad on every earphone.3. Phone doesn't have SD card support, so you can't take any backup directly to external memory. What was happened to me and I lots approx 300+ contacts and huge amount of photos.4. The mobile software has huge bugs and I am damn sure it was not tested properly.5. Mobile has plastic body, seriously for what I paid this much amount. Backside Chinese logo?6. Battery is too bad, even it's not capable to run for full day.I just want my money back and take this nonsense, most irritated device.

  Worst Display.It is having green tint issue not only in dark mode or dark environment. You can see the tinting also in Google Chrome opening page . Shades of green and different patches of whites sha des are clearly noticeable. Display is really an issue . Do think before buying

  After waiting for 8 days I received my One Plus Nord. Let me tell you frankly it's not as good as they have hyped in the media's as a Marketing strategy. It's a product in the middle segment which can be priced between 17k to 23k and now it's a bit over priced.Pros:#Good software which doesn't make you feel any lag while using many apps#Quick finger sensor and a quick charger is a great plus# An awesome display with a good touch feel# No unwanted ads & notifications like what we see in Xiaomi and other Chinese phones (Also no unwanted softwares too)Cons:#Camera is not up to the level of my expectations#Battery life is same like other phones with same battery capacity, won't meet whole day use# Sound quality is not good need to improve.

"

  Color distrotion with change in viewing angles on white bright screen and its look like a cheap display...also able to see the same color shift in the middle of the screen to YELLOWISH (PALE) affecting my daily usage even the night mode is turned off. Check your device guys and replace/refund if you face the same issue....thanks to Amazon refund policy...You are paying 30k not for such a cheap experience

"
"

  Yup, the title is completely correct.  I never write reviews because it just isn't my thing. Let me tell you the REAL TRUTH !For the price this phone serves the purpose, well actually serves the purpose real good.First of all camera is great, for those saying its really bad and didn't expect this, you guys should've seen the camera in 6t and 7 when it was launched and those were real flagships not some midrange phones. Personally i've installed gcam in my phone and my mind was personally blown away with the difference a mere software can make with the images. So point 1 install gcam.Point 2, phone definitely doesn't feel cheap or less durable in any way. Glass back is good, and it even has nfc which i personally love. Small things like alert slider add to the experience. And oxymorons comparing it to pixel 4a tend to forget that it also has plastic body. Personally i'd consider a phone with decent hardware and fabulous ui better than vivo or oppo with metal frame and glass back with ads popping in your homescreen.Point  3,the battery is also good.  I mean its not exceptional or anything.  I'd be lying if i say that it will last you an entire day with heavy usage. Iphone users won't complain about the battery if you know what i mean. I've been using my phone at 90hz and it is giving me 6 hours approx screen on time and this is not bad. Plus the charging is really good, inbox 30 watt charging can easily give you 0-50 percent in 20 minutes.And lastly my dear gamers, this phone IS CAPABLE OF GAMING.  For all those saying this can't be used for gaming never did the real tests. Most of pubg players would rather play at smooth 60 fps than hdr with shadows on. And i played 90 fps and never felt any lag personally. After a god 40 minutes or so cpu starts to throttle a little bit but that's expected because this is not sd 855 or 865. But you definitely can game, it's not a dealbreaker. Other games such as asphalt or cod run well. Only drawback i can mention here is lack of headphone jack which would've been handy.All in all a good phone, those experiencing bugs or software issues don't worry oneplus has already addressed the issues and are working on a software patch to fix this already. Oneplus is not a brand that will ditch its customer ever. So chill guys! this is a decent device and you can buy this without any worries. Hope this cleared your issues

  Continuous loss of internet connectivity issue is most worst thing I noticed in this for example if your searching something on Google it will show no internet connection and same thing i did with other phone using same connection it was working i was  able to search and if your playing  multiplayer games like asfalt 9 or amoung us at that time you will face server issue and it was working in other phone same application using same network .I think one plus need to fix this issue asp.

"
"

  First things first this is so handy, right size and right weight. The phone does look premium and plastic frame does not make it look anything lesser.The width is lesser than the other one plus models that let you easily handle the phone with one hand.Camera is awesome, my hubby has one plus 7T pro.It appears to me that I could not typically compare Nord's camera with that, Nord gives a different experience and I like it!The scrolling is not as smooth as the other one plus models but the 90Hz refresh rate helps.For the battery, I just switched from a Samsung C9 pro and the warp charge is a bliss for me.Not to mention about the clean oxygen os, design and notch hole selfie cameras.Overall I feel really satisfied for the money spent.

"
"

  First of all 28k is not a midrange. One of the worst image processing at this price. Totally disappointed with camera. Poco, realme takes better images for below 20k. Don't believe blind oneplus phone. I have seen oneplus 6t. I thought it would be atleast like that in camera. But utter waste camera. If you don't believe pay the price and know it. If return option were there i would returned and bought realme x2 pro.

"

  If you're having Bluetooth earphones other than OnePlus, avoid it.Having bought the phone more than a month back and used it, this phone is the worst in its segment. Riddled with bugs that refuse to go away, few of them are listed below:1)Bluetooth: The worst aspect which has been flagged by multiple users on OnePlus community and continuously ignored by OnePlus in its 4 updates rolled out till date2)Call Recording: Again riddled with bugs that hasn't been fixed. A simple google search can yield multiple instances for the same3)Slower internet speeds on cellular data: I generally use google podcasts for my podcasts and even after multiple threads dedicated to ask for help, the OnePlus Nord provides slower speeds on cellular data than those on wifiThere are many niggles which range from irritating to infuriating but overall, being my first OnePlus device, I wouldn't advise anybody to buy this one

"
"

  Nord is'nt a flagship phone of oneplusDue to the low budget we need to comprises certain things..But in this case nord is a fraud device that sell by oneplusThe image quality of the nord is'nt same as the oneplus 8 , but oneplus claim that the camera and camera sensor of the both device is same , if that was true why we don't getting good quality pictures same as oneplus 8  on nord.The second fraud thing is the 5mp depth sensor camera, the camera is just a gimmick that not doing any part on  the depth sensing it is just a fake camera( marketing strategy)And the final thing is the proximity sensor issue while calling , the screen off time is a bit laggy that compare to other devicesI don't expect this kind of incidents from the reputed company like Oneplus

"
"

  I heard about the quality of one plus but it's experience is horrible.1- One can expect good battery life, finger scanner, but this time one plus nord is failed.2- camera, and touch are good.3- Heating on charging, uses,taking much time is charging and very fast battery drainage...... Are enough to fade up anyone.4- Due to excessive heating mobile stop recording, it's functioning.5- Amazon and one plus will be responsible in case of any accident/ mishappening due to the mobile provided6- It's suggested not to buy this poor product bcz 30k is very high price for this under perform mobile. It's performance is similar to 15k cost containing mobile.7- I am feeling cheated by one plus and amazon for this piece of junk.*I want my money back without any delay*

  1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)

  Budget phone! I have use oneplus 3T , oneplus 5 and oneplus 6 and this nord can not match the signature oneplus look and feel.Hand in feel is like normal budget androidDisplay is no doubt good.People who use budget phone and want to try oneplus can go for it bindas u will the smoothness of oxygen OS

  AFTER USING ONE MONTH :-I got the delivery of this phone in 3rd August ( before 1day of launched). For this thanks to amazon. After using 1.5 month I am happy with this phone. In early time it seems a battery draining issue, but after 5 updateds in one month, now it is in a stable position. Now It's give you 7-8.5 hrs screen on time. It's fingerprint reader and face unlock is just lighting fast. Gameplay is upto the mark. There has no place to complaints. In fantic mode graphics and gameplay experience is actually enhanced. Camera is decent, not very good. In daylight camera performance is good, but in low light, it struggle. Selfie is also give you a decent performance. In daylight slow motion work properly but In low light , slow motion is just disgusting. The lights are blinking all the way in the video, for which you can't take any slow motion video in night. I reported it to the customer care of OnePlus and send them a video sample. They said to me, they give an OTA updated for this problem, but till now it is not solved by them. Except this, I don't face any issue with my phone.CONCLUSION:-This is a phone with 5g ready(which is currently waste, bcz in india there has no 5g). So, If you are looking for a balanced phone, not specialized in any section, want to experience oxygen os, take a phone for 5-6 years....then it is for you. Otherwise there are many phones in market in this price range, which are specialized in one catagory (like camera, processor etc).Is it helpful for you, then tap the helpful button.

  Okay, I was extremely excited for my first OnePlus smartphone.Most of the things are awesome in this price point but there are few things which is disappointing.1) Camera: It's good but not best for indoor photography. But as I observed, it shows the picture and after capturing and processing, it tweaks with contrast, colors, etc etc.. Therefore, I assume the problem I mentioned can be fixed by an update2) Battery: It's neither good nor bad. It lasts for 5hrs to 8hrs depending on the usage @90hz refresh rate. But downgrading the refresh rate to 60hz and enabling battery saver pushes this to 8hrs to 10hr average. But using this @90hz without battery saver is the one I do because of the fast charging. It's just awesome! It charged 60% to 100% in 20 minutes.I am coming from a low budget android *Redmi note 3*If you are thinking to upgrade from any similar or equivalent device, I would definitely recommend to do so because those are the only two problems I faced tbh. and they are not as problematic. The oxygen os with this 8Gb ram, SD765g, and 90hz display is extremely smooth.

  The phone is dope on both software and the quality. The camera quality is great but not that great when it is in macro mode . There are a few bugs when using camera on certain apps , the quality of the photo decreases. The battery life is good . The wrap charging is not upto the point . The front camera notch gets me irritated while playing games as some of the buttons go under it and you won't get to know. Other than the bugs , this is the best phone in premium budget category.Once you start using OnePlus phones you never want to go into an another mobile company . OnePlus is ‚ù§Ô∏è

  Great phone.Great price.I am amazed with warp charger as it charges within an hour from 19%to 100%.I was new to oneplus so didn't knew that phone should be charged with company charger and lead else it could affect battery life but getting used to it.Though Nord is a cheaper version of oneplus but I found it premium quality and upto mark in all respect from camera quality, finger print sensor to multi tasking.Battery is good but will last only one day or less if you are a heavy user but since charging is very fast so you are least worried.So if you are looking for a premium mobile that is 5G enabled plus less than 30k go for it, you won't repent.

"
"

  Really loved it.Using this for a day, and its really amazing and I love it.I didn't observe any tint issue on my piece at least. Even if there is any issue at low brightness, that doesn't effect the regular user in anyway.The only competitor I see to Oneplus nord at this point of time is Realme X2pro.If you are confused between these two:1. Go with Realme only if you want it for games and want the 55W fast charging.2. Go with Oneplus if you want an overall great experience, with the software, camera, changing, processor. And I think it's perfect phone at this price segment.Pros:1. 90Hz display.2. Oxygen OS.3. Stable 4k Video recording.4. 32mp front camera does a great job.5. 5G support with a great processor.6. 30W charging and battery that lasts for a day on heavy use.7. Assured software updates for 2 years and security updates for 3 years.Cons:I really don't see any cons, at least, at this point. I will update my review after 1 month of usage.But I think they can improve the camera for low light conditions, and I expect that gets fixed with the future updates.

  OnePlus Note could have a much better improvement, but OnePlus did not pay much attention to it.  One is that its battery is given very little, which gets off very quickly, and the matter of display has been given to the display.  But it does not appear that it will be not displayed.  With this, the best display works in the country and the maximum problem is one of camera and the other of battery.  Once in a while the camera is never able to capture the photo.  Blocks most.  Photo and battery drains very quickly, so maybe Banda Plus had to pay very good attention to both these things.  The rest of the operating system is good.  works great.  There is no harm.  The fingerprint sensor is also good.  Its video stability is also very good.

"
"

  ¬†The phone performs as advertised. Smoot and no lags or stutters so far. Have been using it for about a month now. Main 48mp sensor does well, wide angle is good when there's plenty of light. Macro lense I would say is useless I don't use it. Updates have made the cameras and overall performance better.Display tinit issue is present on my device but after few weeks I stopped noticing it and have attached a video also. Video makes it a little exaggerated*At first I thought it was just too severe  of an issue to let go but then you will just stop noticing it. So didn't opt for return or replacement. P.s.Amazon had offered me a full refund or replacement option.Battery life and charging is good I get about 7.5hrs and heavy usage 6.5hrs  SOT @90hz full time.

"

  I purchased this product on prime day sale for ‚Çπ26,500 and I would say it is worth of every rupee I paid. The charging is really fast with the 30W charger. Camera quality is not really great but quite good for day to day use. Fingerprint sensor works really well.90 hertz display is really smooth but battery consuming. just one thing that is missing from this phone is 3.5 mm jack, so Mostly you have to use Bluetooth headphones.

  One Plus quality is amazing but Had a bitter experience with exchange . The delivery guy didnt hand over the new phone, stating that Verify your exchange option is showing up in the app. Please contact the customer care. After contacting customer care, they didnt help any aspect. I had figure out myself. On the day of delivery, you would get an sms, after clicking on the link provided in the sms it opens in the app and Verify your exchange option would be displayed. After that exchange was sucessfull. Amazon needs to train the delivery agent, how would a buyer know all these things. I had already paid the amount online.Phone quality is amazing and camera quality is good. Fingerprint sensor is ok not bad.

"
"

  The product is great and got 3 system updates. After that the phone is working really good and camera is really good(it's not as bad as people criticized). I have personally taken a lot of photographs in nightscape, Pro mode and the normal mode the pictures are really very awesome. Macro camera doesn't matter you can go near the object and click from main camera it's greatPS: You won't regret buying this product.

  I've been using my OnePlus 3T for almost 3 years now and I still didn't feel the need to upgrade from there since my screen of that phone is gone. Being an OnePlus fan I was eyeing for 7T. But I couldn't justify the price for that according to my day to day needs.So not being a hard-core user of mobiles I started looking for other options which will fulfill my usage without spending extra bucks. And the day 1+ announced the Nord i knew this will be my next mobile. It's a fantastic daily driver with decent camera quality (unless you're a mobile photographer please wait for the Pixel 4a)Now coming to my pros and cons-Pros:1. Battery life is excellent. Getting almost more than a day with 100% charge.2. Display is fluid and ""big"" (do keep in mind I was using 3T for 3 years now so screen is a big improvement for me. May not be valid for the ones who has used 5T or 6T in recent times)3. Still love the Oxygen OS with the add-on features4. Bluetooth connectivity is fast. I'm using OnePlus Wireless Z earphones which connects to Nord quite fast compare to my 3T5. Design is good though I still love my Gunmetal design of 3T. Don't think any other latest 1+ phones can beat that design (just my perspective)6. Signal strength is good too. Don't have any problems with my cellular calls.7. 128GB storage is plus.8. Already received 2 updates within a week.Now coming to the cons -1. Camera set-up. I really don't like the design of ""Quad-camera"" set-up at all. The kind of audience they are targeting with Nord i think it would be much more appreciated if they just give 2 camera selection with some good image processing software.2. Now talking about image processing unit, they could have done better. I mean night images are okay but it could have been good. If they followed the simpler approach like pixel 4A I don't think anyone would buy Pixel unless someone is Pixel fanboy.3. Next thing speaker. Again this is decent mono speaker but they could have added stereo one instead of macro and useless lens. People like us we don't do macro photography and never going to do it with a phone but we will definitely watch some videos and songs on our phone. But don't take me wrong because quality of the speaker is good but it lacks the base. Compared with my wife's 1+ 6T (yeah we got 3 OnePlus phones and one earphone in our house)Summing up, 1+ Nord is a good budget phone for those who are planning to use it on day to day basis. Good screen, good battery life, decent camera and speaker will definitely justify the price. Having said that it would have been a real ""budget killer"" if OnePlus opts for two camera set-up with better quality and stereo speakers. My take if someone is really into mobile photography then wait for Pixel and buy that without any second thought. But if you want a good phone and ready to compromise the camera quality then look no further. Hope this helps. Cheers

  This review comes out after using the device for about 10 days and the performance is not good at all. I have been using Samsung & Huawei for so long and I didn't have any issues so far. This is my first product from One Plus and it's really something that everyone should think off.... this phone is really not worthy to spend.1. Touch response is not good2. Sometimes it's stuck for a sec or few millisecs3. Battery life if Okay4. Camera is good

"
"

  If you are thinking of One plus Nord then don't think and compare with other phones. It's doesn't make sense to buy Nord. By buying this mobile, I have lost image on 1+. Even 10k mobiles have better camera than this. All camera's are useless just to have grainy pics. Back body is plastic. Also have heating issues. If think of replacement which will never happen so forget about replacement. Big no for 1+ Nord..

  ¬†Defective product received from amazon,A 12 gb ram cell phone gets complete hang on its very 1st day of use, it was un acceptable,Battery drains rapidly, network reception too weak, unexpected from amazon, buyers can go through my video uploaded which shows it was hanged with screen on and no response showed on any buttons pressed nor it was getting switched off, had to return the product on its very 2nd day.

"
"

  Pros:Clean, functional design, infused with familiar OnePlus controls, like the Alert Slider.Super bright, accurate and smooth 90Hz OLED display, with HDR10+ support and clever auto refresh rate management.Optimal performance is extracted from the Snapdragon 765G chipset.Excellent battery life even in 90Hz mode.Competitive fast charging.Oxygen OS with more features than ever. Still one of the snappiest Android experiences available.Excellent main camera performance for the class.Cons:Plastic frame; dual selfie cam means a large punch hole.No 3.5mm audio jack, no microSD card slot and no notification LED.Single bottom-firing speaker with unimpressive performance.The 2x zoom is no match for a proper telephoto and the ultra-wide is barely satisfactory.

  Writing this review after 1 week of use. First thing is impressed with design, so classy and premium look in hand. Screen-Its so smooth, thanks to 90Hz refresh rate and display is awesome. Camera-Pictures are so clarity with 48 MP sensor and selfie camera is superb. Battery-Coming to battery i am disappointed, its drowning very fastly with video calls and works for a day with normal usage, dint try with games yet, but 30W warp charger charges phone very fastly, which is time saving. Overall phone is awesome with this price range with many features, i can say go for it. Screen guard was pre-applied to the phone, but the phone cover which comes with box, when we fix phone in that, the screen guard is coming out as it was not placed exactly...Thank you One Plus for providing best budget phone in this price range..

"
"

  I disliked the service of OnePlus community.  Community should provide accidental and liquid damage with warranty. It is difficult for customer to know the protection plan with in first 30 days as it takes more than one month to understand the phone itself. So I am unhappy with OnePlus community services. But the I like the product. It has very amazing features whatever its battery life is short but features are amazing awesome adorable.

  Their is serious network issue while playing the games as even if network is ok the game disent works each timeturn of the net and then restart untill which the enemie kills you, the phon was purchased for the gaming reason only but it's ridiculous,and service also provided by them is totally very worst and not expected from oneplus as they are asking me for lots of logs and screenshots even after sending which their react very stupidly

  Bluetooth issue overe..  no buying bro... First check Bluetooth connectivity... Next order this mobile...Im facing Bluetooth connectivity issues.. no standing Bluetooth connectivity.. worth this product 30000

  The phone freezes and restarts about 15-20 times a day. It disrupts regular usage - if you're sending a mail or typing out a text, you have to start over again once it reboots. It's very annoying if you're watching something or listening to music or talking to someone. Sometimes it takes upto 20+ minutes to reboot.The screen has some tint issues. The left and right edges have a very obvious red tint to it and the center has a green tint. It's clearly seen against a grey / white background. There's also a distinct difference in the area around the camera.Oxygen OS is amazing, the customizability, UI and user experience is unmatched compared to other OS like MIUI Samsung OS. The quick launch feature is great, it saves a lot of time for things you use frequently.Battery life is great, it charges upto 100% in an hour (charging speed slows down around 70%). Device is very comfortable in the hand, fingerprint reader is easily reachable.Camera is great, night scape and pro modes are very useful while taking photos. The case that comes with the phone is also very good, it has raised corners to raise the screen and protect from scratches.The Amazon return procedure is trash. It asks you to install an app you can't even use. The only other way to return or replace it is to wait for a technician to assess the phone.

  The phone is great!!Love the looks and feel of the device.The user interface is so fluidic and nice. Oxygen OS coupled with the 90Hz OLED panel is the best thing ever.The speaker is fairly loud. The haptic feedback is good.Camera is good, not great. Sometimes you get really good images. Not a fan of the front camera as it makes the skin look too soft. Aggressive skin softening is an issue.The fingerprint scanner isn't the best thing. Sometimes it fails to read the print.Another issue I found is, it doesn't have an option to lock onto LTE network (only LTE/3G/2G option is available, no LTE only). Hence it often drops to 3G network at my place where the 4G signal is a bit weak. My moto g5 had no such issues though.To sum up, the phone is great!! Pretty gald I chose this device over the realme/redmi counterparts :)The software experience is far superior than any of those.Also got more than 4 software updates with many improvements over a month's time.

  After One Week Of Use. Since I'm the New Customer of OnePlus Company. So I'll give the Review what I felt.1. Bulid Quality- It's Perfect in Size and Weight except for Plastic Cover from Sideon but still it looks Premium and Feel premium too.2. OS and Processor- Best OS and Processor I have ever used in this Mid Range Phones. Fastest Face Unlock in this Phone I have ever seen.3. Battery Life- It totally depends upon ur use. If It's been used for Normal battery will go for more than a day but if you use heavily it will drain soon also. Best part is It gets charged with the same speed with which it drains. Means Super Charge Phone. Haven't seen such a Fast Charging Phone.4. Now should you buy this or Not - If you want a clean phone without bloatware with almost quick refresh rate, Perfect OS and best build quality You should go for it. But if you are a heavy gamer and Perfect photographer You can't do both things perfectly from this Phone. Do remember it's a mid range phone.Overall It's a nice Phone and I have become a fan of OnePlus. Since I'm a normal user.

  Starting with the body and design... It's easy to handle and enables a firm grip.The fingerprint sensor could be faster but it does the job!The battery life is great. Charging is super fast and lasts a day easily despite heavy usage with multiple apps.The back camera in well lit conditions takes beautiful pictures with vibrant colours . The nightscape mode is brilliant as well. The front camera in well lit conditions or with flash takes amazing pictures.The only slight disappointment is the front camera in dark conditions without flash.All in all this is a great buy for the price and absolutely worth it :)

  OnePlus Nord 12gb/256 versionDisplay- very good, 90hz is awesomeSoftware- top notch, flawlessCamera- the 48mp pics are very good, details are awesome, video recording is very nice with high stability... Front camera is good too...The wide angle camera in bad lighting had too much noise and macro camera isn't good unless you keep the phone very close to the object.Speaker- it's very loud compared to my old phoneBattery- if on 90hz then don't expect battery to last long, 60hz with normal usage you can get through the day... With gaming it will last 4hrs on average maybe a bit more... Anyways the warp charging is very good...Network- no issues as of nowMemory management- using the 12gb variant, it's managed multiple apps very nicely...Final say,If you are using a lower affordable range mobile (below 20k) and change to this, this mobile is heaven...If you have changed from mid range to this, don't not expect it to be the best, but it does do everything for its price range..If you changed from higher segment to this, idk why u did that...For this price range this phone has done good...

  When comparing with 7T camera quality is worst. 0Battery 1day 3times have to charge. On call connection with wifi. Battery drains 30min 2percent always keep an eye on battery.Other china make is far better With MI & Vivi.OnePlus for 29999  waste of money

"
"

  Using one plus for the first time, and honestly i was not expecting this good build quality and fit finish.Other than standard things, display is extremely good, haptic feedback is very tight  and powerful, speaker is sadly mono channel unlike other oneplus which offers stereo set up but overall speaker is loud enough and rich in sound.Rest of the things are as expected, only one issue, which onplus didn't add type c to 3.5 mm dongle in the box.

  Earlier I was using Samsung a51 but I was not happy with the device due to horrible camera qualitySo I purchased one plus nord I have seen many negative reviews about camera in Amazon but I didn't find any negative about camera .camera is much much better than Samsung a51 so I am very happy with cameraProns-1. one plus brand hand in feel is so awesome it looks so beautiful2.Oxyzon os Samsung is no where near3. I personally found camera best under 30000 far better than Samsung A51 which cost 250004. Display 90hz refresh rate, I compare nord display with Samsung a51 Samsung was just laughing stock5. Charger is so fast within 30 min it will charge 60%6. No tint issue I faced stillCons- 1-battery drains very fast2. 3.5mm jack should have been givenOnly 2 issue I found for me it's bestI read many review that camera is showing bullery photosI did not face this issue front camera is bestSo go for it one plus is one plus no one is near

  I got the phone on Aug 4 since I pre-booked on July 28. I was really happy to receive the phone that early while others where still waiting. Buy after few hours of usage, I was struck with the issue which can be seen below in these images. So opted for return. I tested most of the aspects before the return was picked.Camera is Good for a phone like this. I also didn't feel like using a OnePlus 8 cam. Maybe the image processing is different in this one?Battery is kinda okey, nothing to boast about. Moderate usage can give you upto one day backup.Now the good parts :Videos are quite good90Hz is nice to useBuild quality is pseudo premium!(The plastic border lowers our confidence)On screen Fingerprint sensor is fast and responsiveFront cam (main) is nice. Way better than OP 8Front wide angle gives soft images and is pretty bad at low light(Same with Rear Wide angle)Nightscape is great!Warp charging is the best!And Finally the OS! No words to express its awesomeness!

  Very bad experience don't buy this product, the mobile display lighting very dull compare with redmi Mobile's and mobile over heating and camera quality very worst, don't buy this product. If you want this mobile please reach out nearby oneplus showroom and use this mobile and if you satisfied then you buy this product. I'm very unsatisfied this product there is no auto call recording also fm is not available.

"
"

  I love this product. I waited for 6 days. I had a Samsungnote 8 earlier but this was much better. There's green tint with black bar and I thought I'll manage but the most distressing thing was that there was a thin long scratch as I removed the preapplied protector. I've sent for request of technician hopefully he addresses the issue and replaces it

  Totally satisfied with product build quality, Performance & Sound, One plus delivered a good product in this price range. Thanks to Amazon for delivering the product in 4 days üòçüòçPros :1. value for money,2. Build quality, design was good.3. Very light weight & easy to carry, weightless4. Audio quality was superb very loud in speaker5. Display was nice & excellent - Fluid Amoled Display with 90Hz Refresh Rate6. Good Battery Backup last for 1.5 days & you can easily fill it using the 30T wrap charge, Heavy usage it will last for one day.7. 5G support, it may not be used in current situation, 5G may be coming to India on 2021.8. Gaming was superb, PuBg was smooth to play only in HD.Cons :1. No memory card for Extension of storage2. No 3.5mm audio jack, you have to buy Type C connector to audio output3. Battery capacity was low, it should be 4500 or 4700 mah, heavy usage it was last for one day only.4. PuBg was not available in UHD

  I was expecting something good in this product, but it is a bad experience. This is the second handset i am using , first one I've returned because of some network, bluetooth and sensor issue.  Then again i ordered another one . I am using this handset from last 2 weeks , getting so many issues , like call recording, loudspeaker , bluetooth and sensor issue. Bluetooth issue is the main issue, where it disconnects automatically.

  Features I liked:1. Smooth Oxygen OS,2. Satisfactory performance of Main camera lens,3. Amoled display- always On display support,4. Feels premium in hand,5. OIS support in Camera,6. Warp charge7. No battery issues- easily last more than full day,8. Night mode in camera comparable to Gcam,9. 5G support,10. In display fingerprint sender smooth,11. Very good quality charger & cable.. Everything is good except below:1. No OnePlus dialer & messaging apps- The Nord has Google dialer, & Google Messaging apps.2. Difficulty in call recording- As there is no OnePlus dialer app, call recording is done using Google dialer app, which speaks loudly audible to both sides ""your call is being recorded"". Third party apps also don't support call recording in Android 10.3. Macro lens poor as of now, but hope to get better with future updates.4. Face unlock doesn't work in dark.

  This device feels like half the Samsung alike shell with Oneplus Feature sprinkles.My experience:1. Display: An appropriate size display with 90Hz Amoled. Display is quality enough match almost to flagship.2. Processor: Powerful enough to forget about flagship device is not my hand. With future proof 5G modem.3. Ram & Storage: With 12GB with 256GB enough for more than daily driver device.4. Camera: It is Midrange+ almost goes to OP8.5. Battery : More than 4000mah battery justify enough. At first battery draining going. But with updating update it got fixed.6. Price: At this price device seems a little much. For me I got Over+ budget price.7. Software: Oxygen os is the best skin you could in the market. And weirdly enough they exchanged from Dolby to Dirac Audio. It is good to stick with Dolby. With 3 years software support smooth & speaker sound is very good.Final thought : At this price enough of a device. It little hurts without the 3.5 mm jack. This device is already recommended to a friend.

  One Plus NordIn my opinion, Nord is a very well balanced well structured phone that will give best results..and justified for 30k for 12GB/256GBAfter one week of my experience...... Here I listed some points which came in my mind....Pro's1. Fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate2. Oxygen OS...Bloatfree/Ad free/Clean/Smooth with regular bug fixes and atleast 2,3 years OS udpates3. Fingerprint Scanner (upto 5 can b registered)/Face Unlock are very very fast4. Camera....Full marks for OIS/EIS... With the help of these, it will take good and natural (not like other phones as filtered) images in day time and NightScape mode is good... 4K Video recording are too good in front and rear...and 4K 60FPS in front is very helpful for Vloggers5. Because of Gorilla Glass V5 in front and backside mobile will look catchy6. Light weight and easily can operate with single hand7. Alert Slider button is at its best8. No heating issue till now (doesn't tried high end games but if play mid level games for hour, it doesn't feel any heat)9. Fast Charging....53 min took for 100%10. No need to download any 3rd party app, these are came inbuilt only....Hidden Space (To hide an app), Lock Box (To hide any Videos, Images, Files etc), App Lock (To lock any apps), Parallel Space (To operate 2nd account) and Screen Recorder (To record screen operations in high quality)11. NFC, Cast Screen, Nearby Share options are there12. Several modes are there to help customization and battery optimization... Dark mode, Night mode, Reading mode, Zen mode, Bed time mode, Work mode, Life mode and Focus mode13. Inbuilt RAM optimisation is there14. Split Screen option is available15. SD 765 almost equally works like SD 8 seriesCon's1. Camera issues in low light2. Absence of stereo speaker and place3. Absence of 3.5 jack4. No external SD card slot5. Inbuilt dailer app (No automatic call record option if u record call a warning will goes to other side person...you cannot search a unknown number from dailing last digits in recent call list)6. Normal battery life....if you use heavy will get 5, 7 hrs SOT, otherwise easily come 1 or 1.5 day7. No notification indicator, but ambient display will help in that8. Absence of Dolby Atmos9. Plastic frame (But because of this phone feels light weight)10. Proximity Sensor is little slow (What i feel)11. After ending of incoming call , fingerprint doesn't work (2, 3 times only till now)12. Automatic Bluetooth connection problem (Sometimes)13. Some people complaining about Tint issue...but I didn't noticed14. Company saying 5G connectivity, but I dont think that it will not help now, because still 5G not rolled out in India

  Never could have thought that a phone by one plus that too launching in 2020 could be such a disappointment. Phone is ok in all aspects but it falls flat when it comes to camera . I can't believe how poor it is . I would suggest others to please take note before you think to buy this . Phone will perform as generally one plus phones does but camera quality will probably break your heart too.

"
"

  Its simply awesome. The device feels premium. Yeah there are issues with the battery and camera but I am sure those will be fixed in future updates. Warp charging is insane. So does the screen. Oxygen OS feels simple and elegant. Overall the phone is a great mid ranger. If they can fix all the issues in upcoming OTAs then it will be a huge success.

"
"

  Such a cheap product from one plus brandPhone is faulty and they dnt have a service center in my city.Instead of replacing , they are asking me to visit the service center which is in another city.This is insane.Why to ship to city, which has no service centres.Just grabbing customers money, zero service from Amazon and one plus.Amazon simply pushing it to one plus.

"
"

  The phone is great.  I was upgrading it from a OPPO F3 so the 1+Nord seemed superb . But when I compare this to a 7 S , the camera does a good job but the 1+7S is waaaayy better.  I am sure the 8  would be way ahead too.  The phone is fast , it clicks descent photos it charges quickly so works just fine for me .

"
"

  I'm writing this review after using the phone for a week. First two days, the battery used to drain pretty fast. I wasn't even using the phone continuously and was wondering if I got a faulty piece. But it got better now. I'm satisfied with the camera quality as well. I might not be able to give a proper explanation on pros and cons, but I assure you that it's worth the money.

"
"

  The phone is very good for my usage;  the battery is withstanding for around 1.5-2 days which is more than sufficient. Phone usage is very smooth and bloat-free. I am the kind of guy who installs all kinds of apps to try it out. Not a photo geek, so cannot review much on camera quality. If you are looking at a good budget phone with one plus branding go for it.

  ¬†The device is Amazing.. People expect alot from Oneplus n which is why they critisize if something is not according to their will however these are the same people who buy iPhone SE2 iPhone xr,x,11 for 40,000 n happy woth feature half then what Nord is providing themCamera potrait mode is meeting the expectationsMacro camera is just the beginning of reaching different league in midrange.Wide Angle is great at time a bit weird..No green light on 90Hz which everyone is claiming looks like oneplus fixed the issue..As its 12Gb Ram no lag good at multi taskingBody is good need more colors available like green, purple,intersteller,lavender..Battery drains quickly as Im a heavy user it doesn‚Äôt come to me as a surprise or shocker...Loving the overall feel of the phone.. this is a phone better then Oppo Reno latest series, iphone SE2,Xr,11

  I've been on using this phone for a good two weeks now and have been following every issue and product review of this phone including going through the entire Amazon section review for this phone. And my opinion boiling down being that OnePlus Nord is a good reliable phone. It won't fetch the highest benchmark scores or blow you away with any exceptional feature, that's a given. However, the experience is as promised with Oxygen OS onboard and the over-all performance you get out of this phone will not disappoint if you have your expectations calibrated to the price and the hardware that the Nord packs. The price point that the Nord comes at is in a sensitive range with a full spectrum of higher spec'd phones and excellent one trick-ponies in this range to the Nord, but it should also be remembered that Nord was never intended to be a Spec Beast nor deliver anything particularly exceptional, but rather it was tailored to the point to deliver the optimal OnePlus experience within the aforementioned price range. The optics, display, built and all other aspects have been all accounted for within my period of usage and I have 10/10 faced each pro and con respectively, except for extreme cases of defunct or flawed pieces..A general rule of thumb to also remember being that users moving in from higher end phones with an exceptional quality or feature will most definitely see the non-flagship performance of the Nord and that people moving to the Nord from lower end phones will also most definitely too experience everything in new light in lieu of the upgrade, so it would be good remember the conditionality of instance being reported from users..The OnePlus Nord is a good phone and it delivers fully according to its capabilities. Nothing is exceptional but nothing is garbage. Except for the 2MP rear Macro Cam sadly haha but that being said is foresable given the mixed bags that companies have to pick and choose from. I'm most happy with how the Nord functions and in absolute tune with the reality of what the Manufacturers intended to deliver to us users. Solid 9/10 for what it is was intended to be..P.S. People Concerned about the Green Tint and Display Issues should definitely check out KDCloudy's video on YouTube about the ""OnePlus Nord/OnePlus 8 Pro Display Issues"". It does a good job in explaining the nuances of the whole fiasco being faced.

  The OnePlus Nord feels premium to touch and the weight is well-balanced. The handset is easy to grip and feels very compact to hold. Camera bump is huge, frame is plastic but doesn't feel like it.There‚Äôs no 3.5mm headphone jack so had to purchase a Bluetooth headset worth 2k.OnePlus retains the slider button however it's not being used as WFH.OnePlus seems to have made no compromise with the display, a 6.44-inch AMOLED display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 408 ppi. There's a 90Hz refresh rate and the aspect ratio of 20:9 makes the 6.44-inch display easy to hold. Having said that, the device feels a bit longish and it will take some to get used to the form factor.It‚Äôs a delight to watch movies or stream content on the device. The colours are vivid but sunlight legibility is no good even with max brightness.The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors. The front camera produces good quality selfies.The fingerprint scanner is not the fastest in the business.About the performance, this device does well when it comes to gaming (CODm) and multitasking. While gaming, expect the device to get warm but it will not slow down the phone. Overall, the device manages to offer a smooth experience without any software hiccups or app crashes. For average users, who are into occasional gaming, the Nord will easily take care of all your performance demands.The WarpCharge 30T is a delight as you can get around 50% battery time by charging the battery for 25 minutes and reaches 100% within an hour for me. Battery lasts longer, refer the screenshots (taken over a month since I got the phone).The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.I got it for 26.5k with HDFC discount on Prime Day sale and at this price it's a value for money purchase.

  It's one of best phones available in the market at this price.But there are some pros and cons on this which I will be discussingPros:1.The software experience is one of the best in this price it's best after the stock android oxygen os is best.2.The display is best on this phone it's amoled display with 90 Hertz it's very smooth.3.The battery performance is very good on this device it will not disappoint you it's very it's 4415 amh battery and then comes the fast charge 30t it's one of the best charges the in less than 70 min.4.The haptics are very good on this device the touch sampling rate is very good.5.Camera performance is good but their are some cons which I will be discussing later on the primary and ultra wide cameras are good.6.Then the speakers are good on this device all though it's not stereo speakers the sound is very but not so clear.Cons:1.The first con is camera though it has very good night scape and primary and ultra wide camera but their are two cameras at bottom one 5mp depth which is not working and 2mp macro camera which is pretty useless and not of use it is very disappointing part of the phone.Their are doing a lot of gimmick of quad camera but we are only using first two cameras I was not expecting this from OnePlus this was very disappointing.But if you use OnePlus bullet wireless Z it's very good which I am currently and I One Plus buds will also work good with this device.2.Then their is no 3.55mm headphone jack as they are saying this a budget but not having headphone jack this is very disappointing as they have sell one plus buds they didn't gave 3.55mm jack it's all marketing crap of their own products.3.Then if you are a gamer I would not suggest you this phone as this device sucks in pubg it's not at all good as compared to its competitors like k20pro.So don't buy this device for gaming you will be disappointed.So that's all it's a very good device at this price point and it's future proof also as its has 5g compatibility so a very good daily driver.

  A very poor product from one plus , the battery drains very fast , the warp charger is not so fast . The camera whichbis the highlight of this phone is the real dissaponment . The back camera clicks shaky pictures 8 out of 10 pict are blurry . I was using mi note 8 pro before this on the same usage I had 45% battery left in it by the end of the till 9pm . The one Nord died at 5pm . It's a let down I think Goole 4a would have been a better choice . Really disappointed with the product . Wanted to return it . No return policy only replacement available .

"

  Purchased One Plus Nord 12 +256 varient.The phone looks classy and premium.Voice quality is superb. The processor speed is amazingly fast and it should be with 12 gb.Already got 2 updates which claims to improve battery efficiency and macro picture quality.Yes,the battery drains little bit faster but it gets charges exceptionally fast so no regrets.it charges to 80% within 45 mins. camera is much better in selfie and for close pictures.detailings are also fine.Night mode is little bit average but overall if u compare in such range then it's far better than others.In my view it is a good choice to buy this phone in 30k bucks.you are getting everything which is in one plus 8 and even more if u talk about camera.Only thing the basic screen while calling and some other basic things which are trademark of one plus is changed...it should be there.the oxygen OS is great and will be best if u give everything which is available in one plus series oxygen OS.

"

  They really hyped this particular model. I bought it in prime day sale. I was using Galaxy S9 earlier so I was happy with Oneplus android experience since it's near to stock android experience, not big fan of customized UI since they add so many bloatware.But for this price range, I am not happy with the camera, the post-processing of the image really takes away the sharpness of the photo, and it does not look clear, I tried with both 12MP and 48 MP but results are almost same.Regarding the screen tint issue, Yeah I noticed it only during the night time when the brightness was almost 0 and screen refresh rate is 90hz and the background is totally black, if you change it to 60Hz then you won't see that also, so I won't say it is an issue. I did not observe it throughout the day.Battery life is good and charging is so fast.So Overall it is a good phone but if you are looking for good quality photography then I won't recommend it.

"
"

  I don't know what to feel about the phone. It is a comfortable mid Ranger and definitely a run for your money if you want the right things. This maynot be the one for you if you need a good lense or if you need a super fast processor. It provides an alrighty experience and is certainly better than a lot of the other mid rangers and even expensive iphones.But I do have some problems. I am not a fan of any one plus cameras and this is no exception. Camera is just average. If you need a good camera, maybe you should wait for the pixel 4a. Pixel cameras are the best in the market.Another problem I have is with the battery. I saw multiple reviews claiming that it has a good battery compared to other mid rangers and some expensive samsung phones. But I cannot feel it. I feel like it's draining so fast, I should keep checking it and see if it's really not standard.

"
"

  Battery Heating issue, Camera is no way near the flagship. Even my OnePlus 6t is way better with just 2 +1 cameras. Quality of video streaming is pathetic. Audio through built-in speaker is bas and through earpieces are worst. In short, OnePlus nord is no probably the gratest failure of OnePlus brand. Other models of OnePlus are way way better.

"

  Well I am not so much techy guy who can answered all detailed query but i would like to write my honest review about this phone. I was definitely waiting for this Nord (which was rumored as oneplus Z) from March. First will talked about its packing -- Its awesome !!! Device comes in black box embedded with Nord logo...very fascinating.Then comes to display - 90Hz AMLOED smooth and refreshing colors. No issue observed about display which was rumored to be have color fade issue  dark mode. So guys dont worry !! If you worrying about display no issue from device as per my opinion.  Oxygen OS best user experience. Camera - Front and Rear Primary camera both are excellent , with coming update it will enhance. Macro 2MP - Not that much good. Speaker - Mono but still serve the purpose ; sound is good. Gaming experience - smooth no glitches experienced, PUBG user may have different view based on experience. Looks - Its cool, you will not come to know the back cover is of fiber unless said. So overall experience with this budget phone 9/10. if you really want to buy it then Go FOR IT !!!  You will enjoy the feeling

  I am not a tech reviewer but I am someone who has used this phone for good 15 days.Phone has got- Superfast Charging (5% -100% in around 70 mins) - if you say there are phone with better charging speed, sure there are, but what's the problem with this, we are charging phone not participating in race and if you do not have like 1 hour of off screen time then it's not the fault of charging speed surely you need to change your lifestyle.- Processor (does all the task smoothly, from small day to day task to playing high ends games)- Ram Optimization (switching between app is like cake walk for this phone)- Fingerprint (it's fast but could have been a little bit more snappier,  I could notice only because my last phone sensor has a better response but that harldly makes any difference)- OS(it's one of the USP of OnePlus, very user friendly and interactive)- Backup (on my off day my avg uses are like 3-4 games of PUBG, 1-1¬Ω hrs of voice/video call, 3-4 hours of Net Surfing/YouTube/social media, 3-4 hours of HotSpot tethering,  with such uses device keeps me going through out the day.)- Display - 90hz display surely makes the difference- Camera - does the job beautifully- Looks Premium - glass back panel and it's colour set it's apart

  I'm really impressed this time also.... My Last phone was oneplus 3 it was amazing buy i really like this time Nord. Will tell you my few suggessios.--------------Pro:*Good camera phone (you can compare with oneplus 8) . Impressed in outdoor picture performance*Good performance*Nice design*Video quality is pretty good*Oxygen is the best*Stunning display ( I didn't face the tint problem ... I'm confirmed)*Descent performance when u play game.*Decent battery performance*Built quality is impressed----------------Cons*Low light camera has bit grains ( but it's not that much bad)*Gaming performance is good but can't compare with other oneplus phones ( we can't compare with 765G chip with 865 ... Look at the price difference also)*No headphone jack ( I'm really disappointed with this)------Note: You can't compare with High range oneplus Phone with this phone performance but compare with camera its pretty good . Note the price difference between other oneplus phones you can understand.

  If you love OnePlus, go for it..you will not get disappointed..I didn't saw any tint issue while 2 days of usage.. ofcourse the competition models are giving better specs, but this is the most compact..loving it..camera is okay compared to others in my opinion

"
"

  It's a balanced package guy's.An excellent device for daily usage.A decent device for gaming as well as camera.I think camera should be improved in coming future through OTA's.Overall 4.5/5 from my side :-)

"
"

  A decent phone with smooth performance. I am not a heavy user of games, movies etc. This phone met most of my needs. Video quality and stabilisation are excellent. Pictures are good. Grey onyx look is amazing. Charging speed is extraordinary. I have not faced any tint issue. Overall I am satisfied. Should see if it stands amazing for longer time with no issues.Cons : I have faced the screen getting into so much dust.. like a dust magnet.

  ‚Ä¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.‚Ä¢Camera is average.macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is good.‚Ä¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did thatüòÖ‚Ä¢Premium user-experience.‚Ä¢face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.‚Ä¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.‚Ä¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it.*UPDATED*‚Ä¢Excellent charging speed‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)

  It's good phone for regular uses. Os is great. 90 hz display is great. But I don't like camera performance. It's so much colorful. Extra color in everywhere. I like natural color. And it also produce shakey images if you click and shake hand in a second. But other than this the phone is nice choice.

  Hello ALl,i purchased this phone of top varient with 12GB RAM and 256 GB ROM. However, phone's performance was not satisfactory. After my data transfer from old phone I started to use it full fledged. With no games and no movies watching and using the phone for youtube, facebook and office emails battery did not lasted for more than 8-10 hours. Fast charging was working though, but then i need to plugin again and again. It started to give me worries when during the phone calls when i used to receive, it did not worked well. either it was a UI problem or something, but there i saw performance lag while picking up a call or disconnecting it.I liked the camera though, it was good and it gave me overall satisfaction. Heating issues also was observed. Overall I was still happy with my old phone even though it has a bit of performance issue.So i decided to return the phone which I am not satisfied with.

  I have upgraded from 5T. My First impression after few days use:Pros:1. 5G Ready (At the moment, provider 5G network is not yet available but future proof)2. Attractive price3. Excellent cameraCons:1. Over heating for continues hot spot use (Really disappointing, I did not face this issue in 5T)2. When I hold the phone, the build quality does not feel as premium as old phone 5T, probably due to the cost cuttings.3. If you have old 3.5 Jack premium expensive headphones then it needs a USB C type convertor.

  Worst phone, didn't expect this from a reputed company like OnePlus. There is a major network issue with the phone and many are facing the same issue. Call is not getting connected and neither recieving calls. Have changed my sim into a different phone and found that there is no issue with Vodafone network and working fine.OnePlus team please fix this issue sooner else this model will be a dud.

"
"

  Pros:Performance is good ( No hanging issues found)Display also goodQuick chargeDisplay is good ( I did not face any display issues)Audio quality is good even it has single speakerDecent CameraProcessor is good in this price rangeOxygen OS is very good ( there is no bloatware apps like any other brands)Call quality is goodBuild quality is decentDesign and color is goodCons:Battery not enough even for regular usage( But you can charge it quickly and even it is fast charging, we need to charge 2 to 3 times per day)Camera quality is need to improveThere is no 3.5 mm headphone jack( Big disadvantage)There is no expandable memory card optionPlastic body is not good at this price range ( Many other brands has good build quality than one plus )This is my 1st mobile i bought from one plus. (Overall best in this price range except battery and camera)

  Pros :1) Smooth 90hz amoled panel2) Amazing 30W warp charging (0-60% in 30min.)3) Beast in terms of performance & lag free gaming4) Great connectivity and it's 5G (future proof)5) Superfast fingerprint scanner and facelockCons:1) No 3.5mm headphone jack2) Camera quality can be better (though it will improve through updates)3) Lack of dual stereo speakers

  This phone as per what I feel is value for money . I really loved the phone , its specs and everything . I have always been fond of one plus phones and their processors . Talking about 3.5 mm jack , then i dont feel the difference of it as most of the people today are using wireless earphones or head phones or airpods soo I dont feel the difference of not having 3.5 mm jack . Its a decent phone at this price with good performance for daily use . I m not a gaming person soo it hardly makes a difference whether Pubg or any game is good or not as havent tried pubg on this but overall this phone is good as compared to realme and xiomi

"
"

  It's been 2 months now..There is this distinct problem,while talking on call all of sudden voice drops..The very basic function of a mobile phone is to enable telecommunication..where one pluse has failed.I am feeling like wasted 30k now..Better camera.. display n other features are of no use if basic function is not working.

"
"

  Very good product from OnePlus. I will only write the areas of improvement. However this phone is far superior to other same price range smartphones, I feel even better then OnePlus 8.Few cons:1. Using Google caller app which is inferior to OnePlus caller apps used in 3/3T.2. The moment call recorder is turned on or off a warning message is sounded.3. The screen is very reflective which at times hurt my eyes.4. Google message app is inferior to OnePlus message app5. Too much of artificial moderation in photos so losing the originality. The cameras are very good only software needs improvement6. Buttons placement could have been better

"
"

  Please dont buy this product.. camera is worst... Can you guys check the issue ...i think below 10k mobile are best...in camera comparision.now  i raised the complaint but amazon executive are telling we cant do anything... its Quality issue.. if quality issue are there... You have to beard. we are not bothered ... If quality issue are there... product can't accept return because its our against policy..now i dont no what to do..

"
"

  Awesome phone!The Battery easily lasts a dayPrimary camera is classy! But...(In Portrait mode,edge detection of subject is not good...you sometimes get a blurred part of face like specs disappear sometimes  , otherwise main camera is fab)Video quality is excellent with OISPhone is smooth üòç 90hz refresh rate !Phone heated a bit while playing high end games but did not affected the performance!

"
"

  Overall the build and form factor feels good in hand. love the one plus' minimal UI. It's super fast and fluid, no bloatware whatsoever.The camera is sorta decent, not too good but not half bad either (see the attached photo for example)Battery life is a little bit disappointig. it charges extremely quickly but doesn't last a whole day.90Hz display is definitely one of it's best features that you gotta try.Overall it's a good looking phone with tons of great features and a couple of it's things that being it down.If you can overlook the battery life and you are not a pro at photography then you should definitely go for this.

"
"

  The worst phone ever with worst camera quality, not a single percent worthy. Redmi cameras are way better than this ONEPLUS NORD. Its not worth the amount. Nrver ever go for purchasing this, humble request to all the people planning to purchase ONEPLUS NORD.Even amazon policy is not at all good, they apply dual policy with customers, while purchasing they have one policy and after purchase a different one.

"
"

  Had bought it in pre sale, received on 2nd August.Had issues with Calling, the call was getting dropped randomly, solved by turning off Wifi Calling in the SIM Settings, but this problem wasn't being faced in previous phone, only faced it in this One plus.Also the Camera quality isn't that great as you expect from One plus, but the cost is also less so can't say more.

"
"

  Bought this because other Chinese offerings started to bake advertisements into operating systems giving you the message that "" nothing is free, you pay for watching ad"". Other options were iphone ( super stretch of budget for me and cost of accessories can get you another ad phone). I am a person who strictly believe that you shouldn't pay more than 35k for an leaky android considering what IOS and even a 3yr old iphone has to offer. So finally settled for OnePlus nord given the hardware at this price point : ad free Oxygen OS, SD 765 5G, 90hz led panel, opted for 8gb since ram is an old lpddr4x and not 5, decent cameras front and back, 30 watt fast charging, finally an accurate gps with NAVIC, decent haptics. Note : finally once again started to get notifications, better memory management, quality sensors like proximity, gps, no call drops with clarity calling,  after I ditched samsung a long time back for an Chinese cheapo due to the lags. Feels like quality samsung hardware with Chinese cheapos speed ( thankyou Oxygen os ).

"
"

  ¬†Great phone by OnePlus. Amazing budget. Compared the Camera with an existing OnePlus phone, did not get me happy at all. The difference between the quality of the photos could be clearly seen. I don't know if OnePlus tried to fool us, but if you check the manufacturer : it's OPPO. And I could definitely say that the camera quality could be like OPPO less like OnePlus. The Camera is great though, it's not like you wouldn't have good pictures, you could create great pictures if you've already bought the phone or if you are going to buy it, please go for it without a doubt. It's an amazing phone with excellent features which would keep you interested in it for a long time.

"
"

  Here's my honest review if you're a normal user-I'm a working professional who doesn't do much gaming. Trust me guys this is the best phone you can buy.Sexy look!Awesome speed- you'll feel this everytime u use this phone.Camera is goodBattery is superb! If u keep refresh rate at 60 u ll get very goooood backupWhat else u need in day to day life from a phone?

"
"

  On normal usage mostly while the screen is white then while we shift our viewing angles there is a red-purplish-green tint which can be seen in my Oneplus nord with naked eyes that is very much annoying and one can not live with such a major defect so I decided to replace it as the phone is very gud in other aspectsI am still willing to buy it but I am confused that was that a issue with my phone only or it is a normal issue in everyone‚Äôs phone in every unitAnd yes the screen guard which came pre applied was also not attached properly it had many dust particles in it ONEPLUS should improve the product quality

"
"

  Pros- Highly responsive as it has 90Hz refresh rate- Option of 12gb RAM- Decent Camera- On screen fingerprint reader which is quick- Stylish look- Fast ChargingCons- Battery drains lil quickly, but fast charging helps- Low lighting picture quality could be improved- Macro lens is useless

"
"

  I purchased 2 phones and both the phone had hardware issue i.e. calls were getting dropped continuously. Tech team checked and the issue was hardware. Both my phones were refunded rather than exchange. Highly disappointed. I wish OnePlus had done network testing with all the potential network providers. May be some network providers are not compatible or do not support 5G. Serious issue to be checked.

"
"

  Phone looks promising.Pros.1. Snapdragon 765 works like a breeze.2. Software is well optimized for hardware.3. Clean and butter smooth experience while using.  Can handle almost all games and apps without  lag.4.90Hz refresh rate , u will feel the difference very  much from normal 60hz display.5.Easy to use ui, no clutters, no junk apps.6. Call quality is excellent, network reception, data  usage etc. are excellent.7. Main camera and wide-angle and depth sensor  works good, selfie camera also good.8. Touch response, display are good.9. 30w charging is excellent no issues( only work  with the supplied charging cable)Cons.1. Macro camera is useless.2. Call recording feature is available but useless. It  plays a sound "" your call is being recorded""  when we hits recording button. Audible to  other person clearly. No auto call recording  feature.( People argue that this can be fixed  with software patch, but in case of nord one  plus won't change this google restrict the  removal of call recording notification sound.)3. Display is good but when u were using samsung  mid range before, u will feel that display is not  at par with samsung.4. No headphone jack (not a con) but oneplus type  c to 3.5 mm converter is out of stock always.  Other adapters available in online doesn't  work properly(significant loss of audio quality).Apart from this a minor bluetooth issue is there with nord. While using wifi and bluetooth headset simultaneously bluetooth headset will disconnects and reconnects automatically.( One plus promised update to fix the glitch)

"
"

  So after 15 days of usage here is my review1.battery life is very good lasts one day easily after heavy use charging is very fast may take 45 min.2. Screen resolution is good camera is decent3.phone is slim and comfortable in holding hands4.oxygen os is very good till date I am using stock android phone but oxygen os is also user friendly.5.this phone have many inbuilt features which are lack in stock android.6.only draw back is automatic call recorder is not available but you have to record calls manually7.sound quality of speaker is good and loud.Final words if you are looking for good budget 5g ready phone than go for it without hesitation.

"
"

  Tint issue is there. Tint issue is specifically on gey and black color and is noticeable on every brightness level. Disappointed from OnePlus display issue.

"
"

  Review after using it for complete 8 days -Keeping it simple by asking you a question. What are your priorities ?There are many competitors to nord but none of the phones are a complete package.1) The processor 765G work great when optimised with Oxygen OS.2) Amoled display is phenomenal with 90hz refresh rate, fingerprint reader got no complains.3) Battery life is great (with my usage screen on time was 8-9hours) easily goes a day.4) Warp charging (full charge at 59minutes).5) Camera quality is not that great as the macro lens should have been skipped, but if compared to other phones at this price it gives a tough competition to other phones available in India right now (attached is a nightscape shot).6) Speaker should have been stereo but the mono down facing speakers are quite loud and produces crisp sound.7) Oxygen OS (big thumbs up).8) You don't need to worry about the build (as no one snaps a phone like Jerry does in daily usage), also it is quite rigid and weight is equally balanced.This is my first One Plus phone and I would say the experience is very good. I believe that this phone is a complete package by balancing every aspect for a daily driver. It does not have one specific thing as ""the best"" but every other thing as the second best, which adds to what a complete package should be.- Not a pro gamer, but someone who uses every function of a phone roughly.

"
"

  Best phone in one plus.Working speed is excellent.Camera quality is super very quality pictures.We can quickly open lock by fingerprint reader.Battery life is good. Slim body and very smooth Screen.

"
"

  I am not much happy with this purchase. The camera is one highlighted feature of OnePlus and I am highly disappointed about the same, there is nothing which standout in camera in this phone. Macro as already known is pathetic. Also photos when captured tend to be shaky and blurred at times, quality.of pics does not meet expectations. So ya after spending 28k on this phone, with the features that I have got I am not happy. But ya if you wanna go for the brand then ya you will get a OnePlus phone, but do not expect much out of camera quality

"
"

  Oxygen 10.5 OS is good and m waiting for 11 to be available for Nord.First hand experience is good and phone feels awesome in hands. Back color (Marbel Blue is odd one out) and side bars of platic don't feel like it's a plastic and gives you illusions of metal.Good to see they provide back cover along with box.You get extended warranty for red club membership on pre-orders.Camera is good but not good enough to meet the hype one plus Nord had made before launch.30watt wrap charger is good to charge the phone within an hour but battery brick is low on capacity. It would have been great if they would have provided 5000-6000mah battery. Battery management is good and have lots of options to save battery but that will reduce you premium experience.

"
"

  I ordered it on July 28th and received it on Aug 9th. Promised delivery date was Aug 4th. Nearly delivery delayed 5 days I didn't even get any intimation from Amazon.Here is my experience:I upgraded from Mi A3 to Nord, Mi A3 has far better front camera than Nord. I'm just wondering how I'm gonna get use of 4k recording with such a terrible front camera.Wide angle and Macro lenses are useless.Battery drains so fast even if you with 60Hz refresh rate.Few Good thing with phone is Smooth user experience, quickest fingerprint and face unlock.Think wisely before you buy

"
"

  Battery life is not that good.. The battery works for 18-20 hrs only from 100% charge even when we don't use much social networking sites. It drains quickly.Camera clicks with good pixels only in daylight otherwise in dim lights it will give little grey colours. Portrait and nighscape modes are awsome.And apart from this, it is very very smooth to use

"
"

  Amazing configuration of processor,12gbram, quad camera at relatively lesser cost was a surprise, but it's not very smooth, touchscreen is very average, while gaming the touchscreen fails to recognise all the fingure moments. Camera quality is also average and so is the battery backup which requires charging more than once a day with regular usage (in next few months it will degragde)With specs had really high expectations but I think I was even good with 16k mobile as the performance is still the same.The other issue I started facing in the first week itself is phone automatically goes to silent mode and even audio for apps doesn't work unless I restart the phone, now I need to visit service center in the first week itself which requires painful data back up and formatting procedures

"
"

  Cheap looking build quality for this price, eg.1. Metallic painted plastic sides look terrible.2. OLED screen appears of lower quality than, say a cheaper M series Samsung OLED.3. Fingerprint reader is not so quick.I've got a bad feeling about the durability.... we'll see. If you're thinking of buying this phone, be sure to see it in person (as I should have) Hold it in your hand without the case. Honestly, as soon as I took it out of the box and saw it up close, I was disappointed by the cheap feel. A Redmi for half this price looks like better build quality.That said, the specs are good for the price. It's snappy, and with a case on it you won't really see the sides.BTW, BE CAREFUL not to open the SIM card slot by pushing the pin in the wrong hole! The mic hole is right next to it and easy to confuse if not paying attention. Poor attention to design if you ask me, however trivial.

"
"

  This is a user friendly, a value for money product. This is not the best or the worst , but definitely a very good phone. The display of the phone is amazing. I don't find any tint issue here. I have been using this phone for more than a week and the system is working fine. Fingerprint scanner and face unlock functions are very effective just like any other one plus device. Battery life may not be exceptionally good but for me one full day is enough. And of course charging is very fast. Camera quantity is good. However, macro camera is useless and in low light condition it's result is average. In broad daylight, the camera of this phone plays the masterstroke. Over and above, this is a good phone at this price range. I am happy with the purchase of One plus Nord.

"
"

  ¬†The best you can get. Good price , great performance. The gaming performance is exceptionally good compared to any midrange smart phones. Display is amazing. Form factor and finish are up to the mark. Only complaint i have is with the quad camera setup.the primary camera (48mp) is the only good camera with ois, the macro 2mp is just useless. Only reason you want to choose oneplus over an mi phone is the UI.

"
"

  Except camera, Everything is perfect for me. As I am just a normal user. Not playing gaming so much,so good phone for me. But as described, a flagship level camera, it is not as expected. Otherwise battery backup is good. Not experienced any leg. Neat and clean UI is best part of this master piece. Received 3 updates till the date in just one month. Very impressive. Oneplus try hard to improve quality of camera pictures by giving updates. But still not found any notable improvement. Hope in future updates, camera quality improved more.

"
"

  The performance, speed and style of the phone are awesome. Only dissatisfaction is battery draining a little faster than expected

"
"

  I am OnePlus fan since launch of one plus one, but I had very bad experience this time with Nord. Very poor quality, camera is worst, sensor not working properly, charging issues, Display stopped working with in 7 days. I asked for help from Amazon prime but they said they can't help me , contact nearby service center. I went to service center, they said they will change this defective product and will give me new phone with in 5days, but after 10days  I got call that OnePlus company cannot change my device, I have to suffer with this poor quality product.My personal advice to all customers , Don't go with this project it's completely Chinese and useless. It's just waste of your precious money. Instead of OnePlus go for samsung.

  Writing review after almost 10 days of use. Ordered on 6th Aug delivered on 8 th Aug, Good service by Amazon.Not comparing with any other phone just sharing my observations.12GB RAM and 256 GB storage and snapdragon processor so no problem with performance, AMOLED display and nice touch screen, feel good in hand.Camera quite good, on user recommendation Oneplus provided updates to improve vibrancy and accuracy of macro camera. As I am not expert of this department but completely satisfied with picture quality.Battery is 4115 mAh, which I think should be more but it last long for day with moderate to high use like 5-6 mail accounts, music, video, calls etc.. Not tried any games.Warp charging 4% - 100% in 70 minutes. Fast isn‚Äôt it? I observed battery drain almost 4%-6% during night without any use. Nord user asked Oneplus to resolve battery drain issue, hope they will soon provide patch to mitigate this.Oneplus provided lots of feature in this phone which are very handy, It is 5G enable but no use for now.Overall happy with Nord.If you have budget upto 30K I will recommend this phone.(Though you will get replacement of items but please read return and replacement policy of Amazon 2 times before ordering anything, it is not same as it was before.)

"
"

  First Amazon return policy is fraud ,they closed return window in 4 days. So take careNord box look cheaper not like 28 k phonesHere's my review after 20 daysDesign:. handy lightweight and slim. Nothing more nothing less and good lookingDisplay: clear and brighter screen with good viewing angles.And tint issue is real, but not seen in normal usage.Back Camera: main camera capture good picture and vedios in day light condition. Night mode super. All other camera need improvement, macro and depth sensor is very bad wide angle camera goodDepth sensor sometimes struggled with cropping background.Indoor image qwality not bad.latest update done some improvements and need moreFront camera: not like 32 mp need improvement.updates clear noises but not goodBoth Front and back vedio qwality is super. Optical image stabilisation is goodBattery: good battery backup with almost 1 days in normal usage after update (90hz)Performance: smooth and lag free. No network issueOs: no ads no unwanted appsFinger print reader unlock fast. Face unlock very very fastCon: no headphone jackCon: little over priced. I think 25k is okI chose Nord because this divise very comfortable to hold and great os with flagship camera performance (little disappoinment with camera). I think more updates coming to fix that

"
"

  1+ is not a top quality phone to compare with i phone or sony.just like vivo /oppo.video clarity is good but photo not as expected.touch is not accurate..periodically this is shutdown automatically .heat issue in just a half hour use.little bit hang up for opening ,to compare with i phone /sonyAnd mainly one thing it's service center utterly flop,those who are depends vytla kochi, don't go for to buy 1+.they are very arrogant and bad behaviour, its service cost is very high,take a long time.

"
"

  It's a cool,classy and totally a one hand usable phone. Not with a big bulcky screen n weight, according to me it's the only phone with these hypnotizing looks in the blue colour in this price range. Camera and ram management is above the marks obviously but battery is just descent not that much gud not too bad.Looking for a classy phone under 30k so go for it.

"
"

  I must say phone is as awesome as expected,it as awesome camera but macro is not good, and rest of the things are getting improved by updates,has some cons as well,No headphone jack,No SD card slot,But over all its a handy and easy to use phone.

"
"

  Honest review after 2 weeks of use. Absolutely an amazing and premium phone at this range. There have been lots of comparison and negative reviews about OnePlus Nord, but for me it's the best smartphone packed with balanced features. No other phones gives u premium feeling as OnePlus Nord at this range. Battery life, camera quality and performance all well above average and not to forget the quick warp charge that adds to the boost. And it is getting even better with updates, thanks to OnePlus and it's software oxygen os, highly recommend guys. If you think other phones gives u better performance, don't forget they charge you extra cost also.

"
"

  Great looking phone. I never thought I would ever own a blue coloured phone, but this color looks really goodScreen tinting / rainbowing is definitely present at low brightness but didn't really bother me. The screen is gorgeous otherwiseThe charging is super fast, and I was quite taken aback by how quickly it went from 0 to 100pct.4g reception is amazing. My previous phone struggled to get a strong signal in several areas of the house, but the strong attenna on the Nord seems to pick up nearly full strength everywhereThe OS has a few bugs unfortunately, more than I expected based on the brand, coming from a Mi phone before this. For example:* By default the alarm volume was set up at 10pct for some reason and I almost missed my work meetings the day after I got this phone* Enabling and disabling Do Not Disturb mode leaves the ringer volume at zero percent, which meant I missed a few important calls even though my phone was not on DnD/silent. You have to manually increase the ringer volume even after disabling DnD. The OnePlus forums show many others facing this issue* Bunch of other bugs related to thisMakes me wonder what else

"
"

  Using this phone for more than 10 days now i beleive i had tested it enough to share my verdict,It's overall a good experience using this phone with one of the best part is display and bad part is aswell (pointing tint issue in very low light) the interface is clean and smooth but there is definately connectivity issue with jio sim but it happened only twice in 10 days.No lag issue faced till now.Camera is improved after update (macro is such a waste)Warp charger is superr..Overall its good buy for day to day user to a moderate gamer.

  ¬†I bought mobile on 5th August 2020, It's been approx. 2 months now and my Mobile Oneplus Nord 12gb,256gb is sent to service centre on 20th Oct 2020. I was on teams audio call for around 4 hours in the afternoon and I got sensor alert of high heat, i thought It is because I was roaming on my balcony with sunlight on it. I came in after alert. Everything was ok, and suddenly at around 10pm in the night when I was using whatsapp mobile screen went completly yellow with no visibility and finger print sensor stopped working. Restarted 3-4 times but things went bad. I did not expect new launch and as a trusted brand prelaunch buyer, I should have faced this issue. Looks like inbuilt quality and electronics used inside are of very poor quality and my Mobile does not have even a single scratch on it (Watch Video). I tried to check by peeling scratch guard also from corners.Disclaimer: I am typing this from my C9Pro which has broken glass for last 1.5 years and kept it as my back up mobile and still it's visibility is very clear. I have shown this comparison to courier guy who collected my Mobile to repair center.

  Battery life is very bad plz OnePlus fix the issue

"
"

  Good productI can give below ratings for the featuresPerformance 4/5Camera 4/5Display and build 4.5/5Battery 3.5/5Decent product at this cost when compared to iPhoneOnePlus should at least provide ear phone connector with the phone since it doesn't have separate port for earphones. This product doesn't come with earphones

"
"

  I would say it's a budgest phone for daily use. Performance wise it's really a good phone at this budget especially the refresh rate,  Amoled display and the Oxygen OS. Coming to the cons, Firstly, the camera is not upto the mark. Oneplus has not maintained the camera quality in this Nord segment. Secondly, the battery drains like anything. If you are using mobile data then don't expect your battery for a long duration. Full charge happens in 20 to 30 mnts. Apart from battery and camera, I am happy with the phone. May be will have to give a review in future depending on the observations.

  This mobile is a complete failure in OnePlus Series.I got upgraded from OnePlus 6 to OnePlus Nord ., Really the worst mistake of my life ü§¶1. Poor display( lot of tint- in light theme i can see white and red tints around, even chats in messenger are blue at bottom and purple on top / in dark theme i can see grey and purple tints,100% pure black you cant see in nord)2. 3/5 Pics are shakky and lot of blur . No crisp picture. Close the depth sensor and shoot in portrait yu can still have depth effect. I'm sure there is no lens in it. It's clear dummy and cheated us with hype as 4 camera setup.3. Games like call of duty for 30-45 mins will cause heating issue.Processor and battery is fine.On day to day use yu won't feel satisfied as holding a 30k mobile.The only reason I compromised was the oxygen OS., but now the android 11 update gonna ruin it.My exchange period with Amazon prime is over. But I will surely visit OnePlus service center for another mobile replacement .

"
"

  Excellent phone at this price range..1st time oxygen OS experience..i am Fully satisfied by O2 OS..very smooth..i not used this phone for gaming purpose, so can't experience any type lagging issues.. display is good.. battery draining problems is big issues for me..i am look forwarding to solving this issue by OS updates..  primary camare quality is excellent..but macro lens not reach upto mark..i thik this is a good balanced phone in this price range by one plus..i will recommend to those people who experience oxygen OS plus good camera..go for it without hegitation..

  Brought this phone on Prime day and got delivered in 2 days, since 5 days I am using this phone.Pros-1 - Light Weight2 - Super Fast3 - Very extensive use battery last for the day also with fast charge.4 - Touch5 - Single Speeker but sound is loud6 - Oxygen OSCons -1 - Camera üì∏2 - if you use for game it tend to get Warm3 - Fast charge till 70% after 70 - 100% it take time.4 - Plastic body5 - Sometimes touch couldn't respond from different angle.Overall a good phone, looks premium but camera is main drawback, rest all is superb.

  The majority of peole say the speaker is not good. I used to own an Asus zenfone 5z with stereo speakers, and this speaker is very loud, perfectly suited to loud Indian scenarios.I'm not fond of taking much photos, so the camer's pretty decent for me. Other than that, everything else works like a charm.Some people are saying the fingerprint sensor is slow. Bruh, it's an under display sensor. As compared to other phones with the same sensor, it's one of the fastest.The face-unlock feature is very reliable. It easily unlocks the phone even if you are in a completely dark room.The battery drains a bit fast, considering the fact that it's above 4k maH. But the 30watt charging more than just makes up for it.It comes with a factory fitted screen guard, which covers the entire phone, so there's no tension of buying one.The volume rockers and the other buttons are very clicky, and extremely responsive.And then there's Oxygen O.S.I would say it's a good bang for the buck.

  I think i might have been handed a defective device by seller rocket kommerce llp.Preordered it that was amazon gimmick and fooled me before i could read somebody else review like this.Rear camera pics have heavy color distortion. And battery bakup is down right pathetic. No games installed whatsoever but still the device does not last even 18 hours on full charge with just moderate use whatsapp and instagram. Tried contacting amazon but no use. Asked them to get me in touch with seller i.e rocket kommerce llp but no help. amazon said they dont have the seller information, contact,email anything. A seller using their platform and amzon dont have the details strange or just avoiding.?

  I was really expecting the camera and amoled display from this device. But this version oneplus has such a bad camera which disappoints each time u take a picture in indoor. Images r useless and the flash doesnt have a proper range to cover the small place.About the display is not good, its just an average amoled. Samsung display found to be superior compared to this. Battery is good and speakers loudness is balance.

  After 5 days usage i write this reviewProsFluid display is awesomeWrap charger is lightening fast. Within 30 minutes charge From 10% to 100%Processor is quickRam manage apps without any lackPremium look and feel while using this mobile.Out door - Slow motion videos are awesome and next levelSignal strength is Better than my previous mobile.Overall value for money to get such specifications at this price that too from reputed one plus brand.ConsIndoor photos and videos are comparatively bad than other redmi mobiles.No memory card slotPunch hole camera disturbs phone touch movement a bitIf we turn auto sync option, our battery shall drain 100% to 0% within 10 hours.No audio jack. It is hard to find type c audio head set in market.

  First of all no phone is perfect.. so don't bother about negative reviews..Nord is much more than everything.Battery draining is somewhat hight but here there is Warp charge 30T to charge it up very fast.And reffresh rate is everything.. even in 60hz it works very fine, no need to go for 90hz until there are more heavy apps to handle...Camera is good at its segment, if u look at another phones of 64MP Nord is the beast..And gaming performance is satisfactory for a everyday gamer.. but if u are a competitive gamer being a 765g it will be not up to the mark.Optimization is very fineGo for it guys if you love OnePlus and it's Oxygen OS

  The product is an overall great package with some compromises to cut corners from the flagship device to save cost. It is evident from the plastic frame which is considered to be less premium but might be a good thing considering it offers better durability in terms of real world use cases when the phones get dropped. Battery life is average with screen on time of 6-7 hours and charging speed of 2%/min which charges the phone upto 60% in 30 min at its peak. Performance is great and casual gaming should be no problem. Camera is really great if you use GCAM installed as can be seen from samples. Software experience is great and there is gauranteed updates for next 3 years which is a must for longevity of the device. The screen is great and offers fluid experience. The phone overall experience is positive with minor hiccups like stock camera app performance, gimmicy quad camera setup(Useless macro camera and depth camera), no headphone jack and above average battery backup.

  It's my 2nd one plus device. I was using 5T and made mistake of buying nord. It's been 7 days of usage and it has already started getting hanged while watching videos, connecting on conference call and while taking calls when connected to bluetooth device. If you are using OP device already and want to upgrade then buy 7 or 8.

"
"

  This is a good phone in this price range. The user experience is amazing. The display is top notch at reasonably low brightness too. They might fixing the black crush issues in the display in the newer manufactured phones. The photos taken by the phone were very underwhelming. After the system update it got better but was still a bit soft where there should sharp details. The photos are usable now and the camera software being coninuously bein updated means it's only going to get better. The only weird thing are the volume rockers. I find them interfering when using the phone normally in my hand but that might be because I have pretty big hands. It should be okay for medium to small hands. I would definitely recommend this one!

"

  Yes, the mobile is not its worth 27,999rs  + Amazon Prime 129/month subscription* Ordered on Aug 4th 2020, delivered on 19th Aug 2020, with valid Prime membership* Go for Redmi mobile which will cost just 15-17k* Camera at its worst.  It is as worst as the basci android mobile which you get for 10000rs. Expectation was more for this range and from One plus brand*brand value doesnt exist*there is only one back cover as against 3 covers advertised by One plus nord*Battery is as normal like other phone., which was expected to survive atleast 1.5 to 2 days minimum* Bulky and not slim* display is good*please see the comparison with Samsung M30, before you go for this.to conclude: dont  buy One plus Nord for 27,999. it is worth of 12000-14000 only.

  I never write my review about the products i purchase but this time I'm compelled to write over here.As I'm not camera freak so to me the poor camera quality to me isn't big issue. But While surfing on internet the phone sometimes hangs.Also the bettary drains out soon.And it shows no internet every time i write at Google search bar and i have to off the internet connection first then on it again. Now it may be my operators issue which is Airtel but it wasn't there when i was using Mi A1.Apart from this there are little things which really takea me off like, only white flash light and no yellow LED mix. Too mich brightness even at the lowest.

  i am a daily / normal user and the phone is perfect for me.. the battery backup and charging spped is mind blowing loved it........ nice product to buy with eyes closed.......... and the OS is awwwessssommee without any lag and 90 hz display.

"
"

  This is the first time I am buying a mobile of this price range.. I never exceeded above 20k.When I heard that OnePlus is releasing a budget phone I was excited and hoping it should be around 25k... It was 5k more than I expected but I was okay cause of the value and features it brings to the price...I have been using this mobile from 2weeks now. I must say whenever I hold it in my hand.. I go to another world.. I dont want to exaggerate but the attention to details even the very small ones make this phone a one to easily own and recommend to another...Final word: A blockbuster phone.

  Camera picture üì∏ quality in night is far below expectations.Battery life looks to be good as of now with reasonably good quick charge.End up in Paying Rs. 6-7k extra on the name of OnePlus .

"
"

  My requirements while buying this phone were the following:1. It should be good to watch movies or series2. Good camera3. Play games without any lag.I am happy to tell that it has met all my requirements:1. As it has already been mentioned by most youtubers, the amoled screen has made it pretty good to watch videos in this phone.2. Camera is good enough. I am not a professional photographer so all I wanted was to take better clarity photos. Nord's camera has done decent job in that area.3. And about the third point, it's better than my expectations.

  I'm writing this review after 1 month of usage,the phone which spoiled one+ brand ... Lot of things disappointed me..1. Battery not lasting for 12 hours on normal basic usage(no games, no video streaming,no hotspot usage)2.Camera quality poor photos looks like 8mp camera3. Finger print reader response very low4. Phone heating issues5.poor ram managementPros:1.Design & look2.Display quality3. Pure android feel

"
"

  The device has serious screen tinting issues, the seller has no courtesy to replace the device. Really disappointed in this ignorance.

"
"

  Perfect device for daily driver including all your official and personal needs. This is first phone in OnePlus, though the other variants of OnePlus quite higher range, this Nord is affordable price range with all premium features. The Oxygen OS is good and intuitive surfing experience, though it has the feeling of AOSP custom ROM and UI with other phones, but it is much better. And another very important impressive thing is Oneplus Nord developer team who is analysing the user feedback and releasing the monthly patches which is enhancing the user experience and much stable feature enhancements. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and recommend to my F&F too. The camera picture quality needs more improvement as I personally feel that the pictures are average quality especially in indoor photography. Rest all good...

"
"

  Why there's no auto call recording feature? Every time we have to manually press to record our calls even the baddest part is the voice ""Your call is being recorded"" this voice note also received by call receiver. They get alert that we are recording there call. Is there any way to remove that voice note and to record call automatically. ? Its worst thing ever.

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus phone. I was expecting a lot at this price. Everything is good about this phone but the camera is not good. Not at all good. I was using motrola and oppo f7 previously their camera quality is far better than nord. I made a big mistake exchanging my oppo f7. In nord pictures arevlike just as clicked by an ordinary camera. Pixels scattered. So if you are looking for a good camera phone don't go for it. I tried to return it to Amazon but they don't have any return policy for electronic items. So I am a totally disappointed with my decision of buying NORD. It should be priced not more than 18000-2000

  2 days of use problum which i face is battery backup is very low. It drains too fast. In one min Of use it reduce to 3 to 4% from 100% of battery charge and comes to 96% and phone little heat up when 15 min of continue using. Other wise phone is good. It is charge quickly.  In 30 min it is fully charged. Camera quality osm. It is default 12 mp camera and for better image to change 48 mp. And aspect ratio is 4:3. Finger print touch great.I am marking of 2 days of use:-Camera- 4/5 (day light)Design- 5/5Display- 5/5Charging- 5/5Battery life- 2/5Sound- 5/5 (because it is dirac sound)

"
"

  Slow motion video issue inside house but no issue issue outside. Camera quality is good. But sometime it look like that it's edited photo. Sound quality is also good no issue on that. Battery life is very good

  Hi EveryoneWriting this review after using OnePlus Nord for 15 days. I was previously using oneplus 2 and after lots of wait finally bought one plus Nord.Display is awesome ,the colours are very good and realistic.Camera battery performance everything is good .Played pubg for 3 to 4 hours no lag in performanceSingle spaeker is compact and audible  but no Dolby Atmos.Selfie camera is failing to take clear shots at night time in artificial lights. While in daylight images are clear.Apart from that Best phone from OnePlus in this price segment.

"
"

  The phone is a good pick overall.Overall score : 8/10Display :9/10In hand feel :8/10Speed and quickness :8/10Software optimisation :7/10Camera :6.5/10Build :7/10 It indeed was a little hyped regarding the 4 rear cameras. I'm assuming everyone who buys this already knows about the plastic build, which isn't really an issue. The only suggestion I have for other buyers : if photos and videos are important to you.. Then buy the pixel. But apart from that I think this phone is the best phone for its price. Could shell out 5k more and get one plus 7t cos the whole 5g thing is BS.

"
"

  Finally, one plus Nord is in my hands...It's super smooth, fast, camera is just awsome, sound of speaker is just perfect, no display issues, trust me...Overall it's a complete package for those who are looking a great mobile under 30k.Amazon delivered a day earlier...

"
"

  This is a good budget phone from One plus with excellent specifications. Fingerprint reader is great. Battery life is average , can run for a day with normal activities like calling, net surfing, gaming etc. Camera quality is also average. The phone is fast and warp charging is awesome. Actually charges from 10 to 100 in one hour. Overall a good piece for 30k. Only drawback is no headphone jack either go for bluetooth headphones or get a convertible C-type to 3.5 mm jack red cable.

"

  Superb phone... Getting on to it..Display is awesome 90hzü§©ü§©Camera is also perfectMy score 8/10

  Disappointed with Google dialer and Google message apps, not auto call recording, even truecaller call recording is not working. Number search in dialer is not optimise. Parallel apps support is limited to a few apps.Needs a lot to improve.Group selfie images are not correct, skews the background

  This is the amazing device i have ever used. Previously iam using samsung devices which lags after short time of purchase (due to exynos). But this has the best experience and the 90hz refresh rate on amoled screen is just awesomeüòç. After using it for a month my opinions are :-Pros:-1. It is manufactured in india.2. Best display i have seen , neither great as oneplus 8 nor bad. You will get best screen experience. (4.8/5)3. Camera are just execellent, nightscape mode is superb and pics of front cam also great. In ultrawide mode go for in well lit scenes in low light it sucks. (4.5/5)4. Charging is superfast if u are not using it while docked.5. This blue colour is awesome and have best shade like u will never get it on any other device , its unique in design.6. NEVER face any lag in both day to day work and in games. As i am heavy user and moderate gamer.7. Indisplay fingerprint sensor is fast and never face any unsuccessful attempt as well as in face lock sometimes it take time just 1 or 2 sec due to baclight conditions.8. Speaker is best and its loud and clear but gets hot if u play music on full volume for 20 min. Earpiece is great as its very loud and clear.9. Most important thing in the phone is its UI and it has most clean UI (Oxygen OS).Cons:-1. It has snapdragon 765g but in my opinion oneplus should give us 8 series of it. But u will not face any lag.2. Provided screen guard is flexible sheet which i can't say a guard at all it will just protect your device from scratches but didn't in drop. It has gorilla glass which protects your device but always go for more safety.3. Battery drains fast at 90hz which can be fixed in OTA updates.Conclusion:-If you want a device that never lacks you behind in terms of usage and day to day work then it is just made for you. And if you are a heavy gamer then go for 7t. There are many devices available in market like realme x3 but believe me! You will never get a clean ui experience like this one really loving it.NOTE:-I suggest you to put camera guard also it will not affect your images. And don't forget to put up on a bumper guard. Provided guard is good but i think it will won't survive if it falls from back side. Remember safety is first.

  Hello team,Mobile is overall good. Oxygen OS is awesomeBut following are the Cons :-my one plus nord Mobile battery drained in 8-10 hours with  just a normal use with actual mobile usage time 2-3hours.Auto brightness Functionality sometimes adjust the brightness to very low level eventhough slightly more brightness is needed for normal use. Auto brightness adjustments does not reach to require brightness at many scenarios in daily use. so I need to to turnoff auto brightness and keep the brightness to normal requirements.I hope that you will address the mentioned issues.

  OnePlus nordThe best phone under 30k.Using as my daily driver.The processor is nice Snapdragon 765g 5g processor.The vibration haptics was appropriate and on point.The cameras were great in my point at start it was lacking of white balance and exposure but after the updates there is improvement in colours and all.Front camera is also great and sharp.But there is a slightly problem in battery life because 1 day I was using my phone in 60hz display it was draining the battery faster as compared to 90hz because in 90hz mode the battery was not draining fast but in 60hz mode it was.Comes to display,the display was great. With that dual punch hole cutout looks great and there is less bezels in all side.The in hand feel of the phone was great. With glass back and front and 8.1 mm thickness and 184 grams weight the phone feels light weight and sturdy.And üçí on the top oxygen os this is my fav part because the os is like stock and great experience.Overall the best package in 30k mark...Conclusion.For the normal use, for nice camera and for normal  playing games then goo for it.But if your are a heavy games player than don't go for this because this phone is for professional users and for normal use with stock like experience of oxygen os then go for this phone.

  First of all thanks to amazon for delivering the product even before the expected date. That‚Äôs the reason I trust amazon. One plus more is very good phonePros- 1. Super smooth phone with no lag in switching the functions / apps2. Wide display and handy (which is important to me )3. Good battery life and faster chargingCons- Camera is not that great compared to other phones in this segment . But it is really good one

"
"

  I loved this phone. I was slightly thinking about tint issues but phone was not great amazing display. best ever display in this segment. Very well optimized performance only this camera performance is little low and low light shots are not perfect. 4 cameras in back is just marketing term 2 cameras are usefull. I think oneplus will improve camera performance in future updates. Overall when you buy you really does not disappoint, you will really enjoy it

"
"

  After replacement I'm facing same issues /Problems Battery draining & heating problem. Can't set different ringtone for different contacts, at the time of calls volume icon pop up automatically. Handset is not worth. Whenever we try call conference if second party not picking up the phone then can't resume back to main caller.Need to be returned n refund.Amazon should fulfill it's policy

"
"

  Seriously Worst experince I know device is better and good but oneplus Should improve there bugs before lauched because Its come with so many day to day issues #Display Bleading issue on low brightness on Grey screen Camera bluring issue pubg reconnecting issue battery draining so much faster issue  ... !! I know One plus Solveing by time to time But my Qus is that with them why they launched so early when there are So many bugs first they Solve it then should launch then it be much better ..!! I feel like Waste my 30k should Spent Low and satisfied by samsung or instied wait fr pixel4A or Should go For Iphone Se2

  ¬†One plus NORD is a very nice smartphone with 2nd best hardware and really good software experience.Display tinting issues do exist but won't be visible in every app but only in apps with grey background and won't affect your day to day usageBattery life is good not the best but will easily last you a day even on 90 hertz at moderate usage and even if you lose battery percentage the warp charger 30 does its job and give you 50% of charge in 30 minutesAnd 100%in 1hour.Speakers are not bad has good loudness, good with the lows but struggles to produce crisp higher frequencies.And the only thing that stopped me to give it a 5 star review was the camera who's is very bad not in terms of resolution but in terms of processing, ultra smoothing of skin, noise, photos looks like if it was processed with extreme beautification mode even if not enables but don't lose hope the sensors used are very high quality and because of this this software base processing can be improved with future software updatedFinger print sensor and facial recognition are also good

"
"

  90Hz, decent processor and extremely fast. Everything works very well for this price. Only downside is the screen size. 6.44in sounds big, but in real it looks smaller compared to most other phones out there.Everything else is perfect on this phone. Coming from a Samsung, this just crushes it when it comes to responsiveness and performance. Camera is above average with decent lighting conditions and a side load of GCam

"
"

  The phone is smooth because of 90hz refresh rateBattery is well within expectations as as far as camera quality goes rear is well placed as per value of phone but front still needs improvement in indoor lighting conditions.Overall good phoneI upgraded from One Plus 3T

"
"

  Worst Phone Ever: OnePlus Nord has extreme network issues. Every now and then when people try reaching you - they hear the message ""The number you are calling is currently switched off, please try later"". I've reached out to Oneplus team to resolve the issue but they only asking me to restart device / reset Network settings which only resolves the issue temporarily. They phone helpline number keeps ringing and no agent picks up the phone and email reply is 48 hours late with template responses like ""Please restart phone, etc"".

"
"

  Design : 8/10. Missing headphone jack.Mid frame is plastic.Camera Quality : 8/10. Low light photography is not that good. Needs optimization. OnePlus 7T is much better than Nord's camera.Display : 10/10 I didn't noticed any green tint issue in my display and display quality is worth the price.Speaker : 8/10. Speakers are loud but mono speaker. You may not enjoy the speaker quality.Battery life is good 7/10 : I expect atleast 5000 mAh battery if I'm paying 28k.Processor : 10/10 blazing fast processor, no lags observed.In-display fingerprint sensor works like a charm.Overall 7.5/10.No doubt that some cost-cutting is done which is not appropriate for a brand like OnePlus, quality should be preferred while designing such phones.Its a premium midrange device so I expect metal mid frame and a good camera quality with good battery life.OnePlus is able to meet some of my expectations but lacks many important things such as 3.5mm jack, stereo speakers, metal frame.Overall a good buy if u want a 5G device under 30k.Hit helpful! Thanks.

"

  No words to say about the cheap quality.. I was using one plus mobiles for Almost 5 years( one plus 2,one plus 3 and oneplus 5t)  and this is the worst segment which I have seen. Camera quality is worst.. Finger print and battery life too is worst..Slow motion capture is horrible.. Too much blur and shake noticed.. I Definitely don't suggest to buy this.. Never expected such low quality mobile phones from oneplus even after paying 30k for 12 gb 256gb..cheap quality mobile

"
"

  Camera quality is fine for me as I am not a camera enthusiast.Vibrations feel good.Phone is snappy and quick like a flagship.No tint issues.Phone looks and feels very premium.Display out of the box is a faint yellowish, but you can change the color temp from setting to get whitest whites.The pre-applied screen protector is not that good and my unit also has a small particle/dust below the protector so I peeled it off.Weight and size of the phone is awesome.Just a bit disappointed as I had very high expectations from the front camera.Phone will get hot after first boot but then gradually it will get normal and much cooler than normal temp or redmi phones.PUBG gives consistent 60 fps will gfx tool.

"
"

  Cons: The camera quality is not that great . The battery charges pretty fast but drains too  very rapidly... Not to be confused with a normal one plus phone .. Does not hold up to the brand image of one plus seriesPros: The oxygen OS is clean and easy to use.Charges very fastFinger print scanner is good as long as you don‚Äôt have a screen guardQuick chargingFast and smooth OSMay be one plus 7T or 8 is a better option, if you are a camera freak

"

  OnePlus Nord is a heck of a phone. Got it delivered on 3rd of August. Just glides through everything effortlessly. Just press on the throttle and it launches into orbit. Cameras are just awesome. After full day of usage and listening to songs and watching videos for around 2-2.5 hours it has enough juice to last through midnight and sometimes next day. It also gives that expensive phone vibe. in hand feel is just awesome and this size is very handy and feels light. Not going to regret this purchase. And for haters no screen tinting issues at low or high levels of brightness. Thumbs up OnePlus.

"
"

  This phone gives a premium look when you take this phone box in hand. After its unboxing the first thing which looks very attractive is Red Card Membership, its cover. Now let's talk about phone. Very handy to use. After set up gives you complete premium feel. Processor is very fast. And if I talk about it's in screen fingerprint sensor it's very fast and face recognition even more faster than fingerprint. Phone is quite heavy as it weighs 180 gm. Alert button above the lock button is a very good feature. Body seems like delicate and blue colour looks stunning. Camera works very good in dim light. I will give it as 5/5 for everything.

"
"

  I'm new user to one plus family but believe it's just aswm to be the part of there family.The very first impression is look the blue marbel wow amazing feels premium in hand n then comes the software which is too smooth compared to this range phone.The most favourite part of this phone is battery charging capacity it's gets fully charged in 30 min.

"
"

  Overall a well balanced smartphone - Jack of all trades, master of none.What I feel is due North, OnePlus departed from Flagship but settled down before reaching the true 'budget' segment.If you ask for any alternatives to recommend - Not much, but how about considering an year old flagship instead?Here is a generation picture attached with OnePlus X.

"
"

  The best thing about this phone is that it runs on Oxygen OS, undisputedly smoothest and best UI available with ""zero"" bloatware.....Camera feels good, especially front ultra wide...Charging is really really fast, as we expect from warp charge....Battery life could be an issue if you are traveling but for me  fast charging compensates that....At this price point with 5g compatibility, its the best Phone available in the market....Stop wandering in comments, just place order :)

"
"

  I always go for the medium budget phones... With the announcement of NORD with upper middle budget phones, I wanted to book one as soon as it's released..Its going good as of now... And the existing issues with minor software issues and camera quality are being fixed by regular updates from OnePlus...So hopefully the mobile will exceed my expectations I have of it now...

  Good deal in this price range! Loved the phone. Decent camera quality.. premium design.. turbo charging.. excellent battery backup. Just found fingerprint scanner little slower compared to others but it doesn't matter at all. And yeah.. loved to read that.. ASSEMBLED IN INDIAüáÆüá≥

  Finally One Plue back in the space of 20k range.. Nord along with its feature rich packing is a real good part.. Finger print is fast but not very accurate  1 in 10 times you need to repeat it..Battery is working fine for normal use, but if you are heavy on Games u require a charge more in a day.. but that's not a problem given fast charging of One plus..Camera is decent for this price range,Performance is very good thanks to Oxygen Os and Snapdragon combined with decent RAMALL in all a very good phone for the budget buyers in 20k range

  My genuine review of OnePlus NordI was really confused before buying this phone, was confused between Realme X2 Pro and OnePlus Nord. Finally I came into a conclusion to buy OnePlus Nord just because of the it's brand value. Still I was tensed because I heard some display issues (green tint issues), anyway I confirmed to buy this one anyway trusting the brand OnePlus.Now I'm using this phone for 3 days, if I can express my experience with one word, it would be the word ""Fantastic""!! Literally I was so shocked with the product it was so much more than I expected!DisplayIt is the best display I used till now. Fluid AMOLED + 90hz refresh rate! Omg!! Fantastic experience üòçIn display fingerprint works pretty fast and smooth, it's a pleasure for eyes to see how this fingerprint reader works, animation gives it a premium experience.CameraThis department was the most shocking one for me. Just like it was advertised it truly is a flagship camera. Most of the photos were looking like it was captured from a DSLR!! My friends were also amazed. But macro camera doesn't stand with the level of other cameras, it's just decent, that's it.Video stabilization is the most highlighting part in the camera department üòç so much stable footage!! One word is excellent üëåProcessorI bought 12gb ram varient to get extra storage (256gb rom). Snapdragon 765G does an awesome job üëå so fast and smooth experience!! Gaming experience is lovely ‚ù§Ô∏èOxygen OSIt is the first time I'm using oxygen OS. No unnecessary ads, simple and clean üëçBatteryBattery backup is pretty decent üëç  it's not excellent but it does a pretty good job!! Charging speed is awesome !! It get fully charged within 45-50 mins really impressed with it.ConsI didn't find anything disappointing, but still if there was a 3.5mm audio jack it would have been nice, but personally I'm okay with it. I ordered OnePlus wireless z ‚ù§Ô∏èConclusion""It's pretty much everything at a pretty great price"". Just buy it üëçüòç

  Writing this review after using my OnePlus Nord for about 2 weeks. I was looking for a good daily use smartphone which had enough battery life to go for a day,good camera, smooth and fast UI and i think i got all of that in Nord.P.S - If you are a heavy Pubg gamer don't go for this device,there are better alternatives there.Otherwise go for it.Pros:-1.90Hz Amoled Display2.Warp Charging (0-100% in 50-60min)3.Smooth and Fast UI ( Never noticed a lag till now)4.Great Camera - Now coming to camera let me tell you the oneplus camera app is not so good at capturing evening & night pics , so just straight up install the google camera for Op Nord.Its going to give you better colours in pictures,better night shots etc5.Battery life - The battery life lasts me a day.I just use IG,Reddit,Camera,Work and Music.6.Looks premium - I know the back is made of plastic but it still feels premium.7.Fingerprint scanner and Face Unlock works like a charm8.Audio Experience with Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z is very good - fast connectivity and good sound quality.9.Oneplus OS timely updatesCons :-None found till now.If found will add.I have seen a lot of you are complaining about the useless 5MP depth sensor camera and 2MP Macro Camera.Let me tell you that you won't be able to use the 5MP camera because it's a Time Of Flight Camera which is used to calculate the depth of a surrounding or environment.This feature is used mainly for AR & VR purposes.Now coming to 2MP macro camera, it's average in my opinion.I didn't expect to perform it like a 1k priced macro lens for smartphone but its okay.A tip of advice for using macro - Shoot objects with ample amount of light.It will give you good shots.And please install GOOGLE CAMERA if you are finding the shots from Op Camera app not good.

  Finally after waiting I have received my first OnePlus Nord.Coming to the first impression, it is a very premium box. The phone feels too good on the first touch and the back cover looks great on the grey color version. Couldn't wait for the blue one, but grey looks good too. Blue by the looks feels more classy.The initial setup of the phone made it a bit warm and I have to check for more days to see if it's an issue.Fingerprint isn't that smooth and one has to wait. It would need some time to compete with likes of samsung or honor in that department. It is a bit slow.As per battery drain , I haven't seen any. I charged once fully and on normal usage of whatsapp,twitter , some calling I didn't see any drain. Again have to check with video calling and youtube videos. Not a gamer, so I feel I should be fine.Coming to camera, the 48MP main camera is real good. But apart from that sadly everything is medicore or less than mediocre. They could have gone the pixel 4a way of giving one kick-ass camera. But the depth sensor, macro are bad. There is no clarity. Full grainy. Night shots are also pretty bad.The OS again stands out and has to be the reason number 1 to buy this phone. If you want a good feel while typing , this is the phone. 90hertz is quite responsive and you feel the difference if you type fast or shuffle between apps quite frequently.Instead of macro camera, they could have surely increased the build quality. Or by getting rid of 4 cameras,they could have added wireless charging to make it a really good deal.Comparing to samsung a70, realms X2 pro it is better overall.No bloatware makes it again a better deal.Thanks to American express offer, got it at the price for 8GB.

  Pros :Good screenOxygenOS optimizations are good.Primary camera is okFast chargingFast fingerPrint ScannerBattery life is decent.Cons:Quad camera is useless only main camera is good.Front camera have soft output.Speaker is tiny.Frame is made of plastic.No headphone jack.

  It may fit into the low budget cost phone..Some specifications are really good..But once get connected to bluetooth while hearing song from youtube it ll automatically disconnected Nd then reconnect again ..While using bluetooth headphone having some distorts and n video call it seems to put some extra effect of resolution rather than original picture looks  or  from one plus 6/7 video like..They can give resolution of wat cost upto..wen n video call it seems to be so whites rather than wat actually upto..Who used before series of OnePlus ..it wll be lesser option to opt

"
"

  Good phone thumbs-up OnePlus  really we couldn't ask for more in that tight budget clear os punchy screen smoothnessCould be much better in camera but nodoubt great fone offering premium quality with 5g in  below 30 a big yes who want to buy nord go for it guys

"
"

  The phone is fantastic, feels great, looks super, and works great, and that's from a person who got the Nord after using 6 for a couple of yrs. The only problem, and to be honest it might be bad luck, but the internet is awful, now it might just be jio seems to have overstretched themselves, (memories of CDMA) and we await a new provider, or its NORD.

  PROS:+ Feels very premium in hand (it is actually)+ Premium Design+ Camera:  *48 MP Main Rear Camera takes excellent pictures and videos in natural light conditions  *8 MP Ultra Wide Camera does its Job (Little Resolution Drop while using)  *5 MP Depth Camera doing Average Job  *2 MP Macro Camera takes pretty much improved shots after an update from oneplus  *32 MP Front Camera takes Excellent selfies  *8 MP Front Ultra Wide camera gives very good photos+ Very Good Gaming Performances+ No Battery issues+ Sound Quality Pretty Much Good (Not a stereo Speakers)CONS:- As a seen from others review i can see the display colour issue while using in DARK MODE. Display issue means not a pure black colour shown when switching to Dark Mode. HOPE IT CAN BE SOLVED BY SOFTWARE UPDATES- If they given 4500 mAh Battery, that would be awesome

  I ordered the 12/256 blue marble nord on 6aug and recieved it on 8aug... All credit goes to amazon for sure. Now about the nord... Wot a product... Such an amazing colour wonderful experience.. charging v fast (2-100%) in 55 mints no battery draining ( easily lasts fot one day or even more on normal usage) as i am continuously using it for 3 days. No words for display its at par..For camera part i must say it takes the most natural pics with every single detail.. the ones who only feels that camera that beautify the pics is actually good ones should not prefer this phone.. but the ones who want to enjoy the detailing and mesmerising beauty of nature should certainly go for it, takes lovely selfies thnx to the 32 mpxl.. ois is simply a feature that makes it simply better than the rest in this price range... No display issue (green tint)... Its true that dolby atmos is not there but DIRAC  is there to give u the surround sound effec..., despite having a mono spkr it is sufficient to enjoy any music or video... Most handy phone i have come across perfectly fits in anybodys hand.. final verdict a gem of a phone for daily user who doesnt want to compromise on any feature..its atlst second best(next to flagship) in every aspect if not the best...

  Thanks to Amazon for Fast Delivery as promised for Prime Members2nd thanks to Hfdc Bank for Debit Card No Cost EMI. It cost me for 27k for 12gb/156gbAbout OP NORD : 5G network still not available, Camera average nothing new surprising, About Display like these u can get in any 20k below mobile Amoled with UFP. Apps like XShare XClub are from Infinix mobile. AR not compatible and no options for GCAM App install. Battery backup not impressive but thanks u get 30w fast charging. Go for OP 8 it's a best choice. I given 5 star only for Oxygen OS stock Android like experience.

  Firstly, I need a phn for 3years and above and then I got to know about nord very well after watching many reviews on it, and then I dared to order it against its negativity just by trusting oneplus , and then finally I got my nord on 26th of august, Im really impressed with my nord. It is super fast and the display is amazing. As I went through all the reviews before buying, I checked all the cons immediately after receiving. I would to mention few things that i obswrved on my nord are:Coming to display, I dont have any tint issues & the display is soo smooth and very fast to access.Coming to camera performance , its is absolutely good and satisfied (except slowmotion motion at indoor has screen flickering issue and macro lens is completely blur,other than these the camera is absolutely fine at both indoor and outdoor).Coming to Battery , it is good bt not outstanding(On continuous usage , U can use it for 10 hrs), and charging is super fast.Coming to processor ,it is super fast and yes ofcourse it can handle pubg and other games without any lags.And I dont have any network ,sim or bluetooth issues .And last but the best , OXYGEN OS is just wooww.I also received 2 software updates till date and will definetly inform what i noticed from it after proper  usage.Finally I loved this nord and im absolutely satisfied with my product .I definitely recommend nord at this price range rather than other mobiles.

  I bought the Gray Ash 256 gb variant for Rs. 28750 during the sale.Pros:Build: The in hand feel is great. The Ash gray color looks premium of all colors.Camera: It is decent for the price. Do not expect a flagship performance. I did not find any issue with the camera.Display: Display is great. The colors and display angles are good. I did not get any tint issue with low brightness.OS: Just loved the oxygen OS. No bloatwares, No ads and smooth. Oxygen os was the reason I didn't buy samsung or realme or mi phone.Performance: I played COD and didn't find any frame drop.Battery: The battery performance is also decent. The battery lasted 1 day with normal games and video usage.Cons:- No stereo speakers- Plastic body

  Very poor battery backup need to charge at least twice in a day to work with it...camara quality is average.... if we ignore 5G feature which is useless as of now...all other features are easily available in any other 10K range of phone with best battery back and camera.... after using around  three months I feel it a waste of money..i bought it in around 30K but you can buy any mobile around 10K with better features than this mobile...

"
"

  Anyone Buying this Smartphone and is here to see the Review, i want to say that ""Close your Eyes and just Click the Order Now Button""This Phone is so Awesome from every perspective!Before buying i was also so confused, i watched tons of youtube videos,And many of them were saying that Camera is Average, Build quality is not nice, feels cheap etc etc.Just Ignore them, i have bought and using these phone for atleast 2 weeks..And must say 3 things are the best in this phone:1) Display2) Processor & Battrey3) Camera (except the Macro one)

"
"

  Overal very good phone.Battery doesn't last very long not even a day.But that was not a concern, charging only takes 45min. So it's alright.Camera is really good. It adds a bit of warmth to all the photos, compared to samsung, amdni personally like the warmth, which adds to the reality feel.And fingerprint scanner is one of the best out there.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is really a good one compared to any other one in this range.Battery life is somewhat ok sometimes it is getting more than 1 day if ur using just call and some net surfing.If u r gamer then the battery is not up to the mark only getting 8-10 hours with max 2 hours of game play.Camera The main sensor 48MP is good but it can't be used for zooming purpose if u want to zoom and take its only supported with 12 MP sensor overall the 48 and 12 sensor is doing a decent job .Talking about the other two sensors 5MP DEPTH sensor is good that's all not an excellent one.But the worst part is the 2MP macro I don't know why they included this sensor may be for the quad camera namesake, the most useless one this phone.And overall talking about the phone the processor 765 is futerproof and giving a good performance, simply it is Jack of all but master in nothing. I faced some hang issue with Twitter twice, leaving that no complaints until now.And the best and most interesting part is the oxygen OS, it is working like smooth butter.Overall the oneplus is good in all, but not a master in any section.For a regular user the Nord is ok

  Lovelyü§ó, sleeküí•, stylish and Shimmeryü•∞‚ú® pastel design. Not even trying to use it as it would get dirtyüòÖ, viz. it's so like a Touch me not plantüçÄüòÖ, so clean. It's my first OnePlus devise, so instead of becoming skeptical due to so much critics by many a youtubers, I'd still like to cling with it due to its Oxygen OS, and clutter plus bloat-free experience.

  I just got it yesterday,after pre ordering it on 27th July. So far so good. Ui is smooth. The feel of the phone is good. Easy to handle. The camera is exceptional as promised. Wide angle option on front camera is cool.

  An absolute wastage of money. The product worked fine for initial 6 days, later faced issues like battery draining, mobile heating, mobile lagging, when I tried to replace it, the return window was closed. I tried to contact the seller, 3 emails and the seller has not bothered to reply to a single email.So I visited the OnePlus store where I was told that certain 3rd party apps cause bugs and lead to battery drainage or lagging issues and I should wait for further updates from the applications so that the OnePlus software can then be compatible.Speaking about the camera, front camera is terrible, it resembles front camera of smartphones like Oppo, Vivo. Sharpness is too high for the camera. Utter waste!Overall, I would suggest don't fall or get fooled for the OnePlus flagship because launching something for 26/28/30k only because you gained a lot of popularity is pathetic. There are many other good smartphones in the similar range that are performing pretty well than the Nord phone. OnePlus Nord has been a total disappointment and a poor purchase leading to wastage of money.

  mind blowing deviceMust go for this oneLove this grey onyxAmazing designCharging speed is very impressiveNo screen tint issueCamera quality is also very impressiveSound quality is greatPerformance is greatBest in this price range

  Fingerprint reader and the face unlock is really good, battery life is descent, when you start with a 100% you could play 3 to 4 hours of gaming and stil have a 60% balanceNow about the camera quality it's really nice if you compare it with others midrange phones but if you campare it with other OnePlus device then you will be disappointed still the main and ultrawide is really nice but the macro it not that good overall the camera system is niceThe performance is really nyc it's fast smooth and like OnePlus says the oxygen it breathes is really clean, gaming performance is too goodThe screen quality is best , that super amoled display with 90hz feels fast and feels premium.The build is really good Unless you try to break it like jerryrigeverything and this blue marble colour is soo good that even sky feels shame...

"

  All are good but I find battery issue in nordI have already used 1+ 5T,6T, no issues in that one day battery 20% balance of 3000mahIn nord 4115mah I feel it comes more than a day but it stands only for upto evening onlyFull day battery 0%üòå

  Small display issue is seen when we put Nuanced Dark theme on phone...that is quite disappointing.. Otherwise Nord Is Fabulous ü•∞

  1.fingerprint reads very fast as per our expectations2.battery life is not too much but it's good approx one day by net surfing or watching movies ..... Bt i think battery life doesn't matter because of its fast charging .... Nord charges vry fast  approx 50 min take to full charge and 10 min charge is for 30 Percent ,,,overall it's nice3.camera quality like a flagship level ..... especially main camera is excellent work and nightscape is awesomeOverall it's a perfect package phoneU could ask for everything

"
"

  I am die-hard fan of OnePlus owning 7 and now nord. always appreciated their sincere effort towards making their customer happy with quality products,but this time around the Quality has been compromised by OnePlus.the screen said to be 90Hz amoled doesn't feel like one. Ufs 3.1 should have been included.Camera is worse than ever. Macro camera is of no use, depth sensor too. Although weight is pretty much balanced. feels good while holding. OS is as cool as ever. Charger is quick. Decent phone, cost shuld have been atleast 3k less. Below OnePlus standards.

"
"

  Average phone from one plus..yes they have messed up a lot..the camera quality not so good this phone can't take a single moving photo. Makes blurry and camera is slow...speakers are good loud but no qaulity.. fingerprint reader slow ... sometimes fast sometimes does not read and after putting screen it sucks more..display qaulity is good but at this price range even other phones give better quality...OS is smooth but sometimes phone gets hang or restarts itself after having 12 gb ram and 256 gb storage really they made hype..and nothing interesting in this phone..if your going too take this phone for camera don't take it..if you just want to buy a simple average phone go for it. and their updates are just for names nothing changes..

"
"

  I have spent my three months of salary too but this phone and I am not satisfied now because I m broke but still I look at my phone and be happy the whole day even though i am hungry.Just kidding.....üôàüôàThe phone is a wow for the price. Display and performance is the best in the price segment with 765G processor. Finger print scanner works like a charm. Internet connectivity is superb with 4g. The only downside is the camera which is just good enough to get through the day.

"
"

  Ordered 3, not one. It's definitely worth the money. Super charging speed and display. I have been using Google phones all along. And this one is surely done a good job filling the shoes. Playing PUBG is smooth. The accessories are really good. OnePlus has made sure you do not need to visit ant store to buy screen guard and back cover.

"
"

  Screen lacks width. Finger print scanner needs a tap first before it's reads your finger-- irritating. My one plus 5 had a straight finger reader and must faster. Heats up a bit even in mormla long use.. I don't play any game.Screen size is not utilizes by default when using you tube. On zooming to full screen outer edges are cut of the video--- irritating.Best avoid.

  This is my First OnePlus mobile and I am writing this review after 3 days of use.Firstofall thanks to #amazon for fast delivery.The below review is for 12gb/256gb model1) Fingerprint and face unlocks works very quick2) camera quality is good but much when u zoom it to full capacity like it miss fineness3) battery life is good. I had charged to 100% and watched complete movie of 2 hrs online with hig quality resolution and 82% of charge was still remaining. But if you use for games then batter doesn't last long.4) charging is awesome it charged from 15% to 100% in just 52mins5) screen touch, 90hz refresh rate works superb6) no lagging was observed till now though I had played games like F1 race, will try Assault and post an update only if there was lagging.7) I like the zen mode a lot. As I get disturbed with phone often.8) Display resolution is excellent, I don't have much experience with other mobile screens but I really liked it's colours

"
"

  Before buying please read the return policy carefully. Both sides camera quality is very poor.Not matching with their nord advertisement.Amazon approach with their policy would have  done much better.

"
"

  Phone is great at its processing and never lagged while multitasking, 765g worth it. Camera quality is just awesome at this price range. I know there was some issue related to macro camera but thanks to OnePlus they never let their users to loose the faith in them...they fixed the macro camera issue with the update as usual. Battery life is at its best. Pre installed screen protector never lets you down, even gorilla glass 5 is hard enough to bear the accidental drops. Fingerprint sensor detects smoothly and speedily although no one can hate OnePlus fingerprint sensorsüòÄ. Headphone jack is missing but it's totally fine. Although i did deep excavation of this phone and found that there are some major issues related to camera quality like it blurs when captured picture is zoomed and also some problems with selfie camera such as 4k 60fps video recording takes efforts to open and power consumption of phone also have some general issues but hope so OnePlus will fix it with software updates.

"
"

  I have been using this phone since 2 weeks...I am in love with this phone completely.. I can say you wont find this kind of user experience in any other phone under 30K...765G + Oxygen OS is truly awesome...it's so smooth that you hardly face any issue..I can give 5/5 star to its display (Fluid Amoled + 90 hz) ‚úìCamera experience is better than what I had expected...I think back to back updates to fix the camera accuracy/issues worked...Battery performance is decent too.. what OnePlus had claimed during launch of this product its the same. It takes exactly one hour to fully charge this phone and with moderate usage it will last over a day...Cons:The only drawback in this phone is the speaker...it's not too loud. But with earphone/HP you will have an awesome experience..

"
"

  Excellent compatibility with the processor, high Effie in touch on both 60hz and 90hz. Battery consumption varies on the take being performed. I believe RAM utilization also plays a big role in bettery consumption. However, the phone has instant charging option wherin you will be able to plug in for 10 min and work for 5-6 hrs for very less usable inputs(again depends on usage). One in all, w great release. Hardware is intact! Camera is excellent. Look, feel and weight are to be appreciated.

"
"

  I have ordered this phone for my friend but after 10 days it started resetting the phone automatically. All the user data is lost it happens 3 to 4 times. Really disappointed by thisüò°üò°we cannot accept this from a brand like one plus. It's a flagship phone still I can't understand what going on. Really disappointed. Think once before buying this phone. May be the brand is in some kind of hurry so they don't take it seriously üò°üò° I have checked one plus website so many users facing this issue. It should be fixed soon. Overall phone is nice except this issue.

  Even though signal strength is full when others call  u they ll get ur mobile is switch offGetting this issue for Jio n/w usersTried different solution nothing working outThink before buying this mobile u ll definitely face network issue if use dual sims or Jio sim

  Review after 1 month.Cons:-1) Camera is not upto the mark, but Oneplus team is trying to resolve it by continuous Software Update.2) No stereo speaker.3) No 3.5mm headphone jack.Pros:-1) Very good display.2) Good Battery life, 9+hrs of Screen on time.3) Speaker has good sound even it has mono speaker.4) Camera is getting better.5) Fast Charging.6) Super of daily use, smooth performance.Others issues review:-1) No tint issue faced from starting.2) No bluetooth issue.3) JerryRig shows phone can be breakable with bare hand, but you are not JerryRig it is good phone not easily breakable instead of having plastic frame.

  Good phone. When I received the package, it was well packed. So, no issues in that. Coming to the phone, it is an awesome one. I went through a lot of reviews about this phone and most of which were negative and not encouraging. Though they scared me to purchase it, but I still wanted to buy it and I feel that I made the right decision. I did not find any issues with the phone. Everything about the phone is just good. üòÄ

  I was a big fan of oneplus and using one plus 6t from past 2 years. Was really excited and bought oneplus nord mobile for my wife. My excitement finished then and there. Phone doesn't look premium at all, looks very cheap and plastic. Biggest let down is the camera, it shoots like a 10 years back phone and selfies really suck.If you're thinking to buy please Invest 5000 more and take one plus 7t.It is a better buy that this.You have disappointed many oneplus with this product!

  I am One Plus user since 2016, and Bought this Phone after a Lot of reviews and a months wait.No reviewer, absolutely no one pointed out the very fact that with great power comes great responsibility.If you ask me features.. i cant say they are any less than expected. I am not fond of photography, neither of heavy gaming. But I do require heavy multitasking, good network, seamless performance in day to day basis, good battery and clean OS. But this phone has all of them. More than what you will ask. It houses the same modem that OP8/OP8 pro has, same camera Hardware as OP8, Almost similar OS. Special mention for network and data speeds. It has LTE Advanced with several additional capacities and absolutely flawless network.Screen on Time (4-5 hrs) Consistent and Charging is flawless. Battery drain is more during Hotspot or Mobile data.Charger doesn't heat the phone. but Processing doesBut only drawback is Snapdragon 765. It is by far highly weak for all of these.  It cant handle it for long and heats up too much. Even knowing this, the manufacturer has adopted different cooling systems like copper heat desiccator, on CPU, camera even at screen but of no help.I experienced heavy temperature up to  42-43 degrees on normal  usage and 45+ on 10 min video. Gaming also heats up equally. Even OP  customer care agrees 45 degrees damages CPU..Story of return... Something you should be aware ofI dint order return till 7th day. in all these 7 days I contacted Amazon CC and Oneplus CC. Followed their suggestions,  Wiping out Cache, Testing in Safe Mode, Factory Reset, etc. Followed min 20-max 80 % theory of battery chargingOn 7th day when I ordered return, I understood few conditions of 7 days return warranty. It saysItem received is physically damaged; (you should report in first 48 hrs)Item received has missing parts or accessories;Item received is different from their description on the product detail page on Amazon.in; orItem received is defective/does not work properly.Now its the last case for mine, but its highly subjective. Who will determine thisAmazon has a technician who will visit and inspect.Who are they, they are third party engaged by Amazon.the First visit fellow, from (TROUBLE SHOOTING).This fellow calls me at 11th hour (half hour before service needs to be completed as per schedule).He says he will come in few minutes and ask me some details.after few hours, i find My service is completed.What is the report?  my phone is working fine and no issues,That should make it non eligible for return.That is where Amazon comes to rescue. They listened to my issue and Arranged another senior technician.Also share that the only technicians report is not everything. By the time I already have temperature screen shots. I shared these with the second technician and he agrees to ""Item received is defective/does not work properly."".Thankfully my phone  return in picked up and money credited back. Thanks to amazon.and I ordered my other phone (off course not NORD) from amazon (!).So these are few words of caution.

  Received mobile even before sale started on AmazonSo one of the first customer to useThe phone touch is like butter and design is really goodI switched from OnePlus 5T to Nord ,so no issue in understanding the features.Oxygen is the beast UI in Mobile phonesPro's1.90Hz display-This you will understand the difference when to switch between apps, gaming and reading articles2. Fluid AMOLED display better than many phones in this range....compared with few Mobiles that my friends have.. OnePlus Nord is way better3. Battery life is just awesome.. even at 90Hz4. Design is very pleasing and elegant5. Camera- Rare Camera & Front both are good ...I don't use much still I think OnePlus must give update through which it can improve alot .6. Oxygen OS- Best in market & and best in class7. Warp charge is insanely fast wow....fast (30W)Con's (Mostly are expectations as a old OnePlus user)1. Side body being metal than bring plastic2. More colours, I like one which I have but would have being more delighted if could have got moon light black..Important Note:1.Many features such apps having dark themes,quick zoom to screen size, customize app icons, colour customizing and many more gives OnePlus mobile like Nord way more advantage than other mobiles in market even if they give bigger screen,better camera or battery2. Most important thing it will give to all Android updates for next 3 years....100% sure because I got started OnePlus 5T with Oreo (8.0) then I even got Android 10... So no other Android mobile company at present give this.#Oneplusnord#stayhome#staysafe

  Battery life is good not that awesome it take around 1hr 15min for full charge , performance wise it is smooth and fast to use but I am really sad with nord camera I found 3 problems in camera first portrait single person mode click black and white image second worst slo mo I have seen third micro lens is bad . I seen one or two problems more ...  When you watch hd or 4k content there is problem of auto brightness and issue of display ( green and pink tint ) when brightness is low. Anyway it is not a deal breaker but overall I will give 6.5/10

  Battery life: Drains very fast, heavy users will get only 6-7 hrs of battery backup also charges battery 100% in 1 hr.Display very goodSound above averagePerformance excellentIf you need good battery backup please go for another phone..  Nord battery Drains very fast really fast..

  Great product by 1+, this is my third phone of 1+ after 1+x and 1+5, Blue marble color is catchy. Battery life is good,, oxygen is best as always. Camera quality is very good,got an update for macro camera setting, nightscape camera is excellent, did not face any issue of tinting in low brightness. Processor is fast and full charging under 1 hr.All in all very good phone in the range

  HiAfter usage of more than 8 days, I'm writing this review.Pros1. Looks n feel is definitely premium2. Fresh feel of product3. Battery life is good with mild usage, will easily last a day.4. Fast processor5. Amazing capability of multi tasking6. Oneplus os is gr8Cons1. Camera is okay, but could have been better, depth in pics lack original colors  though day light photography is okay2. Back finish is gloss, tend to slip out of hands so back cover is must

  one plus nord lacks camera stability, takes few secs while capturing a photo if moved the photo becomes hazy, have to keep  the phone and object steady till the photo loads. havent seen such in budget phone as well. hopefully one plus can fix this with an update in future. one more problem is as the picture clicked from back camera has lot of saturation like realme hones it looks artificial.  front camera is worthless. i mean in atificial light where there is too much light above head example in big showrooms malls or big shops or supermarket where there is lots of light above you nord completely messes up the white balance i mean you can hardly see the background properly. even the colours come disortedi mean its not accurate. if you click a photo in such condition you will notice the face is filled with light and you can hardy use that photo. i dont know if this is happening in my phone or everyone's phone. only plus point in this phone is its haptic feedback and when you hold the phone it will fit you hand beautifully. no need to mention the oxygen os. fingerprint is average i think due to animation it looks slow. amoled displayis beautiful. charging speed is fabulous. i mean i recharged the battery in around 40 mins. backup is also average. overall its an average phone nothing extra ordinary in it. there are better phones at better price in market. hopefully one plus fixes the camera issue if so other problems can be managed

  Review after 3 months of usage. Pre-ordered the phone coz had a feeling that this was going to be that good.It has totally overcome the expectations in screen and performance. It gives everything that you'll need in a daily driver phone and some moreThese are the bad things that I noticed about this phone -1. Mono speaker(loud) but it's mono.2. Felt like battery was an issue but it's improving with software updates. Now it's nearly 7 hrs of SOT.3. Whoever thinks it's camera is bad, well they should just goto xda and try Google camera port for this. It's still bad(lol).4. Whoever is complaining about green tint are just looking for a reason not to buy this phone coz honest to god, it's not visible normally. You must really be looking for it and must have a nord phone with the defect to actually see it. My nord doesn't have( well I haven't seen it anyways).5. I know some people are fond of inbuilt phone recording in dialer. Sadly nord doesn't have it.Overall I think this phone is great. I'm not much of a camera person and therefore dont mind the ok-ok cameras on this. If you dont take too many photos and just wanna use this for daily use. Go for it. I bought it especially for 765 processor as it has inbuilt 5g modem( and because Google pixel 4a's display is 60Hz and just plain bad).

  Received it on 2 Aug 2020 ..Performance is very good ..Voice clarity is quiet good ..Device speaker is very good even at high volume with clear sound.CameraFront:  wide camera option is as good as described .Back camera : okBattery  : charging is quiet fast in half an hour my phone get charged from 10% to 80% ..With normal use .. such as WhatsApp and voice calling .. it can survive one day ..Overall a good handset in this range if you are looking for performance.

  The build of the phone looks very premium, however, surprisingly it is very lightweight. It is way lighter as compared to my Redmi K20. Hence, the Redmi K20 feels a bit sturdy on my hand. That doesn't imply that the Nord is not well built but the on hand feeling is well a bit disappointing to me.The cameras are kind of okay. The main camera is the one that will give you impressive pictures. The macro is too weak. Personally I'd have preferred a telephoto. Again let me compare with the K20. The primary camera of Nord is way better. The OIS will help you click better shots with the camera. The nightscape is impressive (better than what Redmi offers). Now if you can find the right GCam for Nord, I guess photography will be sorted. The Ultrawide camera will give you mixed feelings. Even I can't decide if the K20 is better or the Nord.Battery wise it lasts a day for me with regular usage. That's pretty good. Charging speed is pretty exciting!The 90hz screen is a pleasant affair but I am yet to experience its impact other than while swiping and scrolling.The fingerprint reader is I guess the best in class. It's fast and accurate. I have come to love it. I always favored hardware fingerprint reader after my experience with the K20, but Nord has me loving it.One thing I love is the software. I am a fan now. I preferred stock android over any other skin. But, maybe it is Oxygen OS that deserves to be the best. This is quite stock-ish. I used an Android One phone and then switched to this, and I feel like at home. With some renovations here and there.The rest of the hardware will cover you for a complete experience. I guess a metal frame is what could have made it better. Jerry did Bend it like Beckham.So if you are looking for great cameras, don't buy this. Honestly, the Realme X series will fare you better or wait for the Pixel. If you are just a casual clicker then the primary camera won't disappoint and the Nord does tick all other boxes. I think the experience of Oxygen OS should make up for what it lacks. And it's a mid ranger so don't expect flagship quality. It is pretty well balanced.

  Awesome camera and storage space

  I gotta say I was quite unsure on how my experience with a brand new OnePlus would turn out but damn this was the best choice I probably made. The feel, smoothness, customisation, performance is absolutely stunning, what made the experience even better was the fact that the device is seriously light weight better than all the other mobile experience I've had up until now. The GPU though Beast! I've tested it on the most heaviest game I've seen up till now though and I could not see a trace of stutter or any sort of lag. I used to find it in flagships lmao yeah Nord is that good!And yeah the camera experience is a little alright if you don't really care about it much but if you happen to be a camera freak then yeah this might be a hard choice. If you're a mid range gamer and sucker for fps and performance then yup this is the best device you can get your hands on! The battery life, yeah I haven't tested it much but I think it lasts about the same time it specifies in the battery optimization window, so there's really no issues there :>Make sure to get the best out of it by optimising to your specific requirements and enjoy ! I'm having a good time. Oh yeah and don't think twice before buying it just do it xD

  I bought the product under exchange policy. The phone was exchanged with one plus 3T. The exchange policy mentioned charger and other items not required while exchange. However I ended up exchanging the phone along with the charger. In addition to it, additional amount was paid for the exchange. I had waited for so long to get Nord, and was forced to pay the additional amount; else I had to return the product.Performance wise the phone is as good as other ONE Plus. A pocket friendly upgradation of the previous variants.However had to go through a bad experience with Amazon exchange policy.

"
"

  Very very bad camera my 1+6 give better photo than nord, because of the camera specification i bought nord and one plus dissappointed me with nord.  I thought 48 MP camera give good quality of picture and i really dissappointed. Dont bye if you look for camera otherwise the phone is good

"
"

  Just got it today. No display issues or heating issues as such. The battery will take 4-5 cycles to get to maximum capacity but I'm already getting good battery back up. The back of the phone gets slightly warm during the warp charging bit you won't notice it until you look for it.All in all, great phone. No issues during casual gaming as well. The processor is more than capable. Selfie camera and rear main camera are absolutely amazing. Just pretend the macro camera isn't there. üòãWill update with any issues if I face any.

  I am using my old mobile for long time of 2gb ram and looking for a perfect mobile and one plus launched nord iam using it from 9 days the 12gb variant and the performance is superb camera quality is also good but I have disappointed at one thing when iam stream prime the volume icon struck at its place and it interrupt so much at that time touch was not working when I close the aap the problem still continues i have restart my phone then it was clear from that place same problem occurs when I am playing pubg Hope it will fix in update

"

  ¬†Overall phone is goodFinger prinr is goodBettry life is good with 90Hz/ better with 69HzNo heating issuse found till nowOnly one problemCamera require some time to capture image and too much time in proocesingSome slow motion video , portrait selfie,night photos is given found good but it require too much times to proceess and save.

  Excellent spec, beautiful design, no major bloat ware, clean OS. Having dual SIM makes sense for a business and personal number. You'll get 8GB ram, 128Gb internal storage (20GB is taken up for the OS) & 5G although you won't get a 5G connection everywhere yet. The performance of the device is fast and smooth af.Regarding the display, thers's OLED distortion issues at extreme viewing angles, ie, slight shift in color and temperatures at oblique angles of screen. But its not visible with non white background and  NOT the ""green tint"" issue  that everyone is talking about.  Though it looks normal when looking at the screen head on, blue glare stripes are visible as you tilt at extreme angles of screen affecting whites of the phone(basically any app that supports a white background)One point to note, it warns when you put in  two sim cards, you are unable to connect to a 5G network until they release the software update. Having 5G makes the device future proof. No lag on phone and ticks all the boxes decent cameras and it will only get better with updates from 1+. Included is a phone case and screen protector. It's definitely a flagship killer.

"

  #1. The Color Gray Onyx perfect. OxygenOS which runs as smooth as they come.#2.  The quality of the sound as speaker in the bottom looks like an extra louder.#3. Plastic Design looks and feels similar to the metal that feels the premium phone.#4. Screen and refresh rate great as mentioned.#5. Battery last long full use in Game & Multi-tasking.#6. As a Gamer, it's good and perfect for mid gaming phone as we with the processor.The Perfect Budget Phone with the Camera, Processor, and Premium feel compare to other brands with the same features and price range.

"
"

  Absolute value for money, considering the features that it provides. Definitely the the second best of everything, although I would rate the screen performance first class. After the first two updates, camera and power backup just got a lot better. There is ample RAM and processing power for your daily mobile chores including playing COD. Except for the oxygen wrappers and couple of oneplus apps, the OS is pretty much clean and neat.Still not sure why people bother to spend more than half a lakh of Indian monies for a similar phone with a logo of a bitten apple behind it :PDownsides -> I really miss the 3.5mm jack :( . They could also have included a telephoto camera instead of that second front facing camera (Just absolute waste).

  It's a excellent phone , It's definitely a allrounder with gud price , everything is fine , battery life is gud..7hr to 8hr screen on time if you use normally like insta fb Twitter Play games for few hours . Camera main sensor is excellent and also wide angle sensor is decent, macro is okay. Front cam photo is gud and video is excellent. Screen is excellent amoled with 90hz and UI is excellent with already 4 updates came till now. OnePlus always known for fast updates and Oxygen UI.Performance is fine even PUBG and call of duty running smoothly. OnePlus will also give update for PUBG high ultra settings. No color tint issue with mine I have tried in dark condition check many times.No phone is giving this much of specs with price. Truly value for money comparing from European and US markets it's cheaper by 10k to 12k.Cons -Not a big battery but it's fine if you are not a heavy gamer ,plus fast charging is there it's handy.Macro cam - It's macro cam average ,it's not gud but they gave two updates for macro.Depth cam - It's also averageSlow Mo - No 480f/s

  Not for gamers !! Please Go for 128GB or more BUT NOT FOR 64GB PleasePros:1. Performance is very very Fast2. Screen looks Fab - bright colors with great refresh rate 90hrz3. OXygen UI u will fall in love with this !!4. Looks Premium except the plastic on the sides, well can ignore if u have a great phone case!!5. Fast Charging 30 Watt WARP - half an hour full charge  (0-100%)6. Camera - ultra wide and 8 mp are the cams for this rest are dummy7. selfie camera are okay8. Mono audio is good feels no diff from stereo though9. 5G Mobile man go for itCons:1. Camera depth Field & Macro are just for show case (Got Fooled)2. Battery drains faster with continuos usage (morning till 7 30 pm) nothing to worry as it recharged in half an hour to 100%3. No 3.5mm Jack this is a big dropback (either buy wireless headphones or Type C to 3.5mm converter)4. No Expandable slotFinally go for it if u are not much of a gamer, its worth buying for this Price !! remember 5G 765 Processor

"

  Yes, got both the versions!Giving a review after 3 days of use when I finally had to charge the phones again.- Used for HD online game: lag free experience and impressive battery back up even after considering these to be new phones.- Great overall built and looks, more than value for money.- Quite an impressive camera but the 4-camera set up was unnecessary other than keeping up with the market demands.- The inbox phone case is a simple one but not too great a protection for the camera bump.- A few apps come pre-installed and might be unnecessary.The last 2 points may be considered a time-waster but not my fault, could barely find a legit ground to complain. Haha!Please keep in mind this is not a flagship phone but to cater to mid tier needs, for which OnePlus Nord supersedes though!

"
"

  Within 2 weeks from the date of purchase My phone is getting rebooted automatically.This has happened couple of time now and I'm receiving phone call and unable to attend the calls as the phone gets hanged some times.Battery Life is also unsatisfactory.Purely its based on luck that if you get a good piece of product you can enjoy, otherwise you may have to die like me.Return policy is valid only for a week. All the problems starts only after a week of time and you have to run between service center and home.

"
"

  Speed is goodRear camera is goodWhen it comes to battery life it doesn't last for a 12hrsAnd worst part of the phone is front camera not upto the mark @oneplus

"
"

  1) If you are looking for a premium phone , OnePlus Nord is not an option for you.2) Phone gives feeling of OPPO or VIVO phone for which you need not to pay 28k or 30K.3) Fast charging is good, Camera of fine (not extraordinary)4) Display is good.5) Heating problem still persist in oneplus devices.

"
"

  On screen fingerprint reader is really slow than back side fingerprint reader, some times finger print is not detected at all. Face unlock super fast, works really good even in complete darkness.. Battery not an issue for me as i don't play any games (lasts for a day).. Camera quite good.. Google Chrome has an issue..sometimes search results doesn't show up.. Have to back and search again otherwise phone is running smooth

"
"

  There is a green tint on screen of the phone. There ie a bar on the camera notch.The bix came in crumbled from all sides. Heavily disappointed in this phone. Please Do Not Buy

"
"

  Received a dud phone which refused to start. Which was quite shocking given Oneplus brand. One top of it, the phone is unavailable now, and wrt to refund, Amazon pickup person wants to start the phone before picking up (which will not start as the phone is defective), so overall pretty I m stuck with a phone which is a paperweight, waiting for Amazon to resolve it. Very disappointed with Oneplus though.

"
"

  The phone has some serious flaws.1. Bluetooth connectivity issues (which is terrible as the phone doesn't have a 3.5mm jack). I cannot use a headset for any call, it just disconnects till the call is over, cannot reconnect. Listening to music is jumpy and the headset disconnects and reconnects frequently2. Aside from that, there are notification issues (clicking on notifications does nothing).3. Lastly, at bit of lag in certain applications, which I never had for same apps in my older phone, the OP 5T.

"
"

  Display problem, one Plus fails to address the obvious hardware issue and is just trying to fool the customers i should have rather bought pixel 4a check the tint it doesn't stop in grey background trust me it is very much noticable as a red hue on white screens too in the night. I feel that iff i use it in the night my eyes will get spoilt because the red hue is very annoying. Disappointed by one plus, didn't expect cheap product like this.Can adjust on anything other than display.

"
"

  Great battery life, easily lasts over a day with normal use. Great screen, under any lighting conditions. OxygenOS is nice and clean and offers a few extra features that are pretty cool. Fingerprint scanner under screen works very well. This is the best phone you can buy for this price, with 12/256 Gb options. If you use dual sims, and are looking for a daily driver, this phone is a great option.Camera is just okay, it's not bad but it's not great. But you wouldn't be buying this phone for the camera anyway.

  The review is after 7 days of use..Well from the last few years I have been dreaming of taking one plus finally nord is here after 3 attempt online..So much hype in this year.Finally got the 12+256Gb variant .Here is some review of every segment1.Ease of use -Well oxygen os is something which is so smooth , always wanted to have its experience finally it's here..The os is so smooth and crisp..with 90 hz refresh rate you can literally run so many apps in background.It is getting updates every week so get ready for android 11 by year end.2.performance - As I have told earlier is is smooth and hardly you feel any lag.One thing surprise me is the Google keep application if you set in desktop and try to use the writing feature the phone response to it very late..3.Battery life - I am hardcore user.I used it as BYOD at my work..all the office apps from Microsoft is there, So many calls in whole day, Battery depending on your usage, I have screen time of 5-6 hours daily, the best thing is Wrap charging its the best hardly took 45-50 mins to get charged ..In the beginning it will take sometime to collaborate with screen ,daily use after 3-4 days you will have the stable battery life so don't get upet if it's drain quickly in first or 2nd day..4.gaming - Well pubg is banned but I have played some other games.. Experience is good.it also has that fnactic mode which disrupts background activities and notification it's good thing to see.5. Camera-Well I would rate 3.5 out of 5.you are paying 28-30 k but will expect something good..the macro camera is uselss and hope it will improve as per updates..front facing camera is good...The wide angle camra is lacking detail..Nightscape is good and portrait is good ..I will udpate as per usage in upcoming week or month..

  Onepluse Nord (12+256)ProsPerformance: 765G has its own sustainability rate. So in performance it gives you the powerful CPU in mid-range phones. Gaming is something the OnePlus Nord can handle fairly well, in terms of performance. Popular games like PUBG Mobile and COD: Mobile run at 100% stabilityCamera: it comes with the quad camera setup 48+8+5+2 and in front it has 32+8. Wide angle range is 119¬∞ for rear camera while wide angle range is 105¬∞ wide. It supports features such as HDR, It gives you a video of 4K@30/60fps, 1080p@30/60fps, it offers amazing selfies, the quality of the produced photos is very good in both natural & low light conditions, the images, videos & text look very sharp & clear, It is attractive & fashionable.(Also check the cons)Wrap charging: OnePlus has given what they promised. Wrap charging of 30T support provides 0 to 100% within 40 mins. Seems like last long day.Built:There's Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back which makes your phone scratch proof. It has plastic frame considering low cost it's fine to have it.Speaker: There is only one speaker under OnePlus Nord. It is not ideal for videos or games, but it becomes reasonably loud and sounds good.Red club membership: It will provide you 50GB of cloud storage. Also with several benefits.Cons:Battery: 4115 mAh battery provides less backup while you are gaming. Drains quickly. But if you are not a gaming person it lasts for a day with normal use.Camera: It has quad camera setup but Micro lens of 2MP has no use. If you are a pro photographer you better know how to click micro photograph.Headphone jack: Maybe you can call it as business strategy OnePlus Nord doesn't have 3.5 mm headphone jack. So one has to buy Bluetooth earphones or ear buds. (Simultaneously launch oneplus buds and promoted)Expandable memory slot: unavailability of expandable memory slot might give you problem later after few years of use. Considering memory storage.5G: OnePlus Nord is a future ready phone with 5G setup but it allows 5G+4G sim only one 5G sim could be used at a time.In the end If you are a fan of OnePlus and love to have good performance phone with mid-range you better chose this. It's promising. üëç

  I loved the display. It's big and super clear and viewing angles are phenomenol. Coming from Pixel 2, I wanted a phone that has stock android or near stock android UI as I hate bloatware or ads and I need regular updates. Thankfully, there are none. Fingerprint reader is superfast. I agree with many ppl on the pros they mentioned. A few things that I didn't like about this phone are:1. Android auto not working. After connecting phone to my car using cable, I see android auto screen on my cars gets flickering for sometime and then lost connection. You can check on this issue in oneplus community as well.2. Time will stay unchanged until you focus on the screen. Even clock app gets updated time after a fration of second. This happens when night mode on as well. When you take out your phone during the night, it will be very bright. Once you unlock, them only it will become dim.3. Edge round cutouts on screen will partially hide content on some applications.4. Google play update fails every time.5. Camera not upto the mark. Expected for a person coming from Pixel device.6. Hardware buttons are protruding on the sides and they are sensitive and can easily be clicked unintentionally. I took many screenshots without realising. I locked the screen many times as well. Buttons could've been little hard.7. As geekyranjit mentioned in one of his videos that auto brightness sensor calibration could be better. There are a lot times I manually had to increase the brightness.Overall, it's great value for money phone. It feels premium in your hand.

  The mistake of my life that I gifted it to my mom. It restarts automatically in couple of days and shows the bootloader to my mom. She is not an Android developer so she ends up formatting every time (thank god she has a backup phone and knows how to switch sim). I asked the customer care and the best solution they had was to take phone to a service center, which is not possible due to all COVID situation and the nearest center is far far away.Don‚Äôt buy one plus unless you understand bootloaders on Android devices. Why will you want to go through that pain. Never for your parents. Other than this everything else on the phone is ok.

  Its been more than a month, I am using this phone. And I was one of the happy OnePlus user but last week we have got an update and after the installing the updates, there is very serious network issue.Sometimes, it feels like throwing the phone away my new phone as suddenly you cannot call anyone and your net also stops working.I have written below mail to OnePlus lets see till when we get an update. Until then I dont know how am I going to manage.Hi OnePlus Team,There are a couple of issue that I am facing since the last update, please note these problems were not there before the last update took place.1. Whenever I call anyone, there is a full signal and suddenly after a while it runs out of network and shows an error. Also when on international calls it gets disconnected very often. There is no error in sim card as it works well in other device.2. Even in full network, showing 4G above the network I face loading error. Not only on Google but any app, even on whatsapp it is not able to send a hi and I have to reboot the phone to get it working again.I request you to find a solution to this as OnePlus is a very trusted brand and we as consumers do not expect such major problems from you device.

"
"

  Worst phone ever....please dont go for this phone this is really the worst phone ...battery drains bery fast not even last for 4-5 hours. And if you play 3-4 games of pubg it will come to 10 from 100 in just 3-4 games ....and camera is the worst..specially the front camera in low light it showing pictures you are clicking from a keypad phone.... And noramlly if you click there is soo much of noise...please avoid buying this phone

"
"

  There is huge unkown strage network issue on oneplus nord. While internet works on browser but have network issue on few apps. I could not play free fire and pubg due to network issue. But when i connected to wifi i was able to play these game.  I tried changing sims, resetting wiffi and internet setting,i even factory reset the phone but nothing works. Either oneplus should explain this strange network issue and come with a solution or everyone should get a refund or replacement.

"
"

  This phone has a serious Bluetooth connectivity issue. Bluetooth device automatically disconnects and doesn't connects again. Since it is not equipped with a 3.5 mm jack it makes the situation worse.Oneplus community forum is stacked up with this complaint.Do it 100 times before buying it.

"
"

  I bought this phone with loads of good hopes, but it disappointed me very hugely. I am experiencing flickers while scrolling many apps like Google, slo motion videos, gallery and every apps.My expectations shattered since I came to know that I have to run 30 kms to service center for this problem. I have to go leaving my work to service center and donot know when I will get my phone back.Seriously Disappointed with One Plus!!!Will not recommend this phone to anyone!!!

"
"

  first of al i will thanks amazon for shipping it really earlyTalking about the phone the phone is really good at what it gives .If u expect a lot from this phone then think again coz it is a mid range phone so it wont give u the flagship feel but yes it has some premiuimness to it .Talking about the screen it is top level . The 90hz screen is really smooth n gives vivid colurs to the screenThe battry life is also really good and fast charging thanks to the 30 warp chargerThe performance is crisp for a day to day user .Even if u a hard user this phone wont let u down THE GAMING EXPERIENCE WAS ALSO REALLY GOOD  I DIDNT FELT ANY LAG playing pubgthe camera is also good but the best i would say but the video quality is really nice and also the front camera is niceit look really good i have the grey colour and it looks really niceoverall this phone is a complete package with a branding of oneplusi woukd say just go for this phone if u want good performance nice camera really good battery backup and even storage and of a such a goodbrand like oneplusi think u shoukd go for iti m happy with this phone

  Phone is superb in quality and every aspects except camera in low light conditions I have been using this phone since one week playing pubg daily for about 5 hours there is no heating issue fingerprint reader is very accurate good battery life tested playing pubg below 15 percentage I could play 4 livik maps no tint issue observed while usage if you are heavy gamer my suggestion is no if your average user I woul higly recommend this phone I would rate 4 stars reduced one star for camera quality oxygen is superb in usage very smooth.

"
"

  Initially there were few issues with the phone, mainly Bluetooth connection stability. But a recent software update has resolved the issue. Battery life is decent for gamers, finger print scanner works as advertised, camera quality has been improved but slow motion feature no longer gives an option to choose resolution and frame rate like before.

"
"

  ¬†I'm writing this review after using the smartphone for around two months as my daily driver.Cons :1. Display tint issue still persists and OnePlus didn't address this properly.2. Even though Rear camera shutter speed is normal, image processing takes a lot of time which ends up with blurry photos.3. I'm facing lag issues when scrolling down the news feed, transition strangely is not that smooth on 90hz refresh rate compared to the built in  app usage.4. Few push notifications strangely aren't alerted to the user when the phone is on idle. Seems like a software glitch even though changes in the settings are done.5. In call speaker grill area tends to heat while on the voice call for more time.Pros :1. Stock Android no nonsense experience is fantastic, I'm afraid of the experience post Oxygen OS11 update.2. Haptic feedback is a small feature but very effective.3. I usually get SOT of 5-7 hours based on the usage, charging time is quick too 10-100 in 40 minutes under room temperature and normal phone temperature.4. In hand feel is very solid, thanks to weight management accross the phone.5. Signal reception is Good and in call speaker quality is crisp and clear.6. In the daylight, 48mp rear shooter takes stunning photos. Slow Mo and 1080 60fps videos recorded are super smooth courtesy, optical image stabilization.After the latest software update 10.5.8,Battery backup has significantly improved, on the other hand signal reception has taken a hit with some signal drops.

  Fingerprint reader is lil bit slow compared to my old phone vivo V7, which instantly detects n unlocks but this is not the same with one plus NordBattery life is also not upto the markNo doubt it charges quickly but it quickly  drains tooContinuous usage of 2-3hrs heats up the phone slightlyCamera quality is good specially ultra wide modeOnly 2 camera's of rear one's are working other 2 are just extra with no useSo basically they promise for 4 camera's n gives only 2Front LED screen flash is ok ok typeNot able to see in dark before clicking what exactly u r clicking..N also it's takes much time to process images, u have to remain steady for about 2-3 seconds after u captureI mean it should capture n process instantly but it takes much time to process the imageI miss notification blinker which was very helpful to meThey should have added but it's not there so unless u unlock ur phone u don't know u have received a notification or notM using this phone since 1 week n All I can say for now is evertym I m comparing it with my old phone vivo V7 i found V7 better than this.. only it has ultra wide mode which was not there with vivo

  I got my hands on this product on 13 August. At the beginning finger print senson was bad, camera was good and battery life optimization was bad as one morning I saw this phone just died overnight and only 1% was remaining but with updates today finger print sensor is not of much use face detection does a phenomenal job, even camera has started to improve not that anytime it was bad but just getting more better. Battery life has also improved with updates.

"
"

  Here is my review about this mobile after using it for a week.Simply it's a nice mobile with all features that we expect from one plusOnly 2 negative points battery drain fast on normal uses it will run for a day.And you cannot play full screen videos on Amazon prime Netflix etc.Rest it's really nice phone. Go for it.

"
"

  It's been only 15 days and the screen showing blue spots.  Replacement date also gone.  These kind of manufacturing defects and low quality was not expected from oneplus. Quality has dropped exponentially.

"

  Battery life is very bad , serious buyer go for other brand /another one plus model just like 7T ...8..

  It's my first OnePlus phone.It is very good.. but every phone will have some good and bad things..let us discussPros:-1)it's display quality is amazing and colours are vibrant...just when you experiencing such quality you wil defenetly impressed...it's display better than samsung phones(compared with A50)2) battery somewhat good.They providing 30Watt fast charger with in the box.It's a good thing.It is full charged approx 55min.3) oxygen os...  It's super.. didn't experience any lags while  using. Finger print scanner is fast and accurate.4)camera is super.great resolution pics are coming.5)even it is monospeaker it is loud than realme samsung phones.i am surprised.sound is descent.don't worry about sound.it's output is goodCons:-1)Battery somewhat draining fast.It will come below 10 percent if you use high brightness and high refresh rate by evening.if you on battery saver mode it will come till night.2)macro lens are waste.pics are not coming with high resolution.better to use main camera for macro shots alsoüòå.3)there is a bug.if you go to settings for enable full display for Amazon and some apps,there are showing no apps.may be it will fix via update.Overall it's good for medium gamers and best for good performance..Defenetly you can use this phone for 3 years..Another thing is that I didn't observe any tint issue.But prize somehow it's little bit high.it is better to bring base model at 128+6,8+256,12+256Anyway I am satisfied with this device

  Mic was not working properly not even its call recording. I request for return but i was forced to get a replacement and now replacement is getting delayed. Lastly I am now stuck with faulty piece waiting for replacement. I have never had such a bad experience with Amazon.

"
"

  ProsValue for money. I availed the Amazon exchange program as well. Hats off to oneplus for engineering this product. The 90hz panel is the best feature of the phone. The 765g does not feel slow at all. I have the 12g ram variant. Build quality is very good even though the frame is plastic. The marble blue color is beautiful. The stock android experience is really cool.ConsA little disappointed with the camera package. Though there are 5 to 6 of them, I feel they should have cut down on the numbers and focused on improving the wide angle lens and overall image processing.

  If your are old Oneplus user you will be disappointed. I am sharing my view based on comparing my old Oneplus 5TIf you consider Camera this is not worth the upgrade from Oneplus 5, 5T, 6, and 6T Camera. (Take a pic with trees or plants in the background and compare)Sound (Speaker) is averageBattery life is same as Oneplus 5TOnly good think is display is smooth.Processor is slow compare to Oneplus 5T. Takes time to click and process the images initially is shows pixels in-the images after sometimes it loads.Apps repose is slow (Instagram, Olx, Facebook.)Network (JIO) Is not up-to the markIf you downloading something and try to use other apps its takes time to respondEven with the full network coverage Browser goes offline.Only with the Hype by saying 5G ready and Lesser availability there are marketing this phone.5G is minimum 1.5 yrs away think before buying this phone

  The phone is good overall. No performance issues whatsoever (it has beefed up specs, so yeah) and the good old Oxygen OS is snappy as ever. The display is good too (colors pop). The main camera (back camera) is great. It has a lot of detail, handles dynamic range well and the photos come out good (albeit a tad bit on the brighter side). The wide angle camera is okay at best. The macro, meh. The selfie camera is fine too (but struggles heavily under low light).Overall a good phone, with a good main camera (others are just ok)

  CONS:- Biggest con is software. There are lots of glitches. This phone feels like it was done very hastily in the last moment due to deadlines. They are pushing stability updates, but not fast enough.MAJOR BLUETOOTH BUG : I have 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi at home.. So whenever I am connected to Wi-Fi and connect my Bluetooth earphones and switch a few apps, earphones will disconnect and refuse to reconnect. This is really annoying since phone doesn't have any earphone jack either. They have pushed few updates to fix this but problem still exists (though slightly better stability now. My oxygen os version is 10.5.7)  I will update my review when it gets completely fixed.- Macro Camera and Software beatification : Even with beatification off, it tends to smoothen and whiten skin quite often (Can be easily fixed with google camera though). Macro camera is useless but we already knew that :P .- Battery drain is quite fast. Playing 30 mins COD (high settings) will drain your battery by almost 20 percent.  Call and camera also consumes lots of battery.PROS :- First of all, this is a pretty decent phone with a very well rounded performance. It runs anything you throw at it with relative ease... All games run with max frame rates at medium settings and moderate frame rates at high settings.- Display is one of the best you can get. Extremely smooth and vibrant.- Camera is very good. Trust me on this one. The hardware is fantastic. If you don't like the beatifications just use google camera. (And of course, ignore macro camera... it's just to increase numbers). But normal photos turn out excellent. If you are a decent photographer, you can easily take phots of comparable to that of iPhone 11.- Charging is really fast. (But kind of useless since draining is also really fast :P)VERDICTStay away till Bluetooth issue is completely fixed... the Bluetooth disconnection makes your experience terrible and frustrating. Even if you don't have 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi at home, most public place Wi-Fi are of this type only.

  One plus Nord is not worth even  Rs.15000/- .After setting up the mobile, it was found that Power button is not working & mobile is not switching off. The display is becoming dim on its own & phone is heating up like hot cake & draining the bettery quickly.

"
"

  It's a good phone having pros and cons equally. Camera is good except the macro cam which is completely worst and of no use even after 1-2 updates it's still the same. So if you put a black tape on the macro camera lens it will be better üòÜ, at least you don't have to see it then and regret.Next thing is display, which is awesome for me as it's my first Amoled display phone. Watching Netflix, Amazon Prime on this device is an awesome experience.Battery is decent as it has to be for a 4100mAh. Charging speed is something that I'm in love with. I have to keep an eye while charging it as I don't like to keep it unattended while the battery's become fully charged. So it's super fast charging.There is no heating issue till now but can't say anything about Gaming (pubg etc) as I don't play games on mobile.Bedtime mode which greys the screen sometimes doesn't work üßêand I have to off it and then again on it then it starts working.Now the most important thing, tint issue and black bar. I think it's completely negligible in my device especially Tint, but there's a black strip in the line of front camera but its okay and not a big issue as shown by many YouTube reviewers especially those who doesn't get the reviewer unitüòÜ.Video is something which I can say is AWESOME. Even if there is only one subject it is capable of Bokeh video shooting. 4k 60fps is mind boggling.At last waiting for the update when Macro can be actually give performance like a macro camera which is looking like an impossible task in near future.Plastic frame is a bit disappointing but with a case(other than the transparent case as it will turn yellowish in 1-2 months) one can prevent scratches.Overall it's a good phone and the hype created is somehow justifies the product but not totally so.

  Display - 90hz as usual smooth and amazing.Camera - Main camera not bad but got a system update for improved camera quality.Battery - As usual warp charge one plus best feature 70% - 30mins.Performance - Blazingly fast performance  no performance issues and added advantage fnactic mode for gaming purposes.

"
"

  This is really not as per oneplus standards.1. The phone restarts randomly every now and then.2. The network coverage is very bad. Often people tell me your phone is not reachable but when i see the network bar it shows no issue.3. Problem with jio network. In my area jio coverage is very good but this phone often shows no jio network. I need keep switching flight mode to regain the network.These r two main issue with the phone and no body is writing about it. (Network and restarting)

"
"

  Product is good but battery drain is so fast even i did n't use any apps in the background. Except battery the overall performance is good.The phone feels handy it can be fit in your hand perfectly I like this very much.No adds it feels I am safe to use the internet and apps . Out of 5 I can provide 4.2 rating.I got an os update and then the battery draining slowly thought that one plus team efforts about the battery issues

"
"

  Display is OK doesnt look like a amoled display. Samsung m31 has far better display at low price. Nord is quick. Sound system is bad sound explodes it feels. Doesn't look like 90 hz either. Feels like a cheap quality one plus phone. Samsung m31 is far far better than this.

  Moved on from redmi note 4 itself a big upgrade.Game: A little bit heats up while playing pubg. Am a light Gamer, hardly spend 1 hr. Heats up. After closing the game it will become normal.Fingerprint sensor: perfectly ok,but my right thumb work perfectly..but left thumb sometimes hit or miss even though my left thumb got two fp stored.Camera: It's good only. Processing takes time. Asusual two back and two front are good. No wrds any other two in back. Front gives you raw image in selfies. Low light need improvement. Overall Okayish. Not perfectPerformance: Top notch. Happy with it.Display: I just love it.Audio: goodBattery:  This is where I am disappointed sometimes. Needs optimization. 60hz seems to consume more battery hardly 5 hrs.UI: missed small small requirements. Like haptic feedback when someone attend the call, it will be helpful for many. Can't able to see daily data usage, small improvement. All will say this OS is good bla bla bla. Yeah it's minimal, Especially I am moving on from MIUI. That's y I am missing such things I used to, which is a basic requirements only. Out of 10 I will give 7...... Because of battery and processing speed of camera and need small improvement on OS

"
"

  Writing the review after using this phone for a month. Overall performance is really good. Almost the premium level experience in mid range price range. Fingerprint reader is superfast with a failure rate of 2 out of 50. Camera quality is kind of okay but not outstanding. Even though justifiable within this price range. Battery life is just met expectation with a day backup for mixed usage. The 90Hz refresh rate is tremendously using battery. OS experience is what I felt premium feel all this time. In design OnePlus tried their best to meet the expectations.

"
"

  Just received it.....and the phone is fantastic cum satisfactory ..iam not saying that it's not good I must say its awesome in some of its unique aspects ....Only thing is it's macro lens -useless lens with bad quality ..but Main camera isQuite nice needs some updates..but overall amazing ..selfies are the main attraction...Oxygen OS is love and battery is quite good... In this price range it's not bad and gaming is also quite nice ...Full review after 1 months usage ..okay then enjoy your nord !

"
"

  One plus if you are hearing me this time I felt cheated because the camera hype was so much that it will be very good camera and just because of camera and one plus branding I purchased this phone and totally disappointed I am looking forward to replace it as soon as possible till I will wait for any updates regarding camera if they can do it before 27 August iw I'll be happy to keep this phone or I will replace

"
"

  Overall satisfied...I am not facing any issues like tint issue an be the Bluetooth connectivity issue. √ç have been using this device since the 5 th of August and i am happy to say that Nord is definitely the value for money smartphone you are looking for.... The negative reviews are basically simply degrading the hyped ONEPLUS Nord.... I hope you guys would like the phone..  I feel its camera is not the best at this price segment

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.PROSSuper display { fluid amoled }Fast charger / battery backupDesign, weight, thicknessOverall good performanceCONS plastic framingMacro and depth no use worst cameraNo headphone jackWhile in dark mode you can face some colour issues in Google crome.If you are a gamer or like to get the best performance just go for realme x3 or redmi k20If you are a overall medium user you can go for it.

"
"

  This is the best phone one can buy within a budget of 30k. I was pretty much confused at first, as there were many negative reviews about the nord, but finally I decided to buy the 12gb variant.And all I can say is it's completely worth it as i wanted a phone for multimedia purpose which requires good camera, good resolution in display, smooth performance. The nord completely meets my expectation.Battery could have been a lil bit better but also don't forget that the device runs in a 90hz refreshing rate which can be reduced to 60hz as well for longer lasting of the battery and the warp charger is great too, charges from 0-100 in around 70mins, which is quite good i suppose.People saying it's a over-hyped phone, it ain't, other brands are jealous of oneplus the way they are capturing the market!Go for it without a second thought, you won't regret.

"
"

  The camera quality of the product is pethetic not even compete with 10000 phone in the market....don't purchase you will definitely regret about this.... Now both amozon and one plus answer ing my calls...not even able to return....

"
"

  Best phone in this Segment, Don't go with the negatives comment as they want everything in a 30k device, Camera is Upto Mark,  The 48 Mp. Main Camera does a pretty decent job and The main Oxygen Os for what people buy it for you'll love it. Go for it. It looks Premium.

"
"

  One Plus Nord tag line is true that, they have ""stolen the 48 MP camera from One plus 8"" If they would have bought from Sony and worked on camera software, Images taken from One Plus Nord could have been better as compared to other low budget Vivo / Oppo / Realme models (While all brands - Oppo/Vivo/Realme/One Plus/IQOO belongs to BBK Electronics, China)Battery is not upto the mark and full charge goes upto 8-12 hours on moderate or low usage. My 2 year old Honor view 10 gives more battery power then One Plus Nord.

"
"

  Dear All,I have been using this phone since 3 days with a very heavy usage. Here are some pros and cons :Pros1) Excellent display which is super amoled2) Refresh Rate 90 hz it's simply wonderful the way phone response to your fast typing.3) Battery is pretty decent even with a heavy and continuous usage like calls, music and 2 movies it last for 16 hours easily and it gets charged easily from 0 to 100 in 60 minutes which is pretty good.4) Finger print unlock and heptic feedback is next level.5) Sleek design looks stylish and one handed use is easily possible.6 And last but not the least one plus user experience is really awesome where you get to a lot of R&D with your phone where you can customise it as per your personality.7) Video quality is also very good, you can make really good videos.Cons :Just one why one plus why can't you get your camera straight where colors are punchy and pictures are sharper. Trust me if you do this you might be in direct competition with Apple.

"
"

  Reviewing after 2 week of usesPhone is running buttery smooth and I haven't face any problem.2 Things I like to mention-Battery backup can be much better.-Their is no problem with camera(hardware) but the problem is with the image processing (software).When you shoot in RAW and then post process(LR or Snapseed) it then you get best out of camera.Nothing is perfect in the world go ahead and buy it. A good value for money phone at this segment.

  My First One plus Smartphone loved this smartphone.One plus Nord Specifications:90HZ Amoled Display8GB Ram128GB Internal Storage48+8+5+2 MP Rear camera32+8MP Front CameraSnapdragon 765G Processor5G ReadyDual sim (5G + 4G)Fingerprint reader is as fast as face unlock both the security parameters are quick and fast.Camera Quality is also good amazing picture quality it enhance picture quality as it comes with 48MP Main Camera 8MP Wide angle 5MP Macro and 2 MP Depth camera. Love nord's camera Quality.Good processor Snapdragon 765G That helps for good gaming ExperienceOverall device performance is good loved this smartphone

"
"

  Before this phone, i have used Redmi Note and that UI and features are far better than Nord model. Battery life is not at all good. The battery drains faster even in idle state.  Speaker quality is not up to the mark. Don't go with this model because of the brand name alone.

"
"

  OnePlus phones are always awsmüëåüèªI've read many of the reviews that the camera quality is not that good but in my case I love the picture quality and ofcourse the front camera is also awsm..Battery life is also very good, if you charge it once you can use it for the whole day..Just go for it without any doubt n I just love this phone ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"
"

  Seeing Few negative reviews I was worried about the phone . But trust me guys it's amazing phone. You just need to know how to take pictures . Few are saying camera is not as expected but it has got good camera , smooth functioning n also new update also . So I would recommend people to buy this product . even the video quality is good. As I'm a YouTuber , I feel happy about the phone camera ,display, light and sound too.

"
"

  *Design is super awesome*Handy smartphone*90hz display is super smooth and colors are vibrant*Camera is great in all modes*4k 60 fps front camera is just wow*Wrap charge do its job*Very simple and clean phone thanks to OxygenOs*Battery life is also good

"
"

  I got the phone some days back and I have mixed opinions about this. First of all the camera is not that great. You can get phones with much better cameras at this price range. Noticed frequent lags between pictures and the camera takes its own sweet time to process/enhance photos. The front camera does beautification of photos in artificial light which is a let down. Low light performance is bad (I am seeing this blue blur in the pictures clicked at night with artificial light and have complained regarding the same.) The side panel is fragile and prone to scratches. The fingerprint scanner is decent. I am not much of a heavy phone user but yes the battery drains out fairly quickly. The only saving grace is the Oxygen OS and hence a smooth normal user experience. I had Poco F1 earlier and now this and I won't even call it an upgrade. Its an overhyped phone. Not much value for money. Plus you got to invest extra for phone accessories!Maybe updates would solve some of these issues in future.

  Writing review after 2 week of use. I was very skeptical about buying it and also after buying it, I was thinking of returning it. The main reason being that in display, white appears little yellowish in every screen settings.But after using it, I found more pros than cons:1)Display is awesome. Colours come out real goods.2)Phone feels good too in hands but not better than MI A1.3)Camera is not bad, camera app is. Google Cam give far better results in the lower resolution settings (with the same camera). Although nightscape is better in stock app.4)No problem in gaming.5) Battery charges in about 70-75 mins fully from 0 to 100.6) In normal usage, battery last for atleast a day.7) In heavy mode, battery last for 4-6 hrs.8) Battery some times get warm even in normal use.Overall: Not good for photography and not best for gaming but this phone offers 2nd best in everything which no other phones in this price segment does.

"
"

  Overall the device is pretty good. It performs well and charges super quick. Everything is good.But there are several areas where I'm facing issues.1.  When I connect my Nord to my car bluetooth, the car's display shows only 2 buttons (Playpause and Settings). But when I connect the older OnePlus 5t, there are 4-5 buttons being displayed i.e. Playpause, repeat, shuffle, list etc.Before Nord, I was using Moto g4 plus and there were still 2 buttons for which I thought the reason to be the older android version. But the same issue is with my OnePlus Nord. Totally disappointed with this.I checked this in my 2018 Grand i10 stock Infotainment system.If you can help, I'll be thankful.2. Why isn't the rear camera setup able to record videos in 4k 60 FPS? The front camera has lesser megapixels but is able to record in 4K60FPS. OnePlus should roll out an update soon to solve the issue.

"
"

  My best mobile ever. So smooth like butter and I am feeling very happy to have one plus in my hand. Battery back up is just awesome, very first response, camera is very good, you can use both mobile data and wifi data simultaneously, you can instantly find an object by the help of Google lens inbuilt with the camera, nice feel of the handset when in hand, dedicated ringtone or vibration key at right side, dual channel network selection, dual volte, very good indisplay fingerprint sensor, you will get back cover in the box and screen protector already with the handset. If you are thinking a very good high end alrounder phone then you can purchase this OnePlus Nord, you will not regret.

"
"

  I would like to say that the look and features of the phone is really nice but what I found missing is the notification light ,camera quality was not same as OnePlus other phone as m user of one plus 6 from last two year and most concern part is bettry life m not using this phone that much still the phone is sucking up battery so fast n taking time in charging also ....this is only my top concern otherwse feature is nice m not that much technical but whatever was in my last phone this is better easly can go for it no device is perfect rather u spent lack or thousands ull find any of lackness in something everywhere .....thanks amzon for best deals I got this phone at 26 k that is pretty gud ...my only concern is bettry pls let em know if someone facing same then I'll go for exchange ü•∫

  Very good smartphone. Display quality excellent. Bettery backup very good.smooth OS no lags. am very happy with this and go for it .

"
"

  This phone is worth it.Pros:1. Oxygen OS is butter smooth and the experience has been amazing.2. Screen is superb as well. Its a breeze to watch content on this screen.3. Battery life is great as well. For my usage getting almost 6.5-7.5hrs of SOT everytime.4. Fingerprint sensor is pretty accurate for 90% of the times.Cons:1. Camera could have been better. Dont get me wrong, the main camera(48MP) from OP8 is totally worth it. The other cameras are either useless or are not up to the mark. Selfie camera is also not that great if you compare to previous OP 16MP sensor.2. The mono speaker is loud enough but its not even near the amazing experience of 7T's stereo speakers. This is not a con but rather a wish that is unfulfilled.This phone has been worth the amount that I paid for it. I have received almost 5updates till now, which have improved the camera, battery etc.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader and Face unlock both are fast. Camera is not as per hype created before launch but it is decent. Processor is quite good. I am satisfied with everything except it's BATTERY. Nowadays almost all the smartphone brands are offering bigger batteries (>5000mah) but OnePlus has compromised with the battery in Nord. I have to charge twice in a day. As their charger (30W) is quite good so it gets charged quickly.

"
"

  Phone looking good and hand feel nice, camera good, why audio jack missing in this phone? But oxygen os is superb experience you forget everything, but I am very disappointed why no Auto call recording is basics require on this time in every phone, please OnePlus improve it on immediate basis that would be great,And also battery backup not up to the mark.But dear friends you can go with this phone every thing is very good

"
"

  Pros.1.display too good.Cons:2. No return policy.3. Very bad front camera ,It looks like less than  5mp.4. Heating issues after 25mts of usage and then hanging5 no proper response from Amazon customer care.6. Very very poor whatsapp video call quality.

"
"

  This phone is worst in this price range it gets heater after browsing facebook or just wathing a 5 mins video on YouTube.. totally disappointed... 12gb ram mobile getting heated by browsing totally not satisfactory

"
"

  1. Actually the cost will be around 10k r 12k. I have expected a good camera quality.2.Display issue.3.Battery Draining like hell.4. You cant use message authentication with google pay r any other app that recognizes auto OTP for a dual sim.  This the feature where it totally failed.5. Voice Assistance is not up to the commands are going wrong.6. The accessibility feature for Blind people is totally ignored, they cant use the , where the many cases are failed for that.7. All the youtube channels ( UNboxing ONeplus Nord )are sold because they didn't find out the issues and showcases the fake news abt the phone.it totally failed the product.These Chinese manufacturers proved they are good at selling dummy products.

  Well Honsetly Redmi had changed the market completely with their superior configuration and smart marketing strategy into delivering a decent budget phone.Having said that after using Redmi phones from past 4-5 years, needed a change and then came this mid- budget phone with extradinory specs and  premium design.Not to mention got it in steal deal price by exchaning my previous Redmi phone and the pre-order bank offers.Pros -Display and fingerprint reader - Well this was a big surprise for me as I had not been used to such beautiful effortless display which just follows your command as you want. It makes you feel that you are holding a premium phone without a doubt. Fingerprint reader is exactly at right position and works seamlessly.Speakers - Well some people are reviewing the speaker is not upto the mark but based on my experience the speaker is very good compared to my any previous Redmi phones I was using. In fact you would be easily satisy with the sound at 75% itself.Oxygen OS 11 - I was a Google nexus fan initially which used to give straight pure Android out of the box. Well this Oxygen OS is equally good.The balance between the original Android and the Oxygen OS 11 is very UI friendly and a new user will definitely feel a sense of friendliness with the UI. It has already got two major updates.Battery life - Again a plus point for an average mobile user.It easily spends complete day with me with lot of phone calls and what's app chats with good amount of juice still remaining durign the bed time.And what a charger man. Just 15-20 minutes of charging is required and this boost up like anything.Cons -Camera quality - Yes that's right. There could have been some mprovement areas in the camera section based on the price tag but still it does its part for a medium user.Headphone jack missing - Probably it's a new trend but it still pushed me to spend some additional bucks for a wireless bluetooth headphone.Overall It's a good budget phone which one should definitely consider it in this price range and it surely justify it's tag - Pretty much everything you could ask for.!!!

  Very good again from OnePlus. They manage to keep the trust of their fans once again.Pros :1. 90hz refresh rate with AMOLED display feels awesome.2. Oxygen OS from one plus has one of the best user experience in the Android Market at present. No unnecessary blotware or Ads3. Battery life is very good. With moderate usage it will last for a whole day or slightly more. For extensive gamers, it will give around 12 hrs of battery life. You won't complain about battery because of the Warp charge 30T. It will charge your phone to 100% in 52-55 mins.4. Dual selfie camera is outstanding. Can capture details very well alongwith a wide angle option.5. Main primary camera perform very Good. Sony IMX586 sensor captures details very well. Nightspace mode allows better photography at night as wellm6. Although there is a lower chipset in Snapdragon 765G, but trust me there is hardly a few milliseconds difference on comparing it with higher Snapdragon chipsets. You won't notice the difference until you are a very hardcore gamer7. Software Updates for 2 years is another welcoming thing with this phone.8. One plus alert slider is always a plus in its devices9. Great video recording options from both the front and rear cameras. OIS and EIS help you to record 4K videos with great clarity.10. No display Or Tint issues about which many people were concerned.11. Although India might not have 5G support right now, this phone provides 5G facility making it future proof.Cons :1. Macro camera doesn't seem to useful at all. It is just added for the sake of increasing the number of cameras on the device. Overall camera details could have been better.2. Plastic frame on the sides could seem to be a negative point considering Gorilla glass protection on both the front and back sides. Using a phone cover won't make you recognise it.Opinion : Although some features might not be the best , but when you look at the phone as a whole, it definitely is a complete package.I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a mid-ranger with a premium experience.

  Well, this is my first experience with any OnePlus phone. i bought this 12Gb-256 gb variant and i'm impressed with the phone's daily performance. Earlier, I was using the Mi A1 for past 3 years and needed a change. Since I was accustomed to Android One I felt OxygenOs was the to go option for me this time around.I am impressed with OxygenOS, Smooth and easy to work around with customization and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb)Pro‚Äôs:‚Ä¢ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display is good and Battery lasts the whole of the working day(around 10-17% at the EOD).‚Ä¢ OxygenOS Nothing Tops It.‚Ä¢ Camera‚Äôs ‚Äì Well, I do love taking snaps form mobile and work around with tweaks for everyday stories. I'm impressed with the image processing, the nightscape and the front cameras utility. The Image quality is quite good with respect to other Mid Rangers.‚Ä¢ Stable video recording is a boon on this one. Perfect‚Ä¢ Future Conscious 5g‚Ä¢ Battery Performance is a big plus with the involvement of warp  charge.‚Ä¢ Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset ‚Äì works fine and doesn't let you down while undergoing heavy usage. Gaming is quite okay.‚Ä¢ No Display Issue. Maybe fixed over the second batch sales.‚Ä¢ A prettymuch everything you could ask for.‚Ä¢ Good Performance throughout the day.Cons:‚Ä¢ The depth sensor and macro are literally not worth the promotions and hype they built for‚Ä¢ Heavy users might not love this one.‚Ä¢ No Headphone JackI don‚Äôt find more cons as of now

  it's midrange device so it's unfair to expect High which I realised after using it.First of all there are lots of,lots of minor bug in overall operations.Big issue including display tinting, camera performance, useless micro camera, battery optimization,and some stock Google apps for msg and calling which literally sucks.It seems this device is still in testing phase and not very stable.UFS 2.0 literally pathetic here, u can see loading in motion.I must say...it's just not one plus standard.

"
"

  Pros-1. Smooth interface. (Oxygen Os)2. Screen is very good.3. Picture and video from the front camera is crisp.4. Video from the main camera is very standard.5. Internet speed on this phone is faster than my Honor 8 Pro over the same wifi network.  (Don't know the reason though)6. Can play the popular games without any hiccups.Cons-1. Pictures from the main camera is not upto the standard of a 28k phone.

  Received before the expected date, on Janmashtami. What an auspicious day to receive phone, its a gift to my wife. Temper proof packaging. Surprised to know that its manufactured by Oppo & good part its made in India.Basis usage on day one.Superb screen, bright colors, awesome lag free performance for 4k videos thanks to 8gb ram and super fast 765G processor which is Said to be among the 10best mobile processors Available in the world.Not observed any heating during full charging or playing videos etc. Got download speed of 4mbps Using 4g sim. Fast charging , full charge in 50 min. Camera quality is good. 2x zoom and 10x digital zoom. Good performance with flash for both front and back cameras under dark conditions, in my case there is no light in room. Though nightscape mode is available but not good and not clear pic. So use flash instead of nightscape mode. Disappointed with camera zoom And should have been better. Overall Fantastic performance For phone.Phone came along with silicon back cover but it smell too bad. So wash silicon back cover before use. Decent battery back up considering wifi, data usage vid play. OS is latest and meets the exoections. As promised by one plus received 6months of extended warranty. Suggest to purchase with Acko warranty.Finger sensor and face unlock still to be checked.Will update further with longer use of phone.

  The phone goes into a hang mode just like a computer. It is not possible to switch off or reboot. I find this phone very complicated. I will give it only passing marks while the phone Resmi k20 Pro is an excellent phone, very cool and handy. I will give it 100 out of 100

  I have been using Nord for almost 4 days now.General issues reported by others :- Many users have faced display issue, which I didn't face, not even slightly.- Camera quality is not that bad as shown in some reviews, though I'm not that much using camera. But still photos, from front cam and back cam are good and clear. Video recording is good.- some users have faced battery drain issue but not for me. I'm getting avg of 7 hrs SoT, with total of around avg 23 hours in single charge. In this 7hrs, I payed around 2 hrs of CODM, streamed videos for about 3hrs and rest general work. Also note that during this time, Bluetooth was connected all the time. So I'd say battery backup is good and if you don't play any games then it might last you around 9 hrs of SoT.- Fingerprint reader is fast and working good.Many are facing other issues but I haven't faced any of them including network problems. But if faced, you can go to community where they have shared some suggestions which might help you out.Also I haven't switched to 60hz, during all these usages, screen was at 90hz.Overall performance is blazing fast and device feels premium.Great experience using Oxygen OS. 90hz is feels very smooth.In a sentence you can say that it's great device.

"

  Pros :1) Very good processor2) 90hz display makes scrolling very smooth3) Charging speed is good (30watt charger)4) Oxygen OS5) Build quality and looks6) Comes with pre applied screen guard and back coverAverage things :1) Camera is ok for the price range but not great2) Battery (4100mAH) is just averageCons :1) No headphone jackCons:1)

  One of the best phones on the budget of 30000 Rs. The camera and display is the best among this segmentsThe phone is little over sized. The battery is good not best.For gaming its worth to play some good hard games.I bought this after using one plus 7 for the years .The slow motion shot is awesome in sun light. The night mode in the camera is best option to shot on objects on the dark.The overall i give  9 out of 10.The Accessories need to reduce the price is more good option.

"
"

  I purchased nord for my wife just for camera and oh boy camera quality is bad, indoors pictures are too much grainy, front camera quality is also bad.I tried to play with camera settings but still a bad camera phone.My wife's 3 years old moto Z takes much better photos.I already have oneplus 7T and it has great camera. But this time OnePlus let me down.I will try to return this.Edit: tried to request return, however bad photos is not good enough reason to return phone, a technician will check Phone and confirm if return is possible.Edit 2: So return was denied as grainy images issue is not a valid issue to return device.If camera quality is important to you, please look for other device.

"
"

  Finally I got one plus nord which is best middle budget from from OnePlus. This was not expected from one plus at all coming to pros and cons of phone.Pros:* One plus has provided 30T charger which helps to charge quickly it takes 0 to 100, 45minutes.* Display is fantastic provided fluid amoled display.* Refresh rate 90hz it's very fast and good experience.* Looks like premium experience.* Battery performance is absolutely fantastic.Cons:* Camera quality is not gud at this price we can get gud phones which was especially for camera, mainly rear camera 2MP was waste instead they might have replaced with 5MP seems good.* Build quality they have designed plastic frame seems worried.* Performance wise they have installed 765 Snapdragon with 5G technology, so at this price we are getting better performance phones like realme X2 pro.* There was no 3.5 ear phone jack and Dolby atmos.* Speaker was built down side of the phone so it disturbs a lot better speaker was built above the phone.* For gaming we cannot experience good.Overall, for regular usage and especially for people who are willing once a while with latest technologyI.e., 5G can go with this phone, those who are purposely purchasing for gaming better to go for other phones at this price.

  Fingerprint reader is as fast and efficient as one would want. The camera is subtle , the AI does a pretty nice job . The macro camera I haven't used much but didn't seem to be impressive . The front and the rear cameras are up to the mark. Dont expect it to be very zoom efficient, but it gets the job done in most of the cases. You will love the camera anyway . Night mode is super luminous in this phone ,you can't tell if it's a night or evening. Display quality , build everything is good but the battery is drained pretty quickly. Like with calls , WhatsApp & browsing it hardly lasts a day. the fast charger could have been more Efficient.  Also it doesn't feel like a 12 GB RAM phone sometimes

"
"

  This is an unbiased review from my side with personal use of this device from past 5 days.Pros- Amoled Display is very good from viewing any angles. The colors are so rich especially the blacks are really black.- battery.... After a week of use after heavy use it lasts for a day. But the charging technology oneplus uses is mindblowing. In 20 minutes of charge you will get more than 40 % battery charged.- cameras are really great work doing front and rear. Literally the videos don't have shakiness.-fingerprint sensor is very adaptive. So smooth and fast.  Don't forget to set your fingerprint before applying any screen protector.-personally i love the alert Slider of Oneplus devices.-Future ready Device this is 5G ready phone.Cons--missing the 3.5mm audio output jack. I have apple airpods so i dont need that 3.5mm jack. But you can purchase connector from the same.-Missing Stereo Speakers.-don't forget if you purchasing this device in 64 GB storage version. This device doesn't support expandable Storage. I have purchased the 256 GB version to get rid of storage problem.- macro camera sensor of this device worst. Don't try to use that üòúüòú

  Battery drains too fastAll of sudden phone turns blank with one plus logo and come back to normal only after reboot is doneThis happend with me thrice in just 4 days of useIf you have any unsaved number you cannot find the number by just dailing last 3 to 4 digitI would recommend to wait and later buy this product once these bugs are removed esle no use of buying this phone instead you can go for samsung oppo in the same range

"
"

  1. Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....2. Camera: Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average.3. Display: Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. I have vivo z1 pro & Redmi note 9 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and this is only for 18k aprox. OnePlus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product. 2 rating giving for this. Otherwise features are good.

  im using the device since 20 days and my review for the device.Great value for money product with having a good mid range processor. 90 Hz fluid amoled display gives smoother experience. camera was awesome at the price point and believed to be software update for camera for more crisp camera quality...in love with OnePlus oxygen ui..

"
"

  Premium Phone...Better Than Expected ...One of the Best Mid Range Phone..Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud.5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) The phone looks and feels premium while using.7) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.8) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The macro lens is useless, and the camera struggling at low light..Overall It's good..2) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.3) The plastic frame but it doesn't look like plastic but it is and it makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.

  Phone looks pretty classy even being so simple in style. Display Experia is pretty smooth, camera isn't as other one plus but it's also pretty good at this price. Gaming performance is also good. Sometimes you will see a bit heating after high use but it's ok at this price.

"
"

  The device is beautiful.Charging speed is a major highlight.There are some software related issues which I hope the OnePlus team will rectify asap.Camera is fine except the macro.Also I didn't find depth sensor much useful.I prefer the gcam for portraits.i get an avg battery life of 6 to 7 hrs under optimised conditions.Front cameras are gud. The speakers are also loud.Also there are some connectivity issues with OnePlus buds.Speaking overall it is a great piece of tech.I like the overall design, weight and balanced output from it.I have been getting constant updates from OnePlus, which help the device better in many small ways.I took the 256gb variant which is a gud one and I would recommend it but if depends on person to person, so I have no storage issues till now.I was able to play pubg at hd graphics which was great, like I was satisfied.Other games also run well, like pretty smooth.Heating up is there but insignificant if you don't play at a stretch.I have been having some troubles with a few apps but as I said they are rectified.I am enjoying it.üëç

  Sharing my review based upon experience of 5 days using Oneplus Nord Grey Variant (12+256)Classifying the major aspects in average, good and superb.1. Body - Good. Feeling like having premium mobile in my hand2. Battery - Superb. After my office time of 9 hours, battery was still more than 50%.3. Performance and processor - between Good and superb. Few times it took 3-4 seconds to process galary. Might be becasue I had kept 60Hz. I am not gamer, so idea on that part. Overall, very smooth.4. Camera -Oh my god..so much hype there.1. Primary camera - extremely superb. I do not use macro camera. So no comments on that. Picture quality even in 12 MP is awesome.2. Front camera - Well. Here I will say average. Little bit whitish issue. Hope it will be improved in future updates. Video quality in both cameras - SuperbWhere it could have been better ?1. 3.5 MM jack - not there2. LED light for notifications - missing3. They could have provided beast front camera to just eliminate competitors. However, it's not that bad. Pretty good selfies.Highly recommended üëçüëç

  Camera is not that great as the pixel 4a, but for this price range I doubt any other phone can add up to this currently. This is a great buy or if u can wait, wait until the 4a hits Indian markets.. the OnePlus is a fast,fluid,amazing phone. I own the 12gb version, if anyone is looking to buy this phone, I would recommend getting the 8gb or 12gb version because this phone has slower ufs 2.1 storage(approx 18 sec slower than ufs 3.0),this means that loading games and application are slower and in the long run it would get even slower, so go for the bigger ram versions, also there is no sd card slot so it would be better to get the bigger storage versions.All this and my 12gb version is heaven,for this price range, at this time I could not find a better phone that looks good and performs well also. But if anyone can wait for the pixel 4a, go for it.

"
"

  Rear camera photos are overexposed, can't find the details clearly,its low grade compared to cheap mobile camera but front camera takes ok shots, performance is slow, buffering,my previous OnePlus 3t was far better in terms of speed,signal issues,12gb ram runs like 2 gb ram, horrible, terrific experience

  Hi, I purchased one plus nord on 31st aug sale since i am facing 2 problems with it. First is while searching on google sometimes it tells you are offline despite of having adequate signals, i never faced such problem with my other mobiles at aome location.Second , mobiles becomes automatically silent wothout any change in setting, it happened many a times with me , when i mossed many calls because ot becomes silent automatically.Furthermore one plus  customer support system is very poor , i am trying to contact since i have purchased it but all the time customer service number remains busy. I have mailed also about the problem but didn't get any reply till.

"
"

  Camera:  Quality (both front & back) not like a flagship as hyped by OnePlus. Macro and depth are fake. Front camera problem is after clicking you have to stay still for about 2 sec to get clear image else get blur. Main cam and ultrawide are ok in daylight and struggle in the night.Display: slight red and green tinting can be observed in dark.Performance: is good for day to day normal use.Battery: is sufficient and charging speed is good.Overview: Overall ok phone if u want 5G go for it. Cameras are disappointing. Display could have been better. Price should have been 20-24k.OnePlus flagship phones are better. I find my OnePlus 5 better than this.

  1. Yes. It is one the best mobile phone within this price range. In-spite of all other reviews, I wanted to try this out by myself and it's comes up amazing in every corner.2. Obviously it's having some cons but it can be overcome with your smart move. For example: every where it was told that camera performance not up-to the mark. believe me or not but it's really minor which you can modify. use google cam if not happy with stock camera app.3. Best part of this phone is having same Oxygen OS like onplus 8 & oneplus 8 pro. If you are 1st time user for this kind of android, then my recommendation is try any stock android with google phone or Oxygen OS with Oneplus. You will feel the the differences with other phones.Won't say any more.. Better you try this out then say anything.. if not like it you have 10 days return policy.

  Delivered on 24th AugDisplay - good, no tint or spots yet.Speaker - loudCamera - Average or above (depending on lighting conditions)Battery - Average.Wrap charger - Approx 30-45 mins for full chargeFingerprint reader - works fineWish it had 3.5mm audio port.

"

  I feel it's an average phone as per the price, the processing is good, but i feel the camera which is the major factor for this phone isn't that good it take decent picture on full light but does extreme on medium light and i feel it highlights the shadows more than its needed.The back is glass which requires extra protection and camera isn't the first priority of yours it's a good phone.

"
"

  Worst packaging ever . When I saw this item I was completely shocked. I thought my item must be damaged . But the phone was completely safe and nowhere damaged. I hope Amazon should improve the packaging and made it premiumNowPhone is goodDisplay is excellentCamera is pretty goodOxygen OS is marvelousOverall performance is goodLittle bit heating issueSometime camera is taking time after taking multiple shots

"

  ¬†It's an awesome phone and best in class with the price it has.First and foremost I would like to clear all of you that there is no pink tint issue or camera black breakout issue with the phone, they were just rumors.I have uploaded the video checking the same by my own with device I have purchased.No such issue, and camera quality is absolutely fine I must say.Pictures I have clicked from my front selfie camera are almost level of DSLR clicked.If anybody or any tech reviewer mislead you towards tint or black crash rumors, I will suggest that please buy and check by your own.Amazon have very easy return policy.So buy and check.If you don't buy, you will miss a great 5G smartphone in lowest of price.And again it's Oneplus.No doubt at all,I am one plus user since 2015, one plus two, 6T McLaren edition and now Nord 12/256.No one can beat them for sure, they are real flagship killers by the virtue of quality and hardware they provide.

"
"

  1. You ll be surprised but battery back up is not at all good, charging covers it but bckup is very bad.2.Macro and depth camera's are pretty useless and to my surprise selfie camera doesn't even compare with redmi note 7pro it is that bad in low light, unnecessary boost and contrast.3.There is huge gap below keyboard, could be fixed via update but oneplus isn't doing the same.4. Performance is very good, no lag no complains..UI is smooth and perfect, Dark mode needs improvisation though.Overall if you don't have any urgency don't go for this phone, all the issues could be improved with software updates but let us hope oneplus does that.

"
"

  I exchanged op-6 for this phone. Very much satisfied with the processing power . Spectacular improvement in display quality. Sound is also very good. Weight balance is very good ,I didn't felt it is of 184 gm. I am satisfied with it.Camera needs to be improved. Too many blurry images.Battery improvement is not satisfactory.I am getting little more usage time compared to op-6.

"
"

  I bought Nord with 12GB+256GB configuration.Some of my observations are:1.Its a single SIM phone2.Do not have 3.5 audio jack (No wired earphones)3.got heated while updating apps for the first time, after that no heating4.camera quality is superb5.No screen lagging due to 90Hz amold display6.It really has premium look.7.it's the best combination in this price range.Overall rating9/10

"
"

  There are lots of issues with this phone both in hardware and software.Battery drains as fast it gets charged. It doesn't last for 10 hours.Camera quality isn't good as compared to other phones at this price.There are other issues with notifications in recent release.This product looks just hype. Not worth of money they are selling. Looks like OnePlus fooled people who were looking for mid-range budget phones.

  Please don't buy this mobile as it has so many issues.1.Auto call recording is not working in this mobile.2.It comes with google dialer not with one plus orignal dialer google has some limitations.3.Major issue in Email sync , synchronisation is not works so if you want to use this mobile for business purposes then think twice before buying as you need to chek mail manually by swapping email client.4.One plus caller identification like True caller which is available in other models is missing in this model.IF anyone want I am ready to sell my one plus 2500 below Amazon price I don't want this phone

"
"

  The camera of the phone is quite amazing! Love the screen quality, has completely changed my viewing experience. The battery life has improved since the latest update. All-in all I've been very happy with my one plus Nord -posting the review after using it for over a month.The only issue that pinches is the lack of an audio jack. Not everyone is comfortable with bluetooth earphones and while using a c type connector - the audio quality isn't very great.

"
"

  After usage more than 10 days my reviews:1. 90 hz refresh rate is good but due to low processor phone lags sometimes.2. Camera quality is ok, but not upto the mark what i thought about OnePlus.3. Heating issue is there for continuous usage of 4-5 applications some time. And it takes few minutes to cool down.4. Battery drains faster. For continuous usage need to charge twice or thrice a day. And takes around 1.5 hrs from 20 to 100%5. For gamers is not good choice. Phone lags during heavy game. And refresh rate is not as they said. Things happened in the game reflects after 4-6 seconds.6. During video call phone speaker automatically turns off and it goes on earphone mode. (Very irritating while video calls). Becomes difficult to hear at earphone mode and than talk on video.7. Most of time my number shows out of network. Don't know why.? It was not same issue in my old phone. Sim chipset might have some bugs.

  One plus nord (8+128)I got this phone around 27000 with ICICI BANK 1000 rs Cashback offer. I want to buy 12+256 but that was not available onsite at the time so I purchased this 8 +128gb with oneplus bullet wireless earphone. The colour is quite good.fingerprint sensor is awesome is responsive and fast.I just changed from 10000 phone to 30000 rs and it's my first expensive phone.Battery life is somewhat I can say negative point in this but I have to charge 2 times per day. But with the help of 30 word it can charge so fast.Camera quality is very good in this price.Display is also very ee islii colour optimised so it's quite good to see a big display with oneplus AMO LED.Front dual camera is also good in this segment.Blue colour is quite awesome and very cool.I was just confused with the colour option but finally about the blue one and it's awesome really awesome so don't think just go for it.

  Best phone ever good to buy .... everything is ok but I m very disappointed with customer care executive ( Abhishek and Sayantoni) they give me bad and wrong commitment and misguide with product delivery date and time also not able to resolve the query....and also without my permission  my product is rescheduled..still disappointed from Amazon customer care service.

"
"

  Those who wants to buy this phone , he or she should know about cons of this mobile too because no one talks about cons and this mobile have serious issues that might be important to you. The very serious issue is that about BLUETOOTH , it has been 2months since this phone is launched and they haven't done anything about this . The issue is bluetooth doesn't work properly in this and this is annoying because it doesn't have headphone jack that's why we must have bluetooth headphones . Bluetooth automatically disconnects but doesn't connect automatically again , you have to go in the settings and connect it manually.This disconnection happens in every 10-15mins . literally how can they make this phones with many issues ? Atlast if u want to buy it you have to know its cons too.

"
"

  Product is good but its over priced only because of brand. Battery life is not great and lack of headphone jack hurts. Phone heats very quickly and camera quality of rear side is more than average but not great. OnePlus has not given many features in this device like it gives in other devices, kind of lighter version of Oxygen O.S is used.

  Hi I have order 12gb Blue marble OnePlus Nord by amazon on 6 Aug. I got this device on 8 Aug from that I faced battery issues draining very fast also for 5mins YouTube video surfing the mobile getting heat as much. I can't able to tolerate this from oneplus and also I have spent 30k for this device. I have contacted amazon technician team they told to install blancco app and they checked there is a battery problem and heating issues. And they told sir this time we can't replace your device due to no stock. They registered complaint against for replacement ones the device getting back in stock. But my available time is 20 Aug. Please resolve my issue and give a replacement device for this device.Apart from the battery the mobile is premium while using. We definitely feel the flagship experience in OnePlus Nord. I appreciate OnePlus for this smoothness. Only drawback is battery otherelse mobile is awesome.

  Exact issueShows you are offline despite connected to wifi as well as mobile network.... Repeated error on google searchOthers can't reach you as it will say you are not available. You wont even get message later ...checked with jio and airtel no issues from their end ...device related issue

"

  This phone is a nightmare for heavy users. You need to carry the charger wherever you go. The front camera is pathetic. Reminds me of nokia 6600 I used 15 years back. The apps start on their own and it hangs a lot. Talked to customer care and followed their instructions, still behaves the same way . Amazon please take this phone back.

  This review is being written after 2 weeks of usage with the phone. In a nutshell, I would say that the phone has performed extremely well for me. I will list out the pros and cons here from my experience over two week.Pros:1. The Snapdragon 765G processor coupled with the 12GB of RAM helps the phone run very smooth. Other than the occasional negligible hiccups experienced on any phone, I do not have any complaint about how smooth the phone is.2. Fortunately, my device has not yet experienced any kind of screen tinting or black bar issues.3. The 90Hz refresh rate is so satisfying to use. Though inferior to 120Hz displays, it barely makes any differences in terms of watching YouTube videos or so.4. The 765G processor is indeed optimized for gaming, as I was able to get a smooth experience with Call Of Duty with Graphics and Frame Rate maximised. I did not experience any kind of lag. Other games like PES and Asphalt 9 were also running very smooth for me.5. The 30W Warp Charger is indeed pretty fast. I usually charge my phone from 30-100% and it takes somewhere around 30-40 minutes for this.6. There is hardly any bloatware on the phone and most of the pre-installed apps can easily be uninstalled at your convenience.7. The Colour Saturation on the screen is pretty well managed and you even have various options to adjust that to your preferences.Cons:1. The battery life is something that I am a little disappointed about. If you are looking for a phone which can get you through the day with occasional surfing and videos, then definitely go for it as it can stay alive for an entire day without recharging, but if you are a gamer, then I suggest you look for alternatives as games tend to drain your battery quite a lot.2. Camera wise, I would say it is good, as the 48MP main camera does capture good quality pictures with proper colour saturation and details, but when it comes to the wide angle camera, sometimes, the edges seem to blur out a little, thus reducing the detailing. The Depth enabled sensor is also pretty good, though sometimes it suffers in recognizing the foreground and background and may blend in together, though majority of pictures came out pretty good. It is better not to talk about the macro lens as they are way below average. I would suggest anyone to not use them, instead click with your main camera and crop out and you are guaranteed better quality pictures. Low Light photography is also average as most of the pictures are grainy, but the nightscape option makes the pictures look fantastic even in low light. The selfie camera was also good as it captured some quality pictures.3. While gaming I did experience a negligible amount of heating, though it could have been due to other factors.4. The plastic frame of the phone is a drawback, though a quality bumper case would solve that problem once and for all.Barring these few drawbacks, I would recommend the phone to everyone mainly because OnePlus is very punctual in rolling out system and security updates. Also there are many inbuilt features such as the one that automatically suppresses notifications while gaming.

  So i was really excited for my first one plus phone but only thing special about it is oxygen os everything else is just ordinary.CamerasMain camra and ultra wide cameras are really good. Although I am not able to see difference between 12 mp and 48 mp photosPortrait mode photos are below average. Very poor edge detection. My old phone with single camera detecte edge better that this one. 90% times i didn't get a good photo with nord. 1 photo attachedMacro camra is just there its of no use. Personally i think i will never use it but even if anyone want to use it its of no use it captures blurry photos all the time.Selfie cameras are very good they don't beautiful you and capture great photos. Both look really good in good lighting conditions but in low light ulrra wide capture little darker imagesTime lapse is good slow mo is average and night mode also goodOsOxygen os is excellent with some unique and cool features like changing accent color. Only one problem i feel is that it uses lock screen password for app lock which iam not a big fan of.Blotware pre-installed. The one you can uninstall are Facebook, Insta, amazon and some one plus apps. That you can not uninstall are Netflix, YouTube music.BatteryBattery on nord disappoints me the most. I use 90hz refresh rate. Its get me total stand by time of 12 to 13 h With screen on time of about 6h. That mean if i charge phone in the morning i have to charge it by end of the day again and i don't even play games (screen shot attached).Charging is great it charges 0 to 100 in about an hour if not using it. And around 1h 15 min if i use it during charge.DisplayIt look beautiful. And with 90hz its its really fast on scrolling through insta. And i don't have any tint issue with it. I am glad i didn't choose another lcd panel phoneOther thingNo notification led is really a pain. Hope one plus provide always on display soonNo headphone jackFingerprint and face unlock is fast and reliable didn't face any single issue with them till now.Speakers are loud and clear. Not to loud but i can say it's above average.Haptic  is cool.Design feels good and premium. And the form factor is just perfect.Google phone really suck. I cant record call without informing other person in the call. It give a loud warning when starting call record that other person can also hear.Phone runs smooth no issues with the performanceso the only disappointed for me is battery life and portate mode shots. I hope it get fixed with ota as promised by one plus on forum

  Ordered on 6th and delivered on 13th as promised by Amazon (Thanks to all the hype and demand). No complaints there!!.Have been a OnePlus customer myself in the past and having used other OnePlus phones, the nord does the same and gives that premium OnePlus experience for sure.Keeping specs aside, let's talk about the pros and cons from the daily use point of view.The Pro's:- Great in-hand feel. Feels premium.- Quick, responsive and lag free user experience,  thanks to great mid range processor and we'll  optimised OxygenOS.- Decent and Loud enough sound quality from  bottom firing speaker as well as headphones.- Best in class haptics for that premium exp.- Great AMOLED display with excellent colors. (There is no visible green tint. It's is just an  overrated issue. If you at all there is a green tint in the device , it is only ever so slightly visible at very low brightness in a pitch black room with a grey background only. So no need to worry there)- Good main camera and ultrawide camera. Also  the front cameras are excellent.- Good call quality.- Great sensors.-Great battery life. Got an average screen on time  of 6-7 hrs on decent usage (calls, video streaming,  music listening, social media consumption). I personally don't play games so the battery life is not a issue at all. Even if you are a gamer, you should get 5 hrs of screen on time.- Superfast charging. It literally charges full in less  than one hour.The Con's:- Useless 5mp depth and 2mp macro camera. It is  just of no use.- There is no headphone jack, which may bother  some people.Verdict:If you are looking for a phone that looks and feels premium, is quick and responsive, has gud battery life and charging times, can take good photos and has great software support, then this the phone for you.A Best All rounder !!!

  So I have been using this phone constantly for the past 3 days and here is my honest opinion:1. Camera could have been much better for this price. There are ton of phones out there in lesser price with better camera. But as this feature isn't my priority I won't be returning.2. I had been using Moto g4+ for the past 4 years and my usage is not that heavy so my priority was to get a good software (as close to the Google's version as possible). So far, I'm really liking oxygen OS and as promised it isn't bloated. The phone is smooth and since I bought the 8 gb ram -128 gb variant, I won't be needing a sd card so I can use 2 sim cards.3. Battery life is actually lesser than what brands like Realme or even Moto gives in this range but because of 30 watt warp charger, it isn't a huge issue for now. Will recommend getting a powerbank if your usage is heavy and have no nearby power outlet for most of the day.4. There is no tint issue in my phone and I'm not a gamer but I have noticed that the phone does slightly heat up after reboot from software update and once even heated up in Ludo. So if you're a gamer, I don't recommend this.5. The face unlock and fingerprint reader isn't very smooth. My previous phone had a fingerprint reader separate from the screen which felt more convenient. Also you would need to get bluetooth earphones as there isn't an audio jack so make sure you have the budget for both.Apart for this I'm really enjoying this phone. I don't have any experience with newer model phones but compared to my 4 year old moto phone, this feels definitely like an upgrade software and hardware wise and hopefully this phone will last long too.

  OnePlus cheated with promise of assured giftüò°

  A well balanced device..I am more of a performance guy , so at first, when I saw all the hype, specially about the cameras, I wasn't sure if I should buy this for just for the camera. So I did some research (a lot of actually)... Waited for a week after sale, so that I can get all the hands on reviews, the good ,the bad ,etc.One thing that I found was :-The specs were Good, not the best but Good enough.The camera had scope for improvement.The OS was the best part..A Great Screen...the tinting issue is very minor dosent affect anything for me personally. (not a OnePlus fan but still the issue isn't even noticeable)The biggest thing that made me buy this were the software updates ...I have been using the device since ....like the first update.... And it's just been getting better and better... An example of this would be...When I used the device after the 1st update I could go through 24hrs with 20-25% battery remaining at the end of the 24hrs...(screen brightness at avg 45%..screen at 90hz....normal useage....some gaming...some insta /msging...some entertainment...etc. )Now that's improved significantly..I get like 35-40hrs to get my device down to 20%...The updates have been addressing the camera issues too...but since I am not much of a camera guy..I can't provide much feedback on it...but for me personally....the camera seems good ..All in all... This device is only getting better!Good work OnePlus..... (PS - I hate the facebook app Installer bundled with your devices..)..

  Everything is great except the speaker.The recipient of the call is hearing all kinds of noises and disturbances.And as discussed with amazon technical support representative, this problem is occurring for about all users.Hoping for a quick fix or a replacement of the product.

  After using this mobile for 15 days ,I can strongly recommend people you can buy this mobile without any doubt.Camera -- looks good which is fine at this prcie range don't compare to High end mobile but believe this mobile will not disappoint you.Fingerprint -- sometimes you feel it's not that fast reader. But am satisfied with this.Battery -- I felt it's okay 4115 mah for the normal users but for gaming lovers you need minimum 5000 mah battery.Why you should buy one plus nord at this range--Pros :1. Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 processor.2. 90hz refresh rate which is really awesome.3. Warp charger - no heat issues.4. Camera is good not best.5. It comes with pre installed Oxygen OS.6. Design and build quality of this mobile is great but I would recommend all to please put back cover which can help you to keep the mobile in safeside.7. Price is good for 12gb ram and 256gb rom variant.Cons :1. while you play pubg little amount of heat I can feel hope this may improve in coming updates.2. Camera quality have to improve in next updates.3. No wireless earphones provided by the company which is really bad for 30k mobile they must have some plan for the customers because again we need to pay at least 2k for the wireless earphones.Conclusion--- this mobile gives you best experience and am happy to recommend all you please try this out at 30k this is best.

  Battery life is pathetic. Even in very light usage it drains in one day. Display is not at all good. You can compare good dslr photos in monitor(real view) and then compare on nord n also in other phones. It's pathetic. Skin tones are very off. Shadows are too dark. Even the display is not at all bright. Seems like using a cheap phone. Fingerprint is bit slow many times. Battery, display & camera is not good. Rest performance is good. Nothing great in this phone but a decent. Hype is just a waste.

"
"

  Great phone from OnePlus.1. Camera is great in outdoor conditions. Indoor seems to be dull.2. Smoothness of touch is great.3. Display is just awesome4. Charging is very fast. 10-100% charges is 55 mins5. Speaker sound is not that great6. Selfie camera is best. OIS and EIS are greatOverall great performance no lag played pubg and asphalt.

"
"

  Using the phone since last 7 days, Doesn't feel any problem with build(though frame is plastic).The only things bother me1. Display tint(not visible in total black image, but visible in chrome darkmode)2. Low light picture quality3. Unnecessary macro & depth camera.4. Though the launch is AR launch device doesn't support Google AR core(WTF OnePlus).

"
"

  Unlike what OnePlus had profoundly mentioned in their Amazon portfolio, the camera is ANYTHING BUT FLAGSHIP! 2MP macro is a ""2020 Joke of the Year"". Primary cam takes sharp photos under broad daylight but lacks depth. Under low light conditions, it just gives up. About selfie cam, don't even get me started. Overall, all SIX cameras suck.Processor is fast, but there are faster ones in the market within the bugdet. So, gamers.... DON'T invest here.Battery lasts a day on medium usage. If you are a heavy user, DON'T buy this phone. 90Hz refresh rate drains battery even faster. Wanderlusters, please keep the charger and an ELECTRIC SOCKET handy. Recharging is quick. Very quick.Fingerprint reader is fast, if not superfast like those physical ones. So unless you are stupid, refrain from comparison.Oxygen OS in one word: AWESOME. This was one of the major reasons why I purchased this phone. Bloatware free UI is something I had craved for. I hated those unsolicited ads on Xiaomis and Oppos and Honors et. al. Also, a near-flagship from Samsung or Apple was out of question as I like my kidneys more.Long-story-short: Touch, look and feel is premium. Great UI. However, if you are into photography, gaming, wired-music-maniac (I own a TWS, so don't really care), or really tight on budget, DON'T get this phone. Rest choice is yours.

"
"

  First of all I would like to say that this time seriously I did the mistake to bought this phone, honestly I am telling that before got this phone I was extremely excited because in my life this the is first expensive phone for me and that too one plus but when I got this literally I can not explain that what was I m feeling because my friend have one plus phone and I have used the phone of my friends so when I first time took into my hand I feel like what is that why I bought this why I waisted my money on this but now could not be done anything, you never feel like it's one plus phone screen is too small and I am not a heavy user and I only use the phone call sometime browsing but for that also it's not giving me expected battery backup as I am using one other phone where in the battery is only 3400 mah and that one is giving me battery backup better then this and the most important thing which was seriously not expected from one plus that is camera and its seriously bad bad bad even 13 mp camera phone is better then this guy's seriously I am telling you please do not go with this it's waisted of money now I wish to return this phone but nobody is listing my word and I can't return it so now it's pain to use this phone and seriously you never feel that you are using one plus mobile its feeling like normal phone only and I will never buy any one plus mobile now in my life.

  Overall its a nice oneplus package at this price, more of it, it has 5g.My review on Nord:1. Camera's colour processing is not upto the mark. You will notice this most while capturing indoors, as pics look bit faded. Camera processing takes a bit time for front camera so u have to hold the camera for a second after hitting shutter otherwise it will be shaky.2. Device is provided with Oxygen OS, the best android skin. Oxygen OS really feels smooth as butter and has a lot of handy features, the best part of it is the oneplus listens their community concerns and provide updates accordingly. But the thing I don't like is the device uses phone, message app provided by Google. So nord users will miss many features that oneplus phone and message app provides.3. Macro lens is useless, a telephoto lens should be provided instead. For macro shot u can try pro mode with manual focus and zoom.4. Battery is not that great but its the fact u will like that it gets fully charged within an hour.5. The display looks great. The most hyped display will be there in every amoled display with high refresh rate but no need to worry u will never notice that in ur day to day usage.6. Phone gets heat up a bit while charging but its not much. Its normal as ur phone gets charged so fast and its getting charged with 30watts.

"
"

  Yeah finally reviewing after almost 1 month and i can say this is a good phone under 30k where you can get pretty well software(Oxygen OS), decent battery, Nice smooth display, good fingerpint and last but not the least OK camera. It's camera performance is not the best and it's overall good with 4k60 fps Selfie video which is ultimate and also picture quality is good enough in day light and average in dim light.So what i can say is if you want to get rid of Redmi realme and can't but upper segment of OnePlus, this is a good decent phone. You can compare your needs with Oneplus or Samsung phones since those are also comes with good specs. But personally i don't like Samsung phones , so i have gone with Oneplus Nord.So yeah that's it.Thanks!!

  Don't buy Nord, OnePlus brand lovers definitely will loss your interest after use this Nord.Bettary back is tooooooooooooo worst..0% Rating to battery backup

  The photos u saw are from gcam.Let me divide this review I will try to cover as many aspects as I can.Display: Pro:Display is superb and really good.altough I didn't notice any difference between 90 and 60hz.Con:The display has a green tint issue and every oneplus Nord has. But it did not affect our daily usage.Design:Pron:glass back feels premium but I wish it had a mattle back.Con:it has a plastic frame so not very durableOs : should I right about it it's just a waste of time it's the bestProformance: good actual it's great with oxygen osGood gaming no lags noframe drops good.Con: it does not have 8 series chipset but I do not feel the difference.Features: mono speaker but sounded greatVibration is decent although I wish it could be better5g nothing to talk about itPrice : I think it's pretty good special for 12gb variat.Camera: camera sucks front and back both camera sucks it's just take shitty pictures.Oneplus plz give upates plz.Nord vs garbage phone likes k20 pro, realme x3 series.Nord is way way better than this phone.Nord vs x2 proU might be think that the x2 pro better on specs yes it is indeed and I think it is a better phone for gamers but for all other people(include me) who game a little or do not game Nord is better .Nord vs 7tSpecs are better on the 7t but it is worth rs.10kThink yourselfNord vs 8I was really confused between the two and for rs.17k here what the 8 addsBetter performanceBetter speakersCurved displayGood vibration motorBetter ultrawide cameraAlse everything is same .Nord vs a71Though choice but NordIt's simple really that simple it all comes down to really experience in which we have a new midrange king and it's the Nord

  I've been using Nord for one month now and my overall experience is awesome. I would specially like to mention the fast charging option OnePlus provides us with its Warp Charging technology which is really superfast compared to other mid-range sets. Battery life is decent. Some other significant things are its superb display which comes with 90 Hz refresh rate and obviously the cool and compact design with two uncommon colour options which gives a feeling of having a flagship model. The best thing about OnePlus is its supercool Oxygen OS which is undoubtedly the best in the industry right now. You'll also get various online storage benefits, subscriptions and discounts with your Red Cable Club membership in any OnePlus set. Gaming performance is okay, but needs to be more optimized. Processor is fast enough for multi-tasking and professional editing purposes and it comes with built-in 5G technology. The camera quality and image processing are good enough for casual photographers, although it's not recommended for professional photography. Nightscape mode is outstanding. The mono speakers are okay. Overall I would give 90+ out of 100 to this exciting OnePlus Nord model. I have also shared a couple of photos which I clicked using nightscape mode. Check those out. All the best.

  First, many suggested me not to buy this product after the release week, but I went for it due to the trust in company and ordered.Now, I recieved my mobile few days ago and found out huge problems... Below is the list.1. Snapchat :- The app layout in Nord(12/256) is so basic that it portrays the layout of a low end 5000/- mobiles.. the Bitmoji clarity is soo bad, pictures taken are always blurry, and you wont be abled to attend live filters, you should take picrures and then apply them.2.Whatsapp :-  Now a days video calling is the most common form of telecommunication, but the clarity of video call in Nord is very worse than ever.The video is dark and you could see the black outline all over the image processing at the back camera.In case of front, there is an smoke effect in front camera which reduces the clarity completely.3. Oneplus features :- Many old features of Oneplus had been removed here like (shelf, dock, etc)4. Camera Quality :-  The camera clarity is average, but there is a huge amount of grain in camera where it completely destroys the image quality.Front camera is worse..Others are common problems faced by all mid rangers.. like battery, Gaming, RAM handling etc

  Yesterday i have recieved mine...i have few issues with this mobile.....1.As soon as we click a picture from front camera we need to wait for some time with out moving phone to not have a blurry image...even a very lowest price phone doesn't have this backdrop they capture a non blur image as soon as we click and move phone.2.The battery back up is not as expected as i have been using one plus 6t, we checked both one plus 6t as well as nord at same usage from 100% charge and nord drained so fast where one plus 6t didn't.....3. The back swipe is lame its not working as expected everytime we need to swipe twice /thrice to go back....better if we change it to swipe up from either of the ends as all other one plus have.....4.when ever we click pictures infront of the mirrors the pictures are coming very bad with 0% naturality....not expected this from one plus.....very disappointed i have suggested my sis as well as my friend to buy one plus nord  as i was using one plus from very long time and i trust one plus....after receiving nord i seriously dont suggest nord to  anyone.....very disappointing actually..... if possible please resolve all of them with an update....on the second day of usage i have an issue with the main apps where it shows a blank page and not displaying any apps......

  Review after 10 daysFirst of all im just loving the Oxygen Os ‚ù§Ô∏èDisplay :- display is just too good for me.. but there is a pint tint towards the bottom of the screen, with latest 10.5.7 update that issue is 80% solved but with the expense of some brightness shifting. Its actually fine than having that tint issue isn't?üòÅPerformance:- Its just smooth... I doesnt faced any lags,stucks or any app crush its just flowless. But i can see some framedrops when i scroll through some pages. I played PES on this mobile iand it was just a breeze loved playing in the device.Camera:- im not a camera sedric person for me its more than enough good details and nyc colors. But front camera should have been betterBattery:- bettery is ok i would say it gives me 6 hrs SOT with 20 hrs of charge.But it drains very quickly in the overnight 7-8.Initially it takes more than 1 hr 10 min charge but the latest updated cragged up the speed now 0-100% in 55 that is litüòºOverall:- its a good premium midranger that you can look up to...i purchased this instead of RMX2 pro just because i wanted use the device for atleast 3 years. Since that is already an year old phone and  i choose OnePlus and the infamous Oxygen OS ‚ù§Ô∏è

"

  Nord is a good choice when it comes in to this range of 27999.. one thing I felt is ""please put a full charge and then start using"". I've seen some difference in screen. Initially I didn't liked the screen and I thought of changing it. But it's good in processing.

"
"

  All total the prpduct is very good with 90hz refreshment rate that makes it more faster and make sure the combination be 8g/128gb or better.. In a glimpse the camera is too good and selfie camera is also very likewise... The superamoled display makes it more attractive and good looking... A premium phone with premium features comes with the brand one plus and as a result the phone comes a good handy in this range of price... I recommemd every self worker or students to make a look at this model

"
"

  I am using this product for about 10 days now.Pros1) It(Marble Blue) has a very pleasing look and that is one of the major reasons which attracts people to buy this device.2) The User Interface is pretty good. Its really helpful as my previous phone had tons and tons of Bloatware.3) The Fluid Amoled display with 90Hz refresh rate is also quite nice.4) Battery Life : It almost lasts me for about 1.5 days (note: I don't do gaming, but spend more time in netflix, youtube and social media)5) Warp 30T is insanely fast. Charges my phone from 5-100% in about 51 minutes.Cons1) The Camera shoots good quality videos but only in daylight. It screws up in low light or in dark. It blurs the hell out of the surroundings making it undesirable. Same story with photos too. Some great quality during the daytime.2) Still trying to figure out the role of 2MP Macro sensor. I mean there is no reason for its existence. But even when its there, it is not working at all.3) Well, absence of 3.5 mm was anticipated but they could have given a connector in the box. That might have been beneficial for many.for better camera performance, use Gcam to click pictures. And use Stock Cam for videos.

  Without Wasting my words and Your time on Unnecessary Explanation, Let me get to the Points Straight.*765G, A 5G MidRanger Processor is a Decent Processor when it Comes to the Daily doing stuff. It's Reliable & Fast .But, Honestly It's UNNECESSARY, Specially As Per India Market And You Know Why.*Display Produces Punchy colours and Good viewing experience.*Look and In hand feel is really Good.*And Now Finally,for the People who haven't already Experienced OXYGEN OS, to them ""THE BEST THING OnePlus CAN OFFER is the UI of OnePlus"", It's Just Wonderful.And now The Most DEVASTATING Thing about The Most Hyped Phone of 2020 ""The OnePlus Nord"" is It's CAMERA. I mean We Are Paying 28000/30000 INR for a Phone that Has A Pathetic Camera module. It's It's Pathetic. Honestly My Old Xiaomi Note 7S camera Produces more Good Looking Photos. Forget about Specifications, What we are Getting is More Important, I Think.*And They're Some Issues regarding Mobile Data networking and THE HAPTIC VIBRATOR FEEDBACK. Like Some Other OnePlus Devices It Started pinning some Vibrator Issue.Finally, It's NOWHERE NEAR FLAGSHIP KILLER. Just a Decent Phone Which Costs More For It's 5G &""FUTURE READY"" TagLine.

"
"

  You will buy this phone only for 1+ brand name and not for performance. I have made a mistake and chosen wrong product. It does,t  meet my expectaion. it's tag line is Never Settle but in this phone they have compromises a lot.It is like ""fancy shop, tasteless Chines food"".

"
"

  ¬†I ordered this phone for my sister as a gift.She was very happy to receive this phone.Verdict.Livable camera, not so impressive but ok ok.Average battery life.Display is vivid and bright.A weird haze of green shade is present on the display, maybe because it's Amoled.Mono speaker is not so good.Problems.The proximity sensor stops working randomly.The device which I received has a display defect.Randomly the display flickers.Red, brown, green, black color bars come on the screen.I tried to get this resolved from Amazon.Somehow i was concerned about the product quality.I requested for a full refund so that I can order a better phone while the sale was still live.Amazon denied and suggested a technician visit, after that they will replace the product.I want to get a different brand or a higher variant of one plus, let's see if I get the refund.One thing is clear, Oneplus has done a lot of sacrifices on the product quality.I have lost trust on this brand.I would recommend to go for a higher variant 7t or 8t.Or some other brand.

"
"

  After a month of using this mobile, it is a clean,neat,fast & smart device which has an excellent display & OS. The main camera is as good as OnePlus 8 , but the other camera's are not at all worth. Battery life is average for an general daily usage. Small network,Bluetooth & display issues. Onething I am satisfied with OnePlus is getting updates constantly that feels me a premium feel. The community of OnePlus & the clean OS of it differ itself from other phones.Final verdict: If you believe in hype then it will not meet your expectations . If you think I need a good daily premium mobile with a good software updates in regular intervals this is the one.PLEASE DON'T BUY WITH HYPE , SEE THE SPECS WHETHER YOUR USAGE MEETS IT.

"
"

  The phone is really good. The blue color is really striking and awesome. Purchased the 12 Gig version and it is buttery smooth, even with a ton of apps running. Display is top notch and the 90 Hertz is super slick. The macro camera is not so useful, but the remaining cameras are super. Battery life is also good and the warp charging pumps it up in no time. Overall, a very good value for money. Would recommend 10/10.

"
"

  Got my device on 4th of Aug after placing a pre order on 28th July/I don't play any heavy end games on my mobile so gaming was never a problem/necessity for me.The display is nice, earlier I wasn't used to the AMOLED display but now I am satisfied with it.The Battery is generally very good and will last easily a day for normal usage.The camera? well I was never a photo enthusiast so I don't can't figure out the biggest down point of the device.I compared it with my brother's Samsung A50 and observed the Nord has a bit more accurate colors atleast for me.The only issue I found was the tint issue but that too is observed under very rare circumstances and probably will be fixed in a future OTA.TL;DR :- If camera and gaming aren't your priority and you need a good phone with a very clean OS then go for it.

"
"

  Good phone at this price point. I have been using for last 10 days.Pros:Good camera - provided some samples hereCrystal clear AMOLED display. There is no Green Tint issue, at least with my phone.765g processor enables the gaming and overall phone experience to be seamless. There is no lag while gaming.ConsBattery optimization could have been better. I have been using op5 which has 3800mah and it provides better battery optimization. Battery on Nord lasts approx a day on normal usage and burns in 13-14 hours with heavy gaming and videos.Missing audio jack, though the phone provides hd sound output on Bluetooth headphones.Overall pretty good phone provides top of the line performance at decent price range. One plus oxygen ui makes the experience hassle free and amazing. Should definitely go for it.

  Product is good ...but sum issues with this ...1)Such as battery draining is so fast it's gives 6/7 hrs battery backup at one charge...2)Also the draining is more on standby mode .. 10% at 10 hrs 3) Important to  required improvement of low light selfie & rear camera performance it's  very dull ...not even understand the performance of low light camera such as it may be seeing like budget category devices such as 10k to 12k phone performance ,It is very  dispointig for me ....4) Also It may sum networks flactuation issue having with this deviceWhenever using social media data can't feed immediately  don't know actually withe the divice problem or may be sum network operators issue but I face with this device only ...5) Nowadays Another one issue I face that. There is sum of delay when finger print lock also on face unlock opening.. sum application  takes sum seconds to opening the apps.I suggest to one plus required to sort out Such issue as soon as possible with future OTA updates as soon as possible it's very mandatory ..After the solved this problem phone is good &  value for money üëç

"
"

  This phone is best for users who want a phone for normal usage and maximum lasting.Pros are 5G capable which makes future proof, good gaming experience, oxygen os UI, 30 watt charger, best in display fingerprint scanner as there is no lag, amoled display with 90hz refresh rate, alert slider and bloatware free.Cons are below average camera experience, average battery life, plastic frame, average speaker quality as it not stereo speakers, and dual front camera which makes problem while watching films and games.Final verdict : If you want a future proof phone and is a normal user, it is the best phone under 30k. If you are interested in photography or gaming, please buy phones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 series chipset (for gamers) and take iPhone, Samsung Galaxy Note or S series or Google Pixel series (for photography).

  Earlier it was pathetic in term of Night shots,Macro and battery backup.But due to regular updates of Oxygen interface all things are improved,Nightscape shots are even better without grains ,Best part I love is Portrait mode ..it gives more details and colors into image like 85mm dslr lens, Although iam not selfie addict but dual selvie camera is good for Vedio call or online classes even in low light gud Vedio quality in online sessions . But failed at Macro point, even iam not able to use external macro lens because back cameras are near to each other ,will try on selfie camera.later if it works.Wrap charging is awesome almost in less than 30.min full charged..Rest internal features are also unique , Now i have no regret

  ¬†I am having a great experience in using oneplus nord as my primary device. I have attached few of the camera samples you can check them out to get the accurate idea about the quality it delivers. Talking about battery life, i agree that its not that good but after the update power consumption is improved to a great extent and the result is visible as well ( u can have a look on the ss attached ..)Battery life - 9 hours of screen on time  with moderate usage ( including asphalt 9 ,youtube Instagram , and normal day to day surfing )Coming to build quality yes it does have plastic frame but i can assure you of the premium feel while holding it but still you have to put it in the cover almost all the time to ensure safety.Conclusion - Each and everything is moderate about nord including the price.

  Ordered the phone on 20th and received the same on 24th, the product was perfectly sealed, Used the phone or 24 hours now and the review for the phone is as followspros:1. Good battery life: Charged the phone yesterday night and until 11 am today the phone is still at 60%, overall happy with the battery life2. Full-screen display: the 6.4"" display gives you amazing viewing experience.3.Rear camera: The rare camera does an absolutely fantastic job both in daylight and at night. I was actually mesmerized by the nightscape mode, though it feels that the photo was captured in daylight it does an amazing job.4. fingerprint sensor and face lock is quite apt and fast5. Tint issue: I didn't find any tint issue on my phoneCons:The only drawback for me is the front camera but I guess oneplus will resolve the problem. The problem is after zooming, the pictures appear to be grainy, if you are viewing it on a normal mode you won't see the issue, it is only seen if you zoom in.That's the only problem I haveOverall the phone is worth every penny and I'm happy to have it

  first of all I would like to give spoiler alert:It's not a perfect midrange phonecons:not a beastnot so fast(but suits for daily usage)battery stand by is above meanpros:execellnt UIgood ram managementvibrant displayhandy and compactExperience:basically I bought this device on a sole purpose to experience one plus feel.clean and stock ui grabbed my attention (as its the most legible os skin in android) .I had an issue with unlocking . finger print is decent but face unlock fails to work some times (not every one experiences it.. cause mine is a low lit area)as nord supports 5G it's a future proof phone but not truly(cause we are uncertain of 5G arrival-buying this for mere 5G is like waiting for a ship at an airport)I like the while packing case cause its a premium fell to openüòÇNORD can compete with other competitors like realmex3 pro/Samsung M51PS:IF U ARE NEW TO THE WORLD OF ONEPLUS (as they say so) This will start your journey with them smoothlyplot twist: THIS IS NOT A PAID REVIEW

  I normally don't give -ve reviews but had bad experience with Nord. On delivered day I applied for return/replace the product bcz it was not charging at all and micro usb port got disabled on its own. This could be issue with software or hardware but didn't expect from one plus. Thankfully Amazon troubleshooting app detected it and I could returned the product. Please try charging phone first before login into Google.I have not experienced this kind of issue with phones I have used like motorolla,samsung,redme,lenovo.Hope others wouldn't be getting such issues and if you experienced something like it after replacement policy is over then I think phone needs to be given in one plus service centre and it would be headache for us.

  Writing this review after almost a month of use. I was so happy with 1+6 that I thought of buying 1+Nord. But I am very disappointed with the performance of Nord. I feel camera quality of 1+6 is much better than Nord. I had faced issues with Google Map as location was not correctly showing in Nord. Google assistant, which is default app in Nord, automatically start after some intervals. Battery life is also not so good.

"

  I have been using Nord since 5 days. Seems to be pretty much good.Pros :Display - Amoled display with refresh rate of 90Hz makes the display very smooth.OS - The oxygen OS is by far the best user friendly OS.Battery Life - Battery life is pretty descent. With refresh rate set to 60 Hz and normal use, (Social media apps and camera) the battery lasts for 8 - 9 hours (Screen usage time).Warp Charge - Charges from 0-100 in 52 minutes and 15-100 in 46-48 minutes.Processor - Phone doesn't lag a bit (No heavy gaming) Snapdragon 765g is powerful.Camera - Videography seems to be good.Cons :Camera - Out of the 4 camera(rear) only the main camera and Wide angle camera are good. Macro and the other camera are below average. Images are blurry with macro mode. If you're enough patient, click photos with pro mode.Design - The plastic body of the Nord makes this less safe and less durable.Finger print reader - In display finger print reader works on optical sensor which not fast.Pretty much more than the budget mid rangers also a little less than the flagships.

  All rounderAll Good expect Macro and depth sensor, however main 48 camera sensor and front 32 sensor both are great and wide angle is okiesh.OnePlus Default dialer and messaging apps are missing which is disappointing.

  Amazing mobile but very disappointing thing is automatic call recording is missing

  This is one of the worst mobile I selected in Amazon . I bought it just not even week completed.I was using 6 gb ram mobile before using this .I didn't really felt of 12 gb ram speed of this Nord mobileApps are very slowEven some of system appps respond very slowEven when I accept the call the call duration also starts at directly from 00:05 very very lagI am not sure whether I got defective peice from Amazon or even one plus Nord is failure model I selected.Finally I would not suggest this Nord mobile for now .Even I reported same to Amazon customer service and they told technician will come and check mobile even Amazon didn't sent any one in schduled time .And one more time I again raised for concern.Finally Amazon also not actually taking customer concerns not soon.Atleast they are not at all following up with me.The MOST WORST CHOICE I MADE IS TO BUY MOBILE FROM AMAZON WHAT I THINK AND THT TOO 30 THOUSAND MOBILE I BOUGHT AND NO PROPER CARE TAKEN BY AMAZON FOR NOW.THIS IS VERY VERY BAD

  A lot of thought has gone into every single component of the phone and it's evident while using it. The phone is buttery smooth and feels rather premium. This goes to show that that specs don't matter as much if you focus on delivering a killer user experience. That being said, my device has a touch of green tint when the background is grey but it's nothing major and it's only there of you are looking for it.

"
"

  There is much hype about the product but not upto the mark.1. Battery drains very quickly2. feels heavy than my previous mobile (Oppo real me, sorry for comparing but its true)3. Hanging frequently4. dial pad is very short even though the screen is 6+ inches5. Setting up and naming alarm is not available6. Thumb unlock is not as good as its mentioned7. The charger adopter looking like a stabilizer (heavy and big)8. There are other defects too, i will keep addingBut one plus should pay me for the defects i observed and making the product next version better. ;)

"
"

  Overall, it's a very good phone ... Charging is pretty fast,the in display fingerprint sensor is also very reliable.The battery back up is decent.On normal usage it will last a full day.Software experience is great due to the clen ,stock Oxygen OS...The macro camera is not at all great.If you want to take a close up shot then just take a photo from from the main camera and then just crop all the way in.The camera is somewhat good.But the nightsight mode is amazing ,if you keep the phone steady ,then the results are amazing. But if you want you can also install gcam, the gcam  photos are pretty detailed and the dynamic range is also very good ...

"
"

  Amazon delivered the product before the promised date. Packaging was good and exchange of my old phone took place without any hassle. Coming to NORD, it came with preinstalled apps such a as amazon, prime, Netflix and so on. Front cam could have been better as it‚Äôs not showing up true colors and contrast after the pic is clicked. 2 np Macro lens behind is useless. Amoled screen is very very good and sharp images and videos are displayed when you have a high speed broadband. Although I‚Äôm against Chinese brands, I did not have choice in the budget I had and Nord sort of checked all the boxes for me. Any non-Chinese brand coming up with good specs in limited budget then am all go for it. Until then will use Nord. Overall rating: 4 of 5

"
"

  Well missing basic features of parallel app, no dual Sim, missing call recording although some video claim but unable to see sweeping left right. Phone is also bulky, using 5T for a long time and not impressed with it. It may be a good one for new phone users but a clear cut in features of a good premium phone. I am trying to return the phone but Amazon arrange a technician to visit to check missing dual Sim, parallel app and recording features. A clear no go from my side. Yes may be good for a first time buyer

"
"

  First i have many expectations on nord,may be  because of those expectations i am not so satisfied with the product.but for this price u can try other mobiles. I couldn't listen my phone ring if i am little far away from it.but when I play songs in it,the sound quality is good enough.as the ram is 12 gb its fast enough.when its about cam quality not as good as flagship phones. The micro lens is  not at all good as its just 2mp.Those who want to own oneplus but have less budget can go with this but have to sacrifice some considerations like camera quality...,ring quality.This review was written after using it for one month. The battery life is awesome after its fully charged it can be used continuously for 6 to 7 hours..and it also take very less to time charge as its a warp charging.27% charged in 10 mins nearly(23 to 50)

"
"

  All my patience has paid off to me!! This is an excellent phone from OnePlus and with affordable price. Features are as always very user friendly, look and feel is premium, sound quality is decent biometric scanner is perfect. I used an OTG to connect external hard disk and it worked lightening fast to navigate through my folders/files. I have used OnePlus 3 earlier and was very happy with that phone but it lacked OTG access in terms of access speed. This phone has overcome that shortfall.  Overall, yet again a very good phone by OnePlus.

"
"

  Overall the phone is good. I think there is some battery issue... battery drains rapidly... after full charge it last for only 15 hr with normal usuage.I not even play high graphics game like pubg, call of duty etc if I do so then how long battery last I doubt.

"
"

  I was using oneplus6, thought it would be an upgrade with not much investment. On the contrary i felt i've downgraded. Otherwise a good phone for first time oneplus users who r planning spend 25-30k. Very poor camera, either oneplus is cheating by saying its the same camera from oneplus8 or oneplus 8's camera is very poor. Did'nt feel quality and sturdiness. My initial plan was to sell my oneplus 6, but i ended up selling the new nord, You can imagine the resentment i had after buying oneplus NORD.....I recommend oneplus users not buy NORD, INSTEAD go for oneplus 8/7/7T.

  I was looking for a budget phone under 30k after analysing some of the model finally I ordered OnePlus Nord  Amazon delivery was amazing delivered the product one day beforePros1. Good display really enjoying 90hrz refresh rate it's make a good feel when you watch Netflix hd movies2. Main features I loved most is OnePlus UI it's very clean and crisp compares other Android phone UIs ( Samsung and other Chinese phones)3. Processing is pretty decent not felt any lag or freezing issue ( not a gamer mostly uses office applications and social media and online streaming apps)4. Built quantity is very good you can feel it when you hold the phone , very good weight balance as per the size of the screen5. No heating issue while long duration calls and online meeting sCos1. OnePlus is Chinese company.  as I said I was looking for below 30k phone and I don't find any better suit in the market I have tried Samsung m30s and a51 in couple of weeks but both phone has lot of issue including software bugs and heating issue

  No product is perfect and the same applies to this phoneColour shifiting in display is very prominent and annoying when viewing content in white backgroundLoud speaker is loud but lacks clarity and punchFingerprint sensor is unreliable sometimesCamera is good but not the bestVibration motor is lacking qualityEverything other than these are goodGood smooth display, software, reliable performance, Good one day battery life for an average user etc.

"

  Amazon delivered before the delivery date.Phone is amazing and upto the expectation.Writing review just 3 days after receiving.Looks, specs and performance is awesome.Recommended purchase.

  Fingerprint is best never seen before such great fingerprint . Battery life I will rate 4 star sit could better then that. Camera quality 4 stars. It‚Äôs worth for money best in look . Best in processor. That‚Äôs what we need in one mobile. Together it‚Äôs worth to be a Nord.

"
"

  Costly as per Indian market as oneplus charging 5k extra for their brand name .My bottomline is price if you are oneplus lover than go for it . Most of review by certified buyer's are almost true about camera , performance and battery are average and 5 G is Future till than there will be lot of coming in Indian market.6G 199998GB  2299912GB 24999

"

  Simple and direct review! The phone is so perfect about everything, from battery to performance! Its true thats its a well balanced phone!The only problem is that it doesn't work that good in low light photography, especially for selfie. I personally purchased this because of camera bcoz I'm so socially active and I was disappointed with low light thing!thats it! Overall its the coolest phone you will have so go for it!

"
"

  Nothing outstanding for the price. Okayish phone for a slightly steep price.Feels a bit heavy in the hand. In screen fingerprint reader not a good as a physical one. Awkward aspect ratio. Slightly on the taller side doesn't make for a good viewing experience. Can skip this one.

"
"

  The phone battery charges just 20% after 2 hours of charging.  While other features are fine, we understand there's an issue with this particular set.  We have, on multiple occasions, put requests for technician to visit and assess the phone set.  For first visit, the technician came suggested to let the phone drain completely. The second technician wrote back an incorrect report, while confirming us a replacement in 2-3 days.  The third technician closed the request without ever visiting.This has become a harrasment leading us to believe that this is a scam, where in, knowingly Amazon and the vendor are taking no steps to replace a faulty set.

  Gives premium look burt side is plastic ( don't know about qualiy)Smooth display and geat osFingerprint and face lock works fine( some brightness issue during lock)Primary and front camera takes good picturesWide angle gives an average picDon't use depth, just to shoe the camera count( worst)5g future ready but there is no use as of todayWorks fine with normal games there is no lackSingle speaker doesn't sounds greatNo heating and display issuesBattery lasts for one day with normal use and charging is fasterGood phone for normal useWon't suit for extreme users like gaming and cameras

"

  Reviewing after 2 days. It's good budget phone. But better than MI Realme Samsung.Might be they brands can give you more features in this range. But we all know all brands mobile performance slow after 1 year.But it's one plus brand it runs smoothly even after 2 year.Now pointing on this Nord -Back cemera is good but front cemera could be more better.Battery is pretty good not too. Because 90HZ phone so battery drain sure will.If you customize your mobile in 60 HZ so ur battery gives more life.Speaker so good.Bluetooth connectivity amazing.Ram adjustment nicely.Handy phone, smart access. Look premium.Overall I'll give 4 star.Main things that phone customization is too good.Best for multitasking.No heating issue.One thing I'll clear now. Whenever u buy new phone and then do on that phone. Every phone will heat first time or 1 days at least because their parts are start now to run. So don't tremble for heating issue.

"

  Writing a review after using this OnePlus Nord for 5 days high usage.First of all it's look like premium mobile (ignore frame as most of users will use protective case). In normal usage it gives about 1.5 day battery usage and in high usage it gives approx 1 day battery backup. I didn't notice any issue regarding display even in very low and high brightness as many of users reported.Pros.1. Battery backup is awesome2. Looks premium3. Smooth display4. Camera is good5. No bloatwares & ads6. No stereo speaker but speaker is loud and clear7. Good video viewing experienceCons.1. Very fews apps are supported in Parallel Apps2. Camera is struggling in low light3. Depth sensor and macro sensor cameras are worst. No meaning of this sensor and I don't know why they add this camera, just for quad camera setup.I will update this review after using this device for few more days and sure update soon if I notice any issue.

  Overall OK Ok satisfaction With OnePlus Nord. Previously I am a Poco F1 user I downgrade in Processer segment to nord because of its features likeIn display fingerprintAmoled DisplayFast Charging Compared To poco F1 it is impressiveAnd Mostly it's a 5G phoneHere is My overall Opinion about this PhoneFor this Budget OnePlus Best in it segmentDon't Expect Camera like 8 pro or somethingThe camera performance is ok but not up to the mark, it loss it's details may be any updates will improve the performance wait for itMacro camera total use lessI shot some pics with 48 mp camera I attached here are look better compared with macro camera.When you see normal preview it's ok with all pictures but whever you try to zoom in to pictures u will notice noise in every picture even it's a daylight picExcept camera Everything is superbI notice phone fully charged in 1 hrI Give 50 marks out of 100

  Display Issue: The phone (Nord, 12 GB / 256 GB) was working fine till 3 weeks, yesterday suddenly one white line appeared in the center of the phone and heated up.  After reboot the phone screen is now red in colour and phone heat is very high. I saw several screen issues for the Nord phone. So please check before you buy.Support Issue: When I tried to contact the support number (4 times I tried) which was not attending even after waiting for 15+mins, no reply from support mail box and after waiting 20 mins in support chat I could talk to a executive and he told me to visit nearest service center which is 80km far from here. Online support is very worst and support centers are less. If you are not in a metro town / city, please check the service center availability before you buy the phone.

  Writing this review after 2 months of usagePros :1. Great display2. Decent Battery life (7-8 hrs of Screen on time with moderate usage)3. 30W fast charging is real bliss4. Almost No lag in performance5. Clicks great pictures in good lighting conditions6. Call quality is pretty good7. Looks Premium and has got nice weight balancing8. Clean Oxygen OS9. Great RAM managementCons :1. Facing serious Bluetooth connectivity issue...  The unavailability of 3.5mm jack is making it worse.. hopefully it'll get fixed in future updates2. Macro camera is unusable.No screen tinting issue found in my deviceYeah... So if you're a moderate user who doesn't really need very high end processor go for it.

  Really fantastic mobile... After using it 3=months writing this review... Charging wrap is excellent... back up so good and performance unbeatable... Camera so good... Waiting for updates to Android 11... Thereafter we can not justify the performance may be unbelievable in soon... One plus Nord will be the most beautiful mobile for middle rangers... But it needs to update camera features... Is looking like just warm pics it's taking in my experience... This might be resolved in Android 11 I believe.... THANK YOU ONE PLUS NORD....nice to have you in my hand and becoming a part of my life...,üëçüëçüëçüëç

  Writing this review after 2-3 days of uses. I have purchased OnePlus for the first time and let's say i can feel the difference between sub 20k phone and a mid range phone like Nord. It gives a touch of premium phone, oxygen OS works smooth. I am a normal user and use it mostly for calling and social media browsing, as if now phone has performed smoothly. Apps work smooth, Camera quality is also good compared to my past Samsung and mi phones. Sound quality is good, fingerprint sensor works smooth, warp charging works well and you can have a 50% battery in 30 minutes charging. Will write more detailed review after using it for couple of months.

  Very disappointed with delivery , I placed pre order on 28th July & received the package after 15 days , very poor delivery experience People who ordered on 06th August that too with 10% discount in price has recently v d product in 3 days,  When contacted Amazon clarifies that shipment is based on delivery date & not order date .This is a major flaw in their systemProduct : it's an average product don't expect too much as it was hyped , Display is ok & watching movies want that great , refresh rate is ok , camera quality is not bad but it would have been better , for 28k it's overly priced accept 5G spec , it's in par with 15k Realme XT

"
"

  Amazing product. One plus nord. I was sceptic about buying this initially but thought of giving a shot. Trust me , the product is amazing. Performance and camera is awesome. Battery life could have improved a bit as I feel the battery drains quickly in idle time. It was 73 percent in the night when I stopped using the phone and when I woke up in the morning , it was showing 52. So 21 percent was the idle drain of the battery in the night. Not happy with this alone. Hope One Plus will come up with an update to solve this issue.Apart from this I am totally happy and satisfied with this product.Thanks Amazon and thanks One Plus.I got this Special Edition in the Amazon Great Indian Sale and trust me, this color is the best when compared to the other two colors.

"
"

  I order the device in Amazon around 6th of August and got the Device on 19th August..Till date I have received 2 ota updates 1 during the day I have unbox and the last one few days back...CAMERA: The camera of this device Is far better than my previous device,Captures decent photographs through primary camera and Depth camera I think is of no use because I have tried clicking photos multiple times covering the depth sensor of the device but that didn't help..The primary camera gets the work done relating to portrait images.. I don't understand why they gave the quad camera set up.. Macro camera performance is below average according to 28k phoneDisplay: Very smooth in 90HZ refresh rateBattery:improved after the update I got few days backPerformance:It is great according to me no lag(well I don't play Pub-g)Well a very decent device according to the need..If the update fixes issue of the camera it will be very helpful

"

  Just after 2-3 days it started hanging and most of the app gets crashed and phone gets rebooted automatically.  Battery back up is also very poor. when i contacted the customer care of oneplus, they sent some setups but it did not work.  Then they suggested to contact service center.  I contacted service center they told that its a software problem and they reinstalled teh software.  But even after that the same problem persists.I mailed to oneplus for the replacement on which they said to contact amazon.  But in amazon it shows that return period is over.  So this is the punishment i am getting for trusting oneplus brand and after spending 30000 I am being tortured and feeling cheated.  I would once again request oneplus and amazon to replace my phone with new one or refund my money.

"
"

  1.Finger print reader and face recognition is on mark! Work ultimately and can assure that none of the phones with similar budget can't provide with same work2. Battery life is kind of average. However it can be compensated by fast warp charger which can charge within half an hr. It better to carry a charger when you travel.3. Camera quality is also kind of average. Comparatively I feel one plus 6 camera works well.4. Phone touch and performance are class like all one plus phones give.Totally, A person who needs phone casually can buy this( a good option). Its not recommendatory for those who uses phone continually with little pauses and who is kind of phone photographers.

"
"

  Please search for mobile issue in google before you buy,  there has been a ton of connectivity issues from many nord users including mine. AND NONE OF SO CALLED AUTHENTIC TECH REVEIWERS HAVE BROUGHT THIS IS INTO GENERAL PEOPLES ATTENTION.I am not recieving 4g internet speed on oneplus,  this is network coverage issue as i hv been using same sim on lg g6 which gave a super high speeed 4g connection.On top of it,  unable to connect to games like free fire,  it ahow network connection error,  but i switch to wifi,  it connects seamlessly.I am planning to return the device,  i am waiting hear back from oneplus.

  i got a defective product

"
"

  Guys, be careful with the low end phone of OnePlus.  It is keep on getting hanged.  Network getting disconnected while talking.  Wifi is not detecting many a times.I used oneplus 3t for 3 years.  Decided to upgrade with this model, but turned to be a great downgrade.  I posted in OnePlus forums.  No response.  Be cautious!Poor performance from Service center.  I have raised the complaint again.

"

  after a week of use here are some pros ans cons,cons1. no 3.5 mm jack2. sound quality is above average nt the best in range3. rear and selfie camera is quite good bt at this price range we have better option (about image quality).pros.1. video quality is awsm2. battry life is good, and can charge 20-100% in less than 40 min( charging speed mast hai)3. 765G works best, no lagging .4.screen is the best part u will notice, i mean very fluid type its jst feel like its flowing at 90htz.5. above all its very handy and looks very luxurious.6. noise cancellation tagda hai, mic is also goodin my view its one of the best phone under 30k . go for it,hype bahut tha bt aisa b nahi ki hype galat tha, go for it.üòÅüëç

"
"

  Amazing phone. Definetly go for it.Only con is that it OnePlus phones don't have memory card slot which is a major drawback.

"
"

  Overall I am satisfied with the product.The performance is amazing so is battery life. Gaming is decent. The Backside glass material is very attractive and gives you a premium feel.Here come a few minor cuts they have made, the camera is an average especially micro cam, if you compare with the recently released pixel which is of similar price rate. The display is good but not the 'The Best'. The frame material of the mobile is plastic, so be a little careful if you wanna use it without a case. These are minor issues. For a normal user, majority don't notice.But if you are a frequent or a passionate photographer, I think you would be a lit bit disappointed. Or if you a hardcore gamer, I think there are better mobiles in the market.But I can assure you that it balances all the features you want to find in today's smartphone. If you are buying in 2020 it is 'The best' overall purchase in its price range.

"
"

  After using this phone I realized that my previous phone which I bought 3 years back is much better.  2 major concerns that I found were an extremely bad camera and screen. My regular phone which has a 60hz refresh rate has a much much better display. Seems like OnePlus used some very cheap quality products and got this out so that people realize that OnePlus 8 is really worth it.

  One plus nord marble blue 128gb, which i have bought.An amazing smartphone. Oxygen os superb experience.üòç Camera - standard quality , protraits are good. Design and built quality are good. Inhand feel will get. Fingerprint, face unlock are fast enough.One thing i felt is battery drain is there as the usage . Iam not a gamer but i am using mobile for the social medias fb,insta etc . Battery drain is there , but can be charged very fastly by the warp charger. No headphone jack and sd card slot. So need to use a wirless head phn .I can say moreover about nord is that,Nord is an allrounder smart phone. I just love itüòò‚ù§Ô∏è one plus superbbbüòçüòçüòçüòç iam agreat fan of 1+üòò

  There are different displays comes with this phone and when I compared with each Oneplus Nord device (out of 3) only 1 device has brighter displays. Whilst inquiring this  issue in service center, service engineer says even after you replaced the screen the issue persists  and you have  to adjust with it . Even the display spare in service center has faulty one and tricks will be played by saying yellow tint .I presume that 1 in 100 device comes with display fault.Furthermore ,heating and battery drain issues are significantly higher even after normal apps usage ( W/O games,video calls, camera).Compromise has been made in the display segment , when you try to read any pdf documents you will come to know that . In my suggestion Oneplus Nord in July Batch manufactured phones has serious hardware issues and the company has tried to solve with software and the results failed after  trying with serious of updates10.5.3, 10.5.5, 10.5.6, 10.5.8.

  I am giving my honest review after 1 week1)The camera is super awesome far far best from my expectations,at first i was also confused whether the camera wiill be good or not...but trust me the selfie and rear camera are performing as oneplus 8 (as my freind also use OnePlus 8 so i have compared)2.even when i use the phone in 60Hz it feels like i am using in 90 hz its too smooth in 60hz to  No doubt the phone is super awesome idk why people are giving bad review3.THERE IS NO GREEN TINT ISSUE AT ALL

  Nice Product.Review After using 8 Days.Pros:* Amoled Display is awesome.* Fingerprint Reader works super fast.* Battery Life is very good. Normal usage it can use upto 1.5 Days.* Camara Quality good both front and Back.( Portrait, Normal Photo, Nightscape, PRO mode) Update immediately received for Camara Quality Improvement.* PUBG/COD No lagging upto HD.* If u r a Gamer Use fnatic mode for better gaming performance.* Phone Looks Premium.* Call Quality is good.Cons:* PUBG/COD light heating while played in HD.* Auto Call recording option not available.* Contact Search Option need improve.Oveall Good Phone in this price and Segment 12GB RAM and 256GB Memory.

"
"

  *Very disappointed with camera, macro camera not working properly. Front camera gives more bright pic which looks high contrast.*Videography is excellent with same camera......*Waiting for camera updates from oneplus community.....

"
"

  Overall specification worth to the price as compare to same budget mobiles.. No issues with mobile camera is good and display is working smooth.. but facing network issue..  after every 5-6 hours network automatically gone.. every time need to put sim into sim tray.

"
"

  Using it for about 3days, i didnot face any battery draining issues, but i came accross green and purple tint when I use it on night mode,but it's not a big deal for me bcz I don't use dark mode much! Coming to gaming I played pubg it ran fine and there is no heating issues while gaming!Cameras are good but still have to be the best as they mentioned!Display is gorgeous and looks premium while holding it on hands(Plastic frame u may not notice that)Coming to oxygen os is the best Ui I had ever used, it is smooth, snappy and well optimized! Oxygen os coupled with 8Gb of ram and that 90hz amoled panel makes the device fast and smooth... Overall for daily drivers it is the best device at that price!

"
"

  The Nord disappointed me at the beggining, but with every update the phone started showing its true potential. With a decent battery life, which is not a problem because of the Dash Charge the phone works fine throughout the day. The main camera is the USP of this device, which works perfectly fine for me, (have a attached a few images testing the various features of the camera) the remaining cameras are also showing improvement with each update, but it may take some time to be as perfect as the main 48MP camera taken from the OnePlus 8. Overall the phone is near to perfect at this price point and the 12GB RAM + 256GB space is definitely a banger packed in a beautifully crafted phone.

"
"

  Overall its a good product with little tweaks here and there.Very much sufficient and smooth for normal usage.For camera, the main 48 MP sensor is good. I was able to get some good quality pictures in good lighting. The front camera is also really good.An unnecessary 2MP macro camera.Face Unlock is quick, but the Fingerprint reader is a bit slow.During the first usage after unboxing, the phone heated up pretty significantly, but the problem subsided during succesive uses and now its runs with a minimum heating.Battery life is good enough to get you through a 9-10 hr screen time ( not gaming) and the 30W warp charger delivers as promised.At low brightness in dark background there is a purple tint on the bottom part of the display. But its not that bad, and is not visible while watching videos or other media content.

"
"

  I always dreamed about owning a one plus device and one plus had my dream come true.Took a long time time to get my phone but it was worth the wait.Had no tint issue or any other complaints,I think they have fixed these issues in the coming phones.90 hz refresh is so smooth,camera quality is great except for the macro camera but no big deal.Have some improvements to me made in the camera department and one plus is working on it.Gaming was smooth and one plus has guaranteed a higher settings in pubg in their future updats.Amalod screen is great.Got two updates.Battery back up has improved,also improved night shots of front camera.Oxegen OS is the best part no ads and smooth experience with good customisations and features.I know it's frame is made out of plastic but doesn't feel cheap.Will be updating more details regarding this phone.Its a balance phone.Perfect for all useü•∞ü•∞ü•∞.By the way thank you Amazon and One plus

  Camera clearity not good very blur pic.on front camera n back camera nd bettry life not gud

"
"

  Worst Choice Google dialer and messages instead of Oneplus Pack.Average CameraMacro shots are disappointing.Good DesignDisplay Awesome.Ok Processor.This is my first One-plus, disappointed.

"
"

  Overall a good phone. Nothing unique, above average battery life, decent user experience and good display. The tint can be noticed when something dark grey appears, like a blank chrome page. When something absolutely black appears, no tint issue can be noticed. The camera is good, primary, wide and front. Pictures are colour accurate and detailed but sometimes turn out  to be a bit over exposed and white balance is inconsistent. I tried using Gcam, it produced a better results comparatively. But the OnePlus camera at its own is still good. The fingerprint reader is fast enough and face ID too. You will need to unlocks some features for more smoother experience. I will definitely recommend this phone for content consumption, camera and casual gaming.

"
"

  Just got the device today in the afternoon - it's been a beast so far :D.Fingerprint reader works fine, and I'm yet to completely test the battery life. The 90Hz AMOLED display is a sweet addition to this device for this price point.The Onyx Gray looks and feels premium, atleast for the sub-30k price point. And the 12GB of RAM nakes the phone blazing fast, atleast fresh out of the box.The packaging beats the likes of premium OnePlus devices, and the mix of Black and Teal is a welcome combination.So far, it's been a good experience with this device.

  For me its a budget friendly phone..I think it is the king of mid ranger phone... That is I used many mid ranged phone .. but I didn't got this much performance.The camera quality is above average and battery life is perfect for movie lover, normal use like calling, wsp, insta, etcFingerprint reader is so fast and awesomeIn my opinion if you have 30k rs you should look for the high variant of 12GB/256GB RAM and internal storage respectively.. Also didn't face any tint issue or bluetooth, wifi issues that are just gimmicks.. Just go buy yaar you will love it..

  Honest review after almost 2 months usage.PROSExcellent blotfree smooth software. Works like charm.Battery life is OK but wrap charge is fabulous.Screen quality is also excellent.In display finger print scanner is also good, no lagging.CONSNO CALL Recording. Since it is loaded with Google dialer, it is not having automatic call recording. If one needs to record, one need to press button while call and other person will also know, call recording has started. For me it is single most worse feature.Old oneplus phones had inbuilt recording feature.Second big disappointment is camera quality is not fabulous but normal quality. My old Samsung A7 2018 phone was better in camera quality.

  Display1. Good amoled display with 90hz refresh rate,but not the best in this price segmentCamera1. good shots with the primary camera in all lighting conditions2. Descent wide angle shots, most of the times images are pretty soft3. Primary 32mp selfie camera is average, overexposes the image, ultrawide camera is useful4. No need to mention the remaining two cameras, straight up trashCharging is speed is very good, full charge around 1hrBattery lasts more than a day with 90hz mode765g Processor is good enough, multitasking is a breeze, don't know how it works with gamingBig thumbs up for oxygen OS, clean software experience

  Received the product in 4 days.The product got so much hype that I was forced to buy this. Especially this blue marble colour with glass at the back is so mesmerizing.Good battery life, i just charge it once in a day and it goes on with moderate usage.30W charging just makes it charge 70% in 35 minutes approx.Camera quality is awesome but micro camera and depth sensor is just a waste. They could have applied that cost in making ultrawide better but after considering all the facts, the phone is worth a buy for this cost you are getting a good brand good battery life, 48mp main camera which makes your experience better, especially 5g support and chipset does not make you feel behind any flagship model. Also it shows a very good quality in nightscape mode.So its a buy rating from my end but I am giving 4 stars bcz of micro camera.

"
"

  I was very much excited to get this product, but I'm feeling bad for choosing this mobile as it has more cons than pro's.Camera quality is very bad, the first thing I did after switching on the phone was to click a picture and was very much disappointed with the image captured. A cheaper phone would take nicer pictures. Also the image saving takes a second or so gap, so finding it difficult to capture moving objectsApps are hanging a lot while using multiple applications at same time. Screen is getting frozen for few seconds (15-20) and as a fast hand person I feel very much frustrated.Not a mobile expected from one plus. I fell for the brand name, and it's a life time lesson.I don't recommend this mobile if you expect good speed and good camera quality. Other than these features I didn't expect anything else from one plus brand.

"
"

  I trusted oneplus for future updates for camera hence i haven't returned the nord mobile. They provided the update but whats the use. Iam expecting atleast oneplus 5t camera quality in this nord. Please don't let us use gcam mod, we all buying your mobile mainly for stock camera.Expecting future camera updates or else i will broke my nord to make video because of camera disappointment.

"
"

  Loving the phone, good screen quality with 90hz refresh rate and good finger print reader, camera quality is also good. loving the experience. speak design with good haptics. just go for it.

"
"

  Phone looks super premium in hand, This phone is good for the people who aren't heavy gamers, 0 bloatwares, 90hz refresh rate amoled display is super smooth. Brightness is really good, camera image processing is little late can be fix through updates, oxygen os is the best thing in OnePlus phones one can get, charging speed is super fast can fully charge phone in less than 1 & half hour. Overall it's awsum....

"
"

  One plus Nord is really an impressive phone with a relly good price.The camera is amazingThe only thing that lags this phone is the battery life which is quite fine but could have been a lot better.Fingerprint scanner is Okay.You really can say that -This phone is everything you could ask for at a really good price.

"
"

  I'm getting some software issue , phone automatically get root mode for long time .within 6 days it happens twice with me, don't expect this type of issues from OnePlus. I'll recommend to wait till this issue resolved.Very very very disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è

"
"

  It is very good product in this price range. I am using from last 30 days but it never hanged and camera is good. Very smooth operation compared to same price mobiles. Fast charging is very good technology it is having. It will take only 30 min for full charge. Overall experience for me is very good and I will give 4.5 rating after 30 days of high use and no heating issues till now. Compact mobile in our hand. Only issue is battery draining but fast charge is there no worry at all.

"
"

  Overall nice phone.Meets the expectations as shown in Amazon display page.Only limitations is absence of 3.5 mm jack for head fones.So had to buy seperate type c to 3.5 mm connenctor although it can work with Bluetooth headphones.One+ should provide 3.5 mm jack.Fingerprint reader is too fast.Display,processer is nice and enjoyed playing Call of duty absolutely fine at HDR.Battery life is good and warp charger gives you instant charging as promised.Camera quality is good atleast better than other Chinese products.Overall satisfied with this product and recommended to buy.

"
"

  This phone is having serious network issue.Everytime i could see while playing online games or searching on browser, it shows network connection lost so i had to switch on and off flight mode to recover the network. Thanks to Amazon that they had refunded my money

"
"

  This is my first experience with One plus and If I talk about camera of this phone than you gonna absolutely love this if you like well saturated pics in day light .photos are eye pleasant and nightmode is also working good . Processor and the speed of this phone is well balanced battery life is also  good but as the company claims about the phone charging speed then there is issue cz it doesn't charge with speed as compared to other OnePlus phones but that is tolerable. Otherwise I am satisfied with this device and I m loving it .

"
"

  Oneplus nord mobile is total wrost product because of it battery backup is too wrost totally disappointed product i try to return this product but there is no any option at Amazon to return the product i also complain in oneplus service center but there are also not help me to return product Noone company oneplus and Amazon try to respond my issue and return my mobile and refund my total amount.

"
"

  Nothing much in hardware other than gorilla glass finish and Nord blue skin but software part is pretty awesome . Apt for regular use . Not fit for heavy use . Auto brightness is not so accurate . Camera is let down as said by many people . Battery not so great but fast charging is bit relief .  765G processor is decent enough for regular use . If you have trust on Oneplus you can biy .

"
"

  For the price of 29,999 , it really performs well . Till date I don't face any lag . Oxygen OS is cool . Camera quality is superb (excluding macro camera) "" There's no screen tint issues "" as rumoured . So dont worry about screen tinting . Thing I hate about the oxygen os is you can't record an ongoing call without the other person knowing that  you're recording their call . Because when you press record call it's says ' The call is being recorded ' both to you and the other person on the call too ! It's annoing . OnePlus should fix this issue .Battery life is descently good . Gaming performance is also good (smooth 60FPS) . But games do drain battery faster than expected . Charing speed is literally mind-blowing . I appreciate it ! Overall it's a TopNotch Budget OxygenOS phone . I recommend BUYING one for sure

"
"

  Not up to the Mark,Auto Call Recording not availableVoice not clear to other person callingSwitch between in ear speaker and loud speaker /Bluetooth speaker not happeningGetting hanged some timeSome google applocations auto closing like you tubeCamera app getting automatic closed

"
"

  What can I say it's amazing.Sensor isr super quickBattery life is not badCharges super quickMusic volume is greatGreat for watching movies as screen quite huge and clearThere no headphone jack so for that separate is neededCamera is quite good

"
"

  1) All is well except below issue.Issue: I have two sim cards of jio operator in my phone, on daily basis after 24 hours of usage phone goes in no network condition, it can recover only through 2 ways, by rebooting the phone aur put phone in in flight mode and then again flight mode off.This is very irritating issues and it is happening from the day one in my phone.From such high price phone  i did not expect such basic network issues are exist while network is the like basic functionality of phone it should be working fine.I used to miss calls or SMS always when my phone is in no network condition.

"
"

  Yesterday I got NORD.Super fast charging (full charge takes just 30mins)Super battery backup (It lasts more than a day - for heavy user)Camera clarity is good in front and back.Speakers are loud.Touch is too good.Over all it is a great mobile in budget.But, I fed up with Amazon ..  I booked on 5th Aug, I received in Yesterday. It takes 11 days to deliver.

"
"

  Camera is not good , it's an average,when you click photo you have to wait for some moments to then you see photo is clear but you click and instantly see the photo you found the photo is blurAlso quality of the photo is not good,you say it's an averageLow light photo it's click worst photoFront camera is also not satisfied me@battery life not good you have to charge two times a day ,for single charge it only goes 6-7 hoursThat's the reason why I gave camera nad battery 3 star starI only hope one plusAt least camera could perform well after giving updates

"
"

  Updating my review after 45days of usage.Pros:1) Awesome look and feel2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate3) Sound quality is good4) Premium design5) Fast on screen Fingerprint scanner6) Quick charging7) No heating issuesCons:1) Average camera -- not expected at this price range (28K)2) No support to headphones Jack (now a days everyone is using bluetooth devices so its not a big issue)3) No led notification light4) Battery backup is low (Highly not recommended for gamers)

"
"

  * Battery : Initial days the battery was draining really fast but with continuous updates from OnePlus my battery lasts for atleast a day* Camera : About the camera I see many comments stating that the quality is not good but In my opinion due to the updates given by OnePlus the camera quality has improved and it's best* Finger print sensor is fast* There no display issues like tint*Best ram managementConclusion:  OnePlus has done 283 optimization and it is continuing to do the optimization so in my opinion oneplus has the best service and they listen to their customers every time !Overall it's a best phone

"
"

  So I have bought this phone straight after my one plus 6 experience. This is the phone which I was looking to buy. Firstly I loved the color as it looks preety cool(my fav as well). Talking about the phone I am really loving it each & every day. No doubt about the quality & also the storage is Good. Camera quality is great with a different level of experience. If you are looking for the best phone with a satisfying price you must go for ONEPLUS NORD ! üíô

"
"

  There's nothing's great as such.First of all I had to Wait for almost 25 days to get itüòë So first they hiked your curiosity so that you would feel like it'll be such a great phone but intact I was pretty disappointed with it. Camera is averageAnd it heats up so quickly. Battery is not enough , drains out very quickly.I just unboxed it , it was at 48 and just after 10 mins without even playing any high end content or gaming, only few clicks and lil bit browsing the juice went down to 35 , seriously.Not sure it's because of that 90 Hz refresh rate which I didn't feel anything different.Overall I would say does not meet expectations and not worth to wait for months to get it.

"
"

  Phone is decent but the price is a bit more looking at the specifications they provide on paper vs the actual performance you get.I replaced my Nord in 2 days as the display apart from showing green and pink tint even on brightness above 50 percent exhibits a dark purple patch that was affecting my daily day to day usage.You'll be lucky if your unit is not plagued by such display issues.Cameras are not even average they lack focus and clarity even in full lighting, but that can be improved via Software updates.But tinting issue can't be fixed with a software update.

"
"

  Awesome mobile in this mid range segment..Excellent display..wonderful camera..sleek and light weight design..Overall a quality product from OnePlus..Actually I don't like very big screen mobiles..Since it's a 6.44 inch..light weight..compact design...Five stars to OnePlus Nord

"
"

  I would give one star less as i find der was more colour customised notifications der in my older one plus 5 den Nord... Notification colour dot when cell is locked is biggest draw back in this handset... Rest features are same no change in one plus apart from camera upgradation n slight bigger screen n some latest modification. Disappointed on light dot notification feature which is not in current nord

"
"

  I got my delivery on 26th...so have been testing is for 4 days now...and it works absolutely fine...I didn't find any problems...(those having display tint issue they will be fixing it in next update)Camera I would rate it 4 out of 5...macro is ok and overall camera is good...with some upcoming updates it should be good EnoughPerformance wise is quick damn quick...i play PUBG a lot it there not delay at all...and the extreme setting is soon gonna come...I didn't face any issues while calling, connecting bluetooth headphone it works absolutely fineBattery is also good idk why people are saying bad battery performance but it's more than enough...and Charing it also pretty fastAnd this phone is quite handy not too big or heavy...

"
"

  Pros : -Great amoled panel with 90hz display.Bloatware free Oxygen OS with 3 years of updates.Sufficient battery. 30t warp charger.No heating issues while long hours of gaming.765g processor for smooth daily usage and gaming.Gorilla glass in front and back which gives it a premium look.Cons:-Dissapointing cameras. May be it can be fixed with further updates.Plastic frame which may lead to durability issue. This can be confirmed only after long usage (more than a year or two).No 3.5 mm jack.

"
"

  Best value for money. With frequent updates sometimes Oxygen OS becomes buggy such as Google can't connect to internet problem, Google Chrome doesn't load search results, Google Web search and define on a selected word doesn't work properly (shows no internet). These are some issues I faced, which I did not faced other phones having Google.

"
"

  I was a bit worried to buy this phone as I had never had a one plus before. My husband has a S10 and I an iPhone XS MAX. I have to say for the price I paid for this the screen is great, the speed is fantastic. The colour is one of the things that I really liked about the phone and I also got the sandstone blue case from one plus which lets me see the blue colour of my phone with some protection. The camera is alright. It hasface and fingerprint scanners. Bluetooth works well. Also it feels very light after my XS Max. Very happy with the purchase..

"
"

  I have been using this phone almost for one month now....I have one major issue...that is the image processing....it takes a while after the image is captured...if you capture and immediately move your hand, the image will be blurred...I hope one plus listens to this major drawback of this phone....otherwise it's a good midranger phone....the battery life is good not great ... fingerprint sensor sometimes doesn't identify fingerprint.... camera quality is not as great as the brand has promised but it's still good not bad actually....but I think vivo x50 which costs 35k is a better phone than one plus nord

"
"

  Received a product with too much tint issue. Greys were green and pink tinted even at 100% brightness. I returned it. The product as such without considering this issue was great. I returned this unit and got another from a local store. There is very less tint issue in my new unit. I would totally recommend it. Its fast and smooth. Also Oxygen OS is a big plus. Camera performance is also decent. More than enough for normal users.

"
"

  There's no need to waste time..in simple words..if u have used iphone in the past...or used samsung S or galxy series in the past or used a good vivo or MI or Oppo phone in the past DO not ever go for this brand. Hardware is great but smartness is zero in this phone. All it can give u is a pain in the back.....do not everrrrr go for this phone...it's waste of money n moreover ur time n many more....

"
"

  Better option available in this price range.  Very dull screen low speaker volume. An average product not happy at allPlanning to sell this on cashify.

"
"

  I booked the phone the day it was released and have been using for a week and sharing my experience below,1) Decent phone and good specs. No tint issue was scared on that front2) Camera realistically 4 wasn't required and could have been better3)Battery : As much  as it charges fast it also drains faster.Kind of neutral havent had a chance to go out a whole day or two to test its endurance .4)Used one plus 6T so OS experience nothing much to comment it is really good.5)Simple and powerful processor ,i am a normal user with phone calls ,news and video skimming so the processor and RAM is giving similar experience to that of flagship model.6)

"
"

  - I dont find appearance is great on top there is bezel which looks odd, now a days most phones dont have beezel?- battery drains fast.- Camera is average- Screen is good but noting remarkable silimar to othe rphine in this bracket.- Design is  ordinary like any other phone in segment-- there is huge hype same is not worth , one can easily find better phone in this price bracket.- fast charger wrap is good, it takes appx  1.5  hrs to charge phone.I don t find any premiumness in phone its just like any other phone, Gloss y plastic back not a welcome option, will highlight scratches.

"
"

  I have very surprised why people have written good mobile.1. Mobile have heating problem2. Camera quality very poor3. Product not as per discribed4. We are trying to return/replace the item but no one wants to listen my word, it seems that I have to bear Rs.28000/-5. Amazon Customer executives are not responding and till date they have not resolved the issue and also does not want to hear my problem.Overall mobile quality is very poor and I have purchased 1st time oneplus mobile and this is last.

"
"

  Slightly overpriced for what it offers. Unnecessary depth and macro cams at the back. Great screen and got no tint issues. Mono speaker setup is good but stereo should have been given at this price point. So in a nutshell, a nice phone that is overpriced and wayyy overhyped.PS:One plus marketing team needs to chill and not create unnecessary hype as it can quickly backfire.

"
"

  Good product , Thanks to the amazon for delivering the product on the time.

"
"

  I am not happy with this phone. With 12gb ram, it's processing is not so fast, lot of accessibility issues which you will only find in other brands. Battery falls like flowing water.. it runs down as quick as it charges back with warp charging.

"
"

  Onplus has done a great job in the Price range.Only complaint is the battery. The battery drains a lot when you do not use the phone, at night.I have used some 3rd party app to control the battery life but oneplus should resolve this issue ASAP.Everything else is just perfect.

"
"

  Pictures are blurry and grainy. Written 32 MP but it's not even clear as 6MP to 12MP. Totally upset due to camera poor quality. Back camera has no various options to filter images like any other similar flagship smart phones features. I would recommend if you want a fast operating mobile Nord otherwise, if you are looking for a best camera experience then don't try this which will waste your valuable funds....

"
"

  Super macro camera not working..plz fix it

"
"

  I usually don't write reviews but this I'll as it might help someone. Camera quality is the worst I've seen so far. Color capturing not good, something I didn't expected from giant like OnePlus. Also zoom distorts the image  With this price they should have given us good/average camera. If you want your phone camera to be good then trust me this is not the phone you should buy.

"
"

  It drains the battery very fast. It consumes 10-15% battery during your sleeping hours when not in use.During call receiving or calling someone, both the sim cards loses its connectivity. You have to try 4-5 times to call somebody. That's the most irritating thing.Camera is so so . Problem occurs during night or when there is low light.I will prefer not to buy this product.

"
"

  Upgraded from realme 1 this is first time owning a Oneplus brand phone.Booked on August 6th during prime day and received on 28th August  .Almost after 10days of usage writing this review .Looks wise amazing no doubt it will give premium feel in hand and it won't feel bulky.I am not Gamer so please don't consider my review if your preference is games. Battery performance is fine with one full charge giving day full of performance watching atleast 2 and half hrs of movie/webseries on prime or Netflix(excellent HD streaming), and not less than 1hr online video conference and some office work.Need little improvement in camera department. Sound quality also descent.Oxygen OS is very smooth and fast.Overall  experience with Nord is great.

"
"

  I am writing review after 15 days of use.first thanks to amozon for its quick delivery and that was 3 days before. I found phone very smooth and flawless. Awesome quality camera especially it's macro and it's 10 x zoom. Sound quality suprb. Charging is also very fast , thanks to its wrap charger. Obviously you will be disappointed if you compare it with one plus 7t pro or samsung 20 plus or note 10. But better than I phone 7 or 8 . You don't need to buy cover or screen gaurd as it comes along with mobile.

"
"

  Excellent experience on oxygen os...Fingerprint reader is 0.3 second delay...but not a deal breaker...As a previous budget phone user ; Cameral quality of nord is brilliant...Display tint issue is there...but not much...it is visible only at very low brightness...it is not much evident over all...Battery life is enough for one day...charging is crazy fast...over all..satisfied with the product

"
"

  I got my OnePlus Nord yesterday. The very first day I checked my phone was for the green tint issue. The following night when I checked my phone, I see no green-pink tint issue in it. Also the black bar on the top through the punch holes cameras, aren't that visible. Like they get easily hidden away unless you intentionally look for it. Others things like the fingerprint reader and battery life are good and up to mark. About camera quality, I personally would say it as okay. Not impressed very much by camera quality or maybe I need to discover it much further to explore its quality. And the 90hz screen, overall processing and haptics are all good. For me, this phone is near to perfect for which I would give it a 5 star rating.

"
"

  The oxygen os is very smooth,gaming experience is good so far ,the os is highly customisable.I didn't observe any tint issue so far.Amazon delivery was very good with neat proctective packaging.Totally a nice phone for balanced users like me.Battery lasts for 1day after full chrage I get a screen time of 6hours easily with 90hz referesh rate.No heating issues . Continuous updates are given to fix bugs.Camera captures live colours and you can take insane shots with g cam.Build quality of the phone is pretty normal so put a  full tempered and a case and use it.The only problem that is personally face is no 3.5mm audio  jackCharge speed is super fast as claimed by the company

"
"

  Purchased this on the first day of launch. Was too excited for this but experience was too bad. The phone was defective and did't switched off after first day of charging. I asked for exchange but instead Amazon seller support executive advised they don't have any stock and also asked to not go with this phone as they are getting many complaints from buyers. All in all not this was an time wasting and very bad experience. And as I have bought this on EMI I will have to bear the GST charges. I would not suggest this phone to anyone.

"
"

  ¬†I pre-ordered it and I got and I'm telling my view after good usage..Excellent phone...go for it.. features are really cool... premium experience..all the description given for the phone totally matches with the product..the only issue I've felt was the battery..charge drains a little faster in normal mode but thanks to the fast warp charge it gets charged in a very short time.camera quality is good but the macro was not good enough.. except this overall a good phone and worth the price

"
"

  Delivery: I ordered this product on the 20th of August, and it was supposed to deliver on the 29th of August. But the item was shipped on 28th, and it was delivered on 4th of September. Customer care service provided uncertain information whenever contacted. Waiting for a product for almost half a month is just a waste of time and money.After two days of using, I find the product is reliable.Camera is too good.Battery does not hold the charge even for a day.Charging speed is slower than my moto turbo.

"
"

  ¬†Over all it's a decent phone for this price. Great for someone who is looking forward to buy one plus. Oxygen OS is super smooth. One thing I really like is the filters in camera. They are doing a great job.Here are the cons I noticed:1. Front camera smoothens out everything. Images not that sharp.2. Whenever I search something on Google it shows offline though signal is quite good. If I redo the search twice or thrice it then gives the result.3. Face unlock doesn't work properly in dim light.4. Only 2 system provided font styles. One plus could have included few more fonts atleast.Apart from these down points the phone is a snatch.

"
"

  One plus Nord is an average phone. With everything second best, screen is 90 Hz and is smooth but colours aren‚Äôt  so Punchy.Camera is also average, front camera softs and ruins pictures by AI, could be fixed by software let‚Äôs see.My variant has 12 Gb of ram but works like it has less.Conclusion- Its really nice phone for average user but i will not recommend it for someone who is looking forward it for photography, or some serious usage.

"
"

  In this price really good phone one plus launched. Buy One plus NORD if you are going to buy a new phone. I purchased this cause i wanna take online lectures for hours and tried its camera and other features, initially liked it.

"
"

  I am using onplus nord I bought on 29 sep 2020 first time while using Google assistant it was working  after some time it was showing error message after that it is showing in OnePlus nord Google assistant is not supported and I have attached the image of Google assistant app and while swiping in left side of home screen first time while using news reader was shown but now it is not showing

"
"

  A product which is excellent for the price it is at. Amother class creation from the 1 + stable ! Totally money's worth. Features are brilliant. However was left a bit disappointed when I discovered, it's only 1 sim phone and for head sets / earphones one has to order the earphones cable as the port has not been given. Overall the phone is really good.

"
"

  So disappointed with the Nord. After all the hype created by One plus, I feel like my basic Asus Zenphone from years ago is still better.I've had the phone for 3 days and already facing significant issues.The phone heats up significantly during minimal usage. And now even when idle.Lags while switching between apps (So much for 12GB RAM!)Screen freeze so I can't receive callsFront camera quality is averageCan't believe the Nord has such basic problems. Tried connecting with their team but no response. Need a replacement or refund as it's definitely not worth 30k.

"
"

  Awesome experience with this phoneOnly 2 things I don't like this phoneOne is front camera in low light is not good & 2nd one is pubg smooth extreme setting didn't get hdr alsoOther than that phone is good and amazing experience you will get and I didn't get any display greentint issueDisplay is awesome and onemore main thing the phone is looking dam beautiful in blue colour I loved it blue colour I think it is the best colour I have ever seen üòäüòçü•∞

"
"

  I like its light-weight and comfortable design; its very easy to use all of its button and screen with single hand. However, looking at the price, I didn't like its camera quality and battery. One plus 6 was better than this though it was just 2-3K higher than this phone. I would say looking at its overall quality, its definitely over-hiked phone. I think we can get phone with equivalent features at 15-18K of another brands. I am very disappointed with its poor camera quality, as I just picked this up - thinking camera would be good compared to others phone.

"
"

  Within 5 days I am facing problem with finger print scanner it's not not working completely, worst fingerprint and face unlock scanner not expected in OnePlus atleast...Even one plus 6 is better than one plus nord which I used previously....Result of camera is not upto the mark.Auto call recording is also not available in this phone

"
"

  Really loved the new one plus nord phone .. camera quality is simply amazing .sharing few pictures for reference purposes. Battery life is also too good..very light and simply amazing gadget.  As a content creator ,my focus is always towards a good camera quality nd clear videos. Thank you one plus nord ..

"
"

  Satisfied with this product....Many people will think that there are other better option for this price range in market according to specs....But this Oneplus Nord is a balanced package with the best ui(Oxygen OS) which will give you nice experience.....The Processor 765g is descent in its work...I never got any problem while playing heavy games till now and I know I will not get a problem in future.....If you are a moderate gamer(not heavy gamer) and wanted pretty everything in a phone with OnePlus Branding than go for it.....

"
"

  I strongly recommend don't buy this phone...After one long week usage I found many bugs and many features are not present in this phone for name sake only one pluse here am listing out some cons1. If u use both sims and if u activate internet for sim1 and if u get call to to sim2 internet is disabling not even getting or unable to send normal msgs this is the biggest big. Earlier I was using redmik20pro and there is no this kind of problem2. If u disable whatsapp media visibility and try to download the images from chat it's not downloading.3. No Audio jack4. Network drop outs5. If u enable both fingerprint and face unlock face unlock is not working6. Battery also some what ok.

"
"

  The unit that I received doesn't have the infamous display tint issue and the battery life is also excellent. Now the phone is running OOS 10.5.5 and I get an average of 7 to 8 hrs SOT with basic social media and youtube and not to mention I don't game in this phone and definitely no PUBG. Camera is not the best but sufficient for an average user like me and I believe it will be improved in the coming updates. Build quality is awesome and feels premium for a user upgrading from a below 20k phone. I use Vodadone and VoLTE isn't yet supported by vodafone for this model. It's an excellent choice if you want a premium experience under a budget.

  Review after 2 months of usage:Daily usage beast, my usage is restricted to calling, social media, small games and news app:Pro (that actually matters) :1. Loud and clear earpiece‚ù§Ô∏è2. Smooth OS with fast face and fingerprint unlock3. Day long battery with 7-8 hours of usage4. 10 mins charge and you're good to go5. Camera has improved alot after OS Updates6. Sleek Design and light weightCons:1. Could have been a bit smaller in size for more handy usage.2. Sound is loud but quality should have been better.Yet to find anymore (from day to day perspective)

  One of the biggest reasons to buy the OnePlus Nord is for the software experience. ... Other reasons to go for the OnePlus Nord include an affordable price tag, 5G support, and a great AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The build quality is excellent as well, as is the overall design of the handset.

  Imagine you‚Äôve just purchased a 27k smartphone, initial days of it, not much screen time, no games installed just google maps, GPS that you use on your way to work and during that the phone heats up so bad that it gives heating alarm everyday within 30 mins of usage! Initially I thought it might be my car‚Äôs temperature in the morning hours but even in evening around 8 with just 30-45 mins of gps usage, boom temperature alert! Major Flaw I don‚Äôt know how people are keeping with it with higher screen time or maybe just issue with using gps but I had to eventually return it to amazon which was a smooth return and thanks to amazon for that.

  Except camera quality everything is just good, there are quad camera setup but third camera from top to bottom it is never working neither in portrait mode or night mode or wide angle mode or normal camera, it just never used. I think it is kind of gimmick to show that four camera setup. Apart from this the Oxygen os is just awesome as always, battery is mediocre, it runs almost a day for me. I think black onyx is much better color then the blue marble, I purchased bluemarble and it looks nice and funcky but not decent. Onyx Black is much more decent.

"
"

  Everything is good... but battery and camera is very bad.. no clarity in camera pictures and using internet watching YouTube videos will finish your battery. Need two times charging per day... if you play games forget about battery life half day gets drains....Charging so fast I am happy for that... In half hour gets 100percent...Process is fast in video editing in phone...

"
"

  Finger Print reader and face unlock are working very fast.Battery life is good.But Camera Quality made me disappointed. I Never expect that One Plus can give such a cheap quality of camera. When pictures clicked it looks like the mobile picture of 10k or 15k range. Slowmo camera of this phone is not working whenever I tried it it started dimmering. It seems one plus doesn't give much attention on this model and take it for granted. In the beginning I faced many bugs. Suddenly Mobile started to heat and battery was drained quickly, Pixels of picture was torn.Processor and performance of phone is good. But again I'll say worst camera.Lookwise this is good and lightweight.

"
"

  It is worst quality phone from OnePlus.I purchased Nord for 30k and I had lot of problems with it and I sold it through OLX for 27K.*Display tint issue*Display is not good as other oneplus models*Network issue*Camera is terrible at most of the time.*I doubt that its RAM is 4gb. I had12gb variant but it gives just a 4gb feel.*I'm a big fan of Oneplus, that's why I bought it without looking for much reviews and I was cheated by Oneplus.So don't buy this phone,guyz.Adhil.MalappuramKerala

"
"

  Many review I read and I was in tension.. but after reached my mobile I am very happy.. It's look very premium both front and rear side... camera, sound, display battery backup etc all are best... Only front camera need to improve and I request to  OnePlus company to improve portrait video as a oppo Reno  4...please go for it don't look negative comments ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëç

  Amazing product go for it.... Camera great... Build quality way ahead campare to other phones.. softare too good... Additionally some more small features which are very useful...

"
"

  There is a problem with blutooth connectivity, network connectivity and automatically mobile is getting switch off automatically I kept replacement but Amazon response was too worst I never expected such type of response, still they are not giving replacement for the mobile. Please Don't buy electronic products in Amazon ( worst service and response).

"
"

  Pros:-Selfie Camera is awesome.RAM & External Memory are beast at this range.Sound Quality is bombardier.Look is too sexy.The back has a beautiful shine and lustrour.Cons:-No earphone jack, so no wired earphones.Back camera is a bit disappointing.Battery life isn't that powerful.All together it's a good into budget phone with a lot of features and a brand name.You can go for it, I promise it won't disappoint you.

  One plus never fails to surprise. I purchased this phone for my mother who has always been a samsung user. Initially she took a while to adjust but now she is in love. The battery life and camera quality are the cherry on top of a beautiful cake. Overall the phone delivers and lives upto the one plus standards. It is fairly priced and does not burn a whole in one's pocket.Overall, we are pretty happy with this purchase. Highly recommended.

  After using more than week my final review about my one plus nord...‚ô•Ô∏èThis is my honest review about this phoneCamera is decent that means more than avg 8/10Battery - 9/10OS- 10/10Performance -9/10Charging speed -10/10Speaker - very gudIf u want a overall Decent phone under 30 kNote- I'm not gamer that means if u considering for pubg and all heavy games it's not powerful as per other phones competitive phones who have 8 series SoC who did better performance as compared to this.Overall a great phone...if u love gud balanced smart phone with great Os üî•üî• and  more than decent performanceYou never regret after purchasing..

  There is a software (app or OS) glitch. The photo gallery just doesn‚Äôt open. I have to goto files and look at thumbnail views but cannot blow-up the pictures there either.SMS also has some issues.Even the backlight fluctuates in terms of brightness.Camera seems good, haven‚Äôt tried it for low light / nightscape yet. However, not sure how to access the third camera on the back (only have controls to 12 Mp and 48 MP camera)

"
"

  I have been loyal user of OnePlus from their very first product OnePlus One. Their devices are known for the sheer performances and crisp UI. And this hasn't disappointed either except macro camera.Forget about the negative reviews and take this phone for brilliant experience.

"
"

  I have been a one plus one user, and this phone stands nowhere close to it. Be it the design of the phone or the battery life. The processor is pretty good, the phone works very smoothly, and so is the face unlock display and finger sensor unlock. But battery sucks. The camera is not that good but is not that bad also.Overall I will rate this phone 4 stars. I hope that One plus may provide some updates to enhance both the battery life and the camera output. Till then 4 stars.

"
"

  Awesome, phone's really fast, charging is awesome its OnePlus after all, I need not say anything, u can just understand by how fast the stock got finished, durability of the phone is good(many said not soo good but I don't think so), made my life easy, camera got improved after update.

"
"

  Well people on YouTube said their battery lasted a day long for casual using. I don't think that's true. All I do most of the day is turn on hotspot. The battery goes from 100 to 50s or even 40s by then(9AM to 2PM). But the good thing is it charges back in less than an hour. So on a typical day it has to be charged 1.5 times rather 1 full charge. Also the 90Hz display is excellent. Camera quality is really good for it's range. Fingerprint sensor is excellent. The color(blue marble) is really vibrant and the phone just goes in my hand like it's not a 6.5 inch long one. I am new to the Oxygen OS, bur I can say it's really good. Overall, except for the battery life, it's a great phone.

"
"

  28th July order the phone. Phone got it 25th August but I'm reviewing as on 16th day after.After 15th day  one Plus nord phone is completely dead.Yesterday(15th day) night that one is 85% charge but today morning phone is not working completely dead.So that's ma experience.So please try to another product or brands opted.  that's better...

"
"

  To be frank the best budget phone that I could get on OnePlus..Seamless and very fast operations..Till a but having issue with the keypad..Camera quality is average..Not very great like other OnePlus and bettery life is good...Overall a budget friendly mobile from Oneplus

  Im proud holding and using this phone. Superb technology with stylish model.Im sure u love it.Dont go with negative reviews on camera or other quality parameters, pls buy it, u love it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  Defective piece was delivered. Mobile is getting switched off randomly and after 15-20 mins its getting on. Still waiting for replacement.Finally received very bad customer service from amazon, not at all satisfied. Amzon is not taking the responsibility for the product.

  The overall phone is great but the camera is not that good and if you are using 90hz then the battery will drain quickly thanks to wrap charge it charges 0 to 100 in 30 min.best part the screen is very good oxygen os is great and fingerprint works fast.avg gaming experience..

"
"

  I'm writing this review after 10 days of purchase. This nord works absolutely fine in all conditions. Some of YouTubers said negative for views. Nord display colors r better than any of the IPS display phones n u can play games in HD with NO lags, even though camera also is well optimised (after yesterday's update) . Be FUTURE READY and NEVER SETTLE ‚ù§Ô∏èOnePlus.

  1st of all absolutely fantastic experience... I don't face any kind of lag, no heating issue... as smooth as possible...camera is too good bt need some updates..need update on battery life..btw smooth oxygen os iss just awasom..btw night camera is the best in the segment... selfie camera is not just no ..its really good.. highly recommend this on...thnks fr the device OnePlus ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  I got my nord delivered yesterday and I have found colour fading at the bottom left corner of my screen mainly at the low brightness(very noticeable).

"
"

  Fingerprint reader was good.Battery life was not much good as I've expected.And another thing is the heating issue.The phone heats up while charging and the charger too heats up with the phone.Camera quality was good but the front camera video was not good.It is not having the mirror effect we can't change it on our choice.We can change it on oppo and realme phones but here in OnePlus there's no option available to change.It's default.And the last thing I would tell is that it's not having a SD Card support.It would be better if it would have SD Card Support.Overall I'll give 4 Star to this phone.It's a good phone but it's heating issues are a bit problematic for me.

"
"

  Superb PhoneOnePlus Nord is a good choice in the Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 segment. If you are an average user then it may be a good idea to go for the low-end variant with 6GB of RAM to get the best bang for the buck. If you ever wanted to buy the OnePlus 8 but the price deterred you, then the Nord is the right opportunity to get a OnePlus flagship experience for a lesser price. The Nord is a fine overall package but do not expect it to be a replacement for a true flagship device which runs the latest Snapdragon 800 series processor. Having said that good battery life and the promise of timely software upgrade makes the Nord a compelling choice under Rs 30,000.

"
"

  Facing Green and pink tint on my phone... I know it's not a thing of big concern for many.. But believe me when you notice it once you won't get rid of it. It's hell annoying. After spending 30k (which is huge amount for me) I was not expecting this from OnePlus device.My only suggestion is.. if you can spend 5-6k more...then go for 7t.My feeling for nord is like...""Maza nhi aaya""I finally yesterday asked Amazon to replace the products . Now waiting for Amazon Technician. Fingure crossed

"
"

  The product is good looking ! Weight is balanced overall everything is good except two major problems, tint issue is not a big deal in Ur daily usage!One major thing is camera:Don't expect much ,it's average, not very good, just good!The other is battery life:Thought would stand at least one day ,but it's hard unless we adjust to keep the charge for the whole day ...I mean not good for a full time user !Updates improved the camera section..but just a slight improvement!Battery is strong after half of of its charged is drainedAnd finger print is just good...!

"
"

  I bought this phone just 15 days ago but very disappointed.The sound quality is very poor , the voice on the call is very lowly heard. 1 GB RAM of apple is way better than 12GB RAM in this phone. The keypad does not pop up sometimes. The new phone battery survives for about 18 hrs on simple phone calls and normal work without any gaming or long videos. If you have couple of zoom calls it dries very fast

"
"

  Awesome produc from one plus some faced camera quality not nice but after 10.5 update they have been so good . Best mobile in this price segment .If you are a day to day user and a average user just go for it  not suitable for gamers and heavy usersProsAwsome buildUser-friendly osSmooth screenCameraConsSometimes heat a littleAverage night photosBack case quality is averageSignal of bluetooth is averageBut the above cons can be retififed by software updates hope one plus will do fixIf you like this review hit a like and have facing any problem do let me know

"
"

  Both the software and the hardware is of high quality. Camera is good and after the updates it's performance has increased and taking good photos and videos. Display is also very good and the processor is also performing without any lags. Battery lasts for 1 full day with heavy usage.

"
"

  It's been less than a month I bought this phone and there are already so many scratches on the phone. The screen is pathetic, it keeps attracting so much dust that I have to keep cleaning every one hour to have a clean screen. I am so disappointed with this phone, no value for money. Also another disadvantage cannot plug in head phones. As it was not enough to spend this amount for this useless phone now I have to spend a heavy amount for the ear buds. And everyone knows how horrible Amazon customer service is, they don't even consider customers as humans after 10 days of return window. For USA return window is 30 days, for India its 10 days. So much racism.

"
"

  - Great performance in case of multitasking and processing speed.- Overall feel handy and the weight distribution is great.- WRAP charging support works great.Cons:- Observed frequent Bluetooth interruptions while using 1+'s Bluetooth headsets- The DTMF/touchtones while calling is not working properly, whenever called to customer care found the issue that it's not detecting the keys which are pressed.Overall in case of speed and processing Nord is at its best, but if you are looking for a phone with a good camera then this may not be a great purchase for you.

"
"

  Phone is worth every penny. It is the best phone in this category. I feel OnePlus has really got boon for people with less budget and still want to enjoy flagship product. I had been using it for more than a month, phones performance in all segments of display, camera, speed, etc. Have been just perfect. I would personally rate 6 üåü and a Must buy for All.Thanks, hope you find my review helpful.

"
"

  I had been using a Redmi device for past three years and Nord feels like an amazing upgrade. The 90 Hz screen is a visual treat and the camera quality is good. My battery life is usually 8 to 9 hours as I am a heavy user but 30 W charger is quite fast. I can play games without a hitch and browse Instagram with a lot ease and grace. I really recommend this to all those who can afford it as it is a future proof device.

"
"

  Pros:1. Oxygen OS2. Battery life3. Warp ChargeCons:1. Display tint2. Camera below par except the main cameras on both front and backBuy this phone for regular usage and the performance will be as expected from a OnePlus device, smooth. The display does have tinting issues, which might or might not be resolved through OTA updates. The cameras barring the main sensors are below par. The fingerprint reader is quick and recognises almost everytime. The battery can easily last a day under normal usage.Considering Oxygen OS11 will deviate from stock Android UI , might have to think twice before buying.

"
"

  I have been using one plus 3 from past 4 years. By expecting same quality and features ordered the phone and very much disappointed with the quality and the performance. Camera is just like any other Chinese phones and it has so much whitening effects and low quality. Battery is draining so fast and after the os update it became little better. This phone is not worth the price and cannot be compared with the previous one plus mobiles

"
"

  Great phone,great camera in pro mode.......my screen on time with 90Hz display is 5hr whic is too low I think Oneplus may fix this soon in OXYGEN OS 11....... Eagerly waiting for OXYGEN OS 11 with fixing all the bugsI can recommend if all bugs are fixed in OXYGEN OS 11Bugs:1.while switching to wild angle there is an bug2.while scrolling notification this is an bug3.while gaming there is network problem4.while using Google "" not Chrome"" there is network issue showing as ""you are offline""5.some times 90hz is not used at application or website scrolling

"
"

  Kind of fat ,heavy and bulky... Looks very ordinary, I took the blue one...Heats up very soon...camera at low light is terrible...and only the main camera quality is decent ...the rest of the camera r just for gimmick..battery is decent...also the auto light is too dim to be visible to read.. not impressed at all with this one plus offering...main problem being the thickness and weight of the phone..

"
"

  Pros:Stock Android, minimal bloatware.On-screen fingerprint scannerCons:Performance- performs poorer than my 3 years old OnePlus 5.Lag in using apps - doesn't feel like more than a 12-15k phone.Camera - pic quality is that of a 12k device.A waste of money mid range phone.

"
"

  Definately your are very happy after you bought one plus nord like phone because it will provided all features in 30k which will not provided when we are compare to others phone. I am thankful to Amazon also because of rapidly delivery system.Camera is very good in focusing nd taking very clear photos. If you  are work in office then you didn't need to carry charger with you because of its battery life. Thank you team one plus nord and Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Game changer in the segment and pricing. The Plastic finish could have been improved. The Functionality, Camera and Refresh speed is what you seek at this price band. I would say go for this one if you frequently love to change phones every year and a half , top up and buy another and continue this trend rather being burdened with a 50K phone and get bore and still get stuck for resale. Live in present , evolve with changing times.

"
"

  A really great phone for the price.90Hz screen is awesome and so snappy. The cameras are good too. Except the macro one. But I knew what I was getting into so can't complain.Battery life is great too. Lasts me a day to a day n a half at times, the charging is superfast.Really appreciate OnePlus sending a cover in the box too.The only thing missing really is the headphone jack. But I'm using the c-type converter cable and it works just fine. Will recommend using the original converter by OnePlus though.

"
"

  My review is after 75 days usage of Nord (12+256)Start with cons :-1.battery backup very less..getting max 6hrs SOT2.back 2 Cameras are total waste and slow motion video recorder some times flickers and very dull.3.even in normal browsing phone heats up.. imagine while gaming what will be the phone temperature..its above 42 degrees4. Dual volte never worksPros:-1 Fluid amoeled display awesome2 warp change full battery in 60mins approx3 look and finish is good4.i dint face any display tint issue

"
"

  overall good phone with average camera.Main drawback - Ringer, Vibration or silent option is available only through a physical button/lever rather than a soft button. I am not a fan of physical button to manage ringer/vibration or put phone on silent mode. in case i have to toggle between these modes 4-5 times a day, i doubt if the lever will last more than a year.

"
"

  All over its a good package but it's not the best out there in the market1) if you are a gamer especially if you play pubg then please don't buy it now as oneplus has confirmed that they will roll out an ota update for the frame rate setting first let it come and check the review and but itCarema is decentBattery is a major issue it's drains like anything even when you're not using the phone so please keep in mind.**However the overall the experience is damn good phone is pretty smooth RAM management is pretty osum.***All to all of you are lite user then close your eyes and go for it :)

"
"

  A very excellent product,when I first saw the reviews,I got some negative reviews.I thought that I should order m51 as I am already using samsung note 10plus,but when I further read from the reputated sites about the products they said that this is the perfect product of this range.I also saw some negative reviews about the camera but when I used it was like oh my god!!!!awesome camera.I have not charged my phone from past 30hrs and still it 48%.I didn't saw anything negative while I was using my phone.I was also provided with Gorilla glass , a red membership card and a welcome letter from OnePlus.Snapdragon 765G is awesomeTHANK YOU

"
"

  Does not detect my fingerprint. Have to try at least 5 times. The camera quality is okay. Not excellent. I've been using it for a week now and my new Nord hangs at times. The screen goes bonkers. For a new phone the battery life also isn't upto the mark. It drains pretty quickly and I have to charge at least twice a day.I was really looking forward to this phone. Waited 2 months to get mine. But somehow the phone does not live up to the hype.

"

  I personally feel that company's decision to lower the price(which is actually not so lower) with reduced quality rather substandard quality is not a worthy decision. ‡§î‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§§‡•ã oneplus 10000 ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•á‡§ó‡•ç‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü ‡§Æ‡•á ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§®‡§æ ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§§‡§¨ ‡§®‡§æ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§π‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§π‡•ã‡§ó‡§æ?

  Nord comes with1. Clean OS , 90 hz refresh  with amoled display2. Nice haptics3. Decent Camera and Battery4. Features like alert slider and in display finger print scanner.5. SD 765G chipset is fast enough for gaming.Quality of videos from this device is outstanding and also the good sound capturing.Areas to improve is:Images quality is not upto mark . 2 MP macro cam is useless. Even if there is a depth sensor , edge detection are not upto mark whrn shoot in potrait mode.No headphone jack , slight pinkish tint developed in display sometimes. And there is no always on display .

  After 2 months I m wrinting this review.I m facing network issue in this phone.when I called anyone or when I get any call I can't lift  call.Call cuts automatically and  show error ""mobile network fail""I never face this situation in any mobile.in emergency calls get angry on phone soon it will brake in my hand.With experience I m wrinting this review  I need someone help to fix thisOne plus team please help me on this issue to solve.because I bought this phone in EMI.still EMi's not finished but facing a problem and not able to use this phone.Amazon team pls forward this issue to one plus team

"
"

  My first impressionFor a start its a very handy phone, feels good in the hands not heavy and the functionality is worth the hype.I was looking for something low key and I found this device to be very apt for the purpose. Camera is good, processing is good,  sound is good.It's a overall good phone.Will be absolutely certain post a week's time.

"
"

  Not worth the money.  Especially if you are looking for a good camera. This is the worst choice.I am not a techie but as a user this phone was a big disappointment . The camera is the biggest problem.  The photos have no sharpness.No matter how firmly you hold the device (conciously) majority of the pictures are blurredIt takes few seconds atleast for the focus to be ready for the click.The portrait mode is the most terrifying experience. The background blurring result is extremely poor , Even Mi & vivo does the brilliant job .Pls don't buy if you are looking for a good camera .

"
"

  Decent phone for this price. Should have taken the 7T instead for 8k more.

"
"

  No doubt display is very nice, but minimum brightness has been locked may due to tinting issue. It creates issues due in the night specially when u watch movies etc. speaker is good not best. Camera is worst. I think poco f1 was shooting better pics than NORD. Focus issue is also there. Front camera is nice but edge detection and boundaries need to be corrected.Battery is also draining too fastly that tooo by minimal use. Not worth this price. Its 8/128 should have been at 24000 only.

"
"

  Overall it's ok, 4/5.Some display green and pink tint issue is there still after update which can be noticed. I contacted Oneplus customer care number and they are saying it's not at all a issue, it will be cleared in further updates. Hope it will be cleared soon. Camera is decent good outputs. Battery is the key screen on time in 90Hz approx. 7hrs on a medium usage. Normal user can get it 1.1/2 day easily.For the price range and brand value it's value for money looks premium.

"
"

  Awesome product! I like it. But the battery backup is just ok not excellent. What I don't like is that the selfie cam could be better..not upto the expectations. And also the inbuilt AppLock is poor...offers less security.. we are not able to put lock for settings

"
"

  What i wanted, sAmoled display, a 5g facility as we going to use this phone at least for 2years, and the last one but not the least is CAMERA, very dissapointing that at first 1+ giving ad that nord is flagship camera phone, honestly a 10k budget phone give better pic than nord. Oneplus need to correct this. And i believe that oneplus will find some way to rectify this. As a software developer 1+ provide better experience for their customers.

  My charger is not working well maximum full charging time is 1houts and 45 minutes so I am not happy with this phone

"
"

  I am writting this review after 1 month of usage.Very good performance till now.So smooth, fast. Even battery stays for long. I get easily 1 day of usage after battery fully charged.Warp charging is really good and it charges fast for you. I was sceptical about the camera image quality. Let me tell you it produces real good images for the price range. I don't see a problem in that. Night mode photography is a bit down I will say. Videos are superb. Very good build quality as well. Overall I am happy with this product. Please go ahead and buy would be my suggession

  Pros:1.90Hz Display2.Camera3.Battery with 30T wrap charging4.Oxyzon OS5.5G processorCons:1.No 3.5mm Jack2. Missing Dolby AtmosOne thing I wanna say that software was really really good I never expected this ,the best software I ever seen till now. Only thing I can say ONEPLUS ROCKS ALWAYS

  Earbuds/phone enroll during launch for purchasing Nord in aug20 they will receive coupon for purchasing earbuds/phone, but i haven't received the same,One thing the sim tray ejection and microphone hole both looking same it is big problem, we initially checked in micro phone for sim tray ejection,Hand feel is very nice, camera battery not checked fully

"

  Pros1.Display is fab but you will notice a yellowish white compared to lcd panel.not pure white but good2.90 hz is smooth dude3.processor is fab .it handles everything which you throw on it4.battery life is superb sot is 6hrs for me5.other feautres are greatCons1.Camera Camera Camera !!!!2.Battery is draining fast when not in use i dont know why3.bluetooth,wifi,Networksignal disconnect ramdmly ...need to fix in ota update4.Tint issue is there in green colour but not annoying5.Charge speed is not as promised

"
"

  Phone is pretty good at this price. You can definitely go for it.Front camera works very well as compare to rear camera. Rear camera needs to be improved by the updates. Performance is very fine as expected and 90hz display enhance your experience. Battery backup is fine as it goes for one day with single charge with heavy usage and it charges the phone in almost 1.20 hours.Experience on oxygen OS is damn good. And in hand feel of the phone is great as It's not that big and bulky.But there is a display tint issue and it is visible only in the dark but it will not affect you in any way. So just go for it.

"
"

  I think it was worth the 30k. Totally loved it. After reading some reviews even i got skeptical but i found no such issues of screen tint or battery drain. Camera is not bad, its still nice. If you are swithing from mid range devices you will totally fall in love with this phone else all iphone and oneplus 8 users would find it less premium whoch is obivious

  I used this device last around 20 days. I used this phone in the night continuously 4-5 days. After using this itching started in my eyes. I immediately stoped to use this. My eyes are ok now. But I am using Samsung since long, Never feel such bad thing in my eyes. Presently using Nord and Samsung both. Weight and Speed of the phone is good.

"

  Awesome phone. Phone delivery was much more earlier than expected date. Phone packaging was good. Includes Red club membership and welcome letter by one plus. Camera quality and audio is very good. Value for money. Recommended in this price range and best launch by One Plus. The only thing which could be better is battery. It gets low soon if you use your phone continuosly..

  I bought this for my mother and she uses starmaker and similar karaoke apps. infact that apps are her lifeline, this phone does not have 3.5 mm, so I bought Type-C to 3.5mm conveter ORIGINAL oneplus.. but alas there is audio delay issues in recording and hear-back voice on all of such apps. Want to buy directly type-C headphoses but currently none available in online and offline market, visited chroma etc. but not avaialbe not even on oneplus website. what is the point if they are not keeping compatible accessory with the phone. cheaters.

"
"

  This phone is terrific! For those who can't afford expensive oneplus 7 or 8, this phone comes for rescue. Overall, it's a best deal at this price for a brand like oneplus. I have used it just for 3 days now and really happy with it. Will update my review after few months of use.

"
"

  We have lot of video's and reviews about the phone being good/bad, I went a head and bought the mobile because I loved it. To be very honest the phone is good, the build quality, battery life, vivid colours, everything is good. If you ask me just buy stuff that you like and go for it ‚ò∫Ô∏è

  Very worst & bad experience with mobile and poor customer serviceAfter the third day, mobile is not working. It

  Writing this review after two weeks usage.Excellent phone with outstanding performance in an affordable rate. All was in accordance with my expectations. Camera quality was ok, but after an update it was awesome. I observed a slight tint issue with the screen in dark mode and dark screen, but it not a issue while using we can only notice that issue rarely.

"
"

  So here with the Nord in hand! Powerful machine I have ever used! The fluidity in the usage is God! Love the interface and the free bloatware Android usage. Oxygen os does improve the performance of the chipset!I don't know why everyone complain about the camera which is not that bad. Actually speaking, the best camera I would say and the pictures speak!Cons:1. Fingerprint reader is not that accurate. Sometimes it's really annoying in unlocking the phone. Please fix this with the upcoming updates.I find this as an only con for me!

  I have been using iphone for many years , recently oneplus has impressed me with its products. This is one such oneplus mobile you will fall in love with , an absolutely stunning mobile. Mobile looks premium in your hand , glass back finish is excellent.  Camera quality is Great and powefull battery last for a day usage for me and which take 1hr to full charge. Gaming is a must have experience in this mobile. Overall great product.Thank you oneplus.

  Received today.Having screen tinting issue.

  A little bit heating problem , but if u leave it for a 20 to 30 minutes the heat usually goes. After using 1 month I face battery problem, I have to charge more than 1 hour for full charge after that I registered a complaint in the one plus community,, they told me to give my mobile charging logs, after giving the logs my charging problem is fixed.And now whenever my battery is low or below 30 percent,, i usually charge the mobile in the Zen Mode for 30 minutes, and it shows sometimes full charge or around 90 percent of charge.overall i dont have any camera issue, hang issue , or fingerprint issue..

"
"

  CONS:Camera low light issueScreen brightness is not goodBattery backup worstPRONSSound is AwesomeBattery full charged 0 to 100% in an hour approx.Display Quality is Good

"
"

  Packaging very good. Delivery very fast. After using 5 days, following pros and cons have been experienced by me.Pros-. Display, Unique Plastic cover in the box, Red cable card, Doesn't seems plastic body on back, Camera at par with the competition brands,Cons-. Battery drainage very fast and charging time as claimed by the company, 5G option will be updated in future system update. Limited camera filter options, front camera not as expected.

"
"

  It's amazing & disheartening that One Plus Nord is unworthy of its price. Pictures taken with the phone shows green tint. The icons are more or less yellow in color. Red colored Icons are deep brown. When keyboards are used the Emojies are yellow in color. Find no ways to correct these problems. You should have the option of return. It""s really wastage of money for a retired person of 74 years old.

"
"

  I have recently shifted from ios to Android thinking too much about operational efficiency in android phones. 1 plus nord has satisfied me on all terms I could think off, best user experience with no lags, WARP charging works well, and fingerprint reader is one of the best I have used. Overall the phone works seamless and would say one of the best recommended android phone in market.

"
"

  Much awaited smart phone from One Plus. The high end version just compensates all the requirement of a smartphone guy.The performance & screen size is commendable.Only one to improve is the camera quality which was expected to match it's flagship models.

"
"

  Buy 7t instead. Better camera, better processor, better build quality.Dual front punchhole on Nord does not look good. Cameras ( both front and back) are average. Oxygen OS is good. Connectivity, call quality, mono speaker also good.Overall value for money.

"
"

  Nice product but overpriced OnePlus nord

"
"

  Phone has good battery life, good camera, really fast charging, smooth 90Hz amoled display. This would have been a 5 star review from me, but the device I own has the purple tint issue at sub 20 brightness on gray backgrounds. It doesn't affect my everyday usage much but it does get irritating to see some times.

"
"

  Lives upto expectations. Good quality. Fairly average on everything else. I'm stuck to OnePlus because i love the OS. The best stock Android mod

"
"

  Well ,all i need is a bloat free os and great camera and OnePlus got my back .Of course there's green purple tint issue under 20 brightness only on grey background. Recent Amoled screen panels have the same problem even on brands like rog, samsung, Huawei. hope oneplus fixes it on upcoming updates.

"
"

  OnePlus gave Bluetooth connectivity issue in gift to customers buying Nord phone, Even after update bluetooth problem is not solved ,it's very annoying that phone doesn't have 3.5 mm jack and when u use bluetooth headset ,ur headset will disconnect in between of use and will not connect and even my bluetooth headset is One plus Wireless Z Bluetooth bullets.ALSO, battery drains very fast and charging is not as fast as it is claimed , Camera Quality is very bad ,One plus is loosing it's good customer because of Issues in their phones now.figer print reader is ok and camera is ok ok.

"
"

  My phone is not working may be there is a defective piece send by Amazon many problems are there like restart many times nd pdf file not open phone says not supported files nd there is no return option there is only replace option so plz think before buy this product

"
"

  Pretty much nice phone honestly.I mean i was in doubt whether to buy it after reading the negative reviews but i finally did and i donot regret about this.Some people were saying about the camera is very bad but its pretty good actually.The fingerprint reader is smooth and Oxygen OS is swift like butter and battery life is good.The phone gets charged very very fast due to 30w warl charger.It works smoothly and doesnot hang for a bit even after running too much applications.No heating issue till nowOverall a good phone.

"
"

  Really awesome product, it charges 60% within 20mins,Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)‚Ä¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.‚Ä¢No serious heating issues at all.‚Ä¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.‚Ä¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)Display quality also superb. Touch sensors verg accurate and speed. Nice product from OnePlus, thank you one plus.

"
"

  My first one plus phone. I dislike Chinese phones for the bloat ware that comes with phone. But oxygen OS is just like stock Android. Mobile feels good in hand. Back cover is sturdy enough to continue with it without buying a spare immediately. Screen guard provided with phone is very thin. One plus says it is to keep the on-screen fingerprint better sensitive.I am not a big fan of camera. I use it for general purpose. Camera is decent for normal use.No tint issue as told by many sites. Atleast to me.Happy with purchase.

"
"

  ¬†I was so happy when I received it. Idk why there are so many negative reviews because of them I was so double minded but the product is perfect. If you're thinking to buy just go for it. It's way faster than the mobiles in this range and it can easily beat some mobiles a little higher than the nord. Everything's great and I'm happy with it. I was also unsure of the color but when I got it, I knew it was the perfect choice. I used for a whole day and the battery backup is also good it can easily last from morning to night. Oneplus really did a good job

"
"

  I really liked this product a lot. but there are some cons like the front camera is not that good and also the macro doesn't click good pictures.I have to say this Amazon Customer Service is not that good. I constantly tried to get my product delivered on time but they refused to provide any reason until i posted order details on Twitter.

"
"

  Everything is awesome. Mainly its handy feel is great and luking Fantastic. Its processor is too gud.Fast process in every app open and run smoothly. Premium feel design to show its Class. Fingerprint reader is fast than others phn. Battery life according to 4000 mah is gud and its Camera quality in 4k resolution in 60 fps in front and 4k 30 fps in rear with Nice stabilization is Super. In this price segment best phn of 2020. If u want a premium device in this budget thn surely buy. All advance features bulit in it.

"
"

  Bad product from oneplus...never expected to get such bad quality in this range. The battery quality was not at all good. The heating issue is there in the device. Smoothness was not in the phone while using. What they advertise and what the customer receive is par different.

"
"

  This phone is gking thrlugh a lot of controversy but consider some things1)this is a newly launched and it will get many updates over time2)You get the feeling of the heavenly oxygen os in just 28k3)sure battery is a lil unoptimized but it will get optimized over time with updates3)Most important camera eill be updated as the people sitting at one plus are super comfy in their os and will fix it asap4)It's just 28k

"
"

  I have already ordered a replacement after speaking with the Amazon customer executive for almost 2 Hours.OnePlus QA is poor. Display doesn't provide pure white. The replacement phone too has Black Crush issue.Recently Bluetooth pairing issue too is observed.Better check before buy or buy it in a outlet Experience store.Mayans S1E4 on Disney+Hotstar to check Black crush issue.

"
"

  MY HONEST REVIEW:everybody knows about the advantages,let me say the disadvantages1. it carries fingerprint smudges very well.(from the 1st day itself)2.heating issues.(i use it continuosly for online classes-like 4-5 hours).(continuous 2hr usage we can feel the heat..but ..thats not an major issue)that's it.other than this i felt no problems(like for 1 month i have used,while writing this answer).and i am a normal user (no gaming) and i have to say onething...it has an amazing SUPER CHARGER....man that's really incredible fast.FINALLY : worth for the price.

"
"

  The battery discharged so quickly, even though if u charge the mobile for 100 percentage it wil drained within the 2-3 hours(use instagram and the whatsapp only)So the same coast I go for real me which is far better than OnePlus nord don't go for itWaste of money battery quality not up the mark

"
"

  I've been using this phone for over 3 days and I find it extremely slow . I thought speed was one of the selling points for nord. After using it for gaming I can see a very visible lag while scrolling or moving from one screen to the other . The video quality isn't great either YouTube videos look blurry no good detailing whatsoever.The camera is not great at all .macro mode is a gimmick. I don't know if I have a defected phone or is it the same problem with other phones as well. Highly disappointed for a much awaited phone

"
"

  Battery life should be improved.Other wise it's a great value for money & a perfect device for day to day uses.

"
"

  It's just too good..Loved itFeels premium.Edit.(Aft. 1 month) -There is a defect in main speaker on Full sound you'll here a disturbing sounds (chrrrrrr) which is not expected and usually comes from a low quality speaker on high volume. Now i don't know what to do. It's not a big issue bt one will never expect like this after paying 30k.

"
"

  I am first time using OnePlus product OnePlus Nord, honestly it is not much impressive everything it has is stock Google  things, you will not enjoy the oxygen OS, I would say samsung and Mi is more better in experience OnePlus everything thing is very simple on OnePlus..it has only the brand name that's it, you will get bored using it, think before buy or experience it somewhere else in store go for Samsung or Mi , OnePlus is less in features very simple & boring.they don't have anything of there own everything is taken from Google. OnePlus is good for its design and built that's it.

"
"

  Google play AR services not compatible and IR not supported this device idon't know if it is possible to OnePlus updates, cemara quality 48 mp not available zoom option available only 12 mp, photos clarity some place blurring night time blurring photo,when we have transferred vivo to OnePlus Nord upto 5 gp data bulk of files using inshare application heating issue occurred in one plus Nord but not heating vivo 1601.otherwise okAnd one more thing for AR issue resolved by another app full fill Arloopa that very useful for childrens. Heating issue occurred when charging and bulk file transfer.

"
"

  Pros -1. Excellent AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate. (Ignore the tinting issue hype as it does not cause any problems in day-to-day usage)2. Smooth Oxygen OS experience - No ads and extremely fast!3. Fast charging and decent battery life4. Good build quality (Though it is plastic frame, it is quite sturdy)Cons -1. Processor could have been a better one (Though 765G not at all a bad one)2. Pricing could have been a bit less.Overall, its a nice phone!

"
"

  Battery drains a bit fast if u have watches paired with it or if u r using it as a HOTSPOT,camera quality is good,processor is smooth, fingerprint sensor is fast & accurate ...overall Not the best but good phone

"
"

  While unboxing camera quality and battery life was not upto the mark, but after upgrades the camera quality and battery life is awesome. The phone is fully charged in around one hour, also for charging 10-15mins you can use your phone whole day with optimum use.Only thing you miss in this product is 3.5mm Jack, if anyone face issue in Jio Network i.e. because of call over wifi setting enabled, you just need to switch the setting to call over mobile network in Calling preference menu.Thanks OnePlus for the awesome product.

"
"

  The overall camera quality is pleasing but definitely not the best. This is because as long as you use the primary camera-- 48MP Sony IMX586-- the output is good. But the same cannot be said for the secondary sensors.The colours are crisp without any unwanted over saturation and the images come with a good amount of detail. But the experience of the camera depends a lot on the overall lighting and the lens you are using.

"
"

  Battery life and charging is really good that too for a 90hz screen. Display is the best and I don't have a green tint issue. The phone is really smooth and OS is very clean. Camera is not as flagship level and it was honestly terrible at the beginning. But it has improved since the special update Nord received. I installed Gcam and it is amazing much better than stock. Overall it's a fantastic phone at this price and little bit of future proof as 5G is coming.

"
"

  Guys battery quality is worst, it drains so fast and mobile heats very fast.Camera is average its not very good as oneplus gives in other mobiles.Built quality is also not very good as oneplus 7t.It is better to invest 7000 more and buy oneplus 7t that also I have and its the best phone in the range

"
"

  Great phone with Camera, Sound, Battery life giving optimal performance but sometimes it has network issues like phone gets disconnected automatically showing airplane mode and it shows data offline when the data is on.I tried to contact OnePlus community but they are giving the silly solutions and I visited there service centre and they are telling to give the phone for more than 15days that's really horrible from OnePlus and When I googled for network issue there so many people with the same network issues, really feels helplessHope they provide some update on this.

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is simply awesome from battery to camera it's like flagship killer. Build quality is awesome like you can feel holding premium phone. Fingerprint sensor is blazing fast. 4115 Battery lasts a day and with 30W warp charger, you can charge it in 55 min from 0 to 100%. Along with Snapdragon 765G 5G processor, OxygenOS and 90Hz Amoled screen, phone feels very snappy. And with 5G it's future proof. The 48MP sony IMX586 Main camera sensor is amazingly taking good pictures. You can see the shot added in my review. No complaints and it is all rounder phone. Simply go for it.

"
"

  Useless product by this Co. who always gave a better product. Features are lower even than two year old model ""One plus 6"", pathetic offer by the Co.Due to some reason, could start using the phone only two days before, return window is closed, but, heavily regret my decision to have opted for this model.All future purchases shifting to Samsung / Apple. Never to suggest anyone for ""One plus"".Why do you have to offer a low grade model when you raise the bar already. Extremely disappointed by this purchase.

"
"

  Phone is awesome at this range.Mobile charging time, battery backup, finger print reader like feature is very satisfying. Phone works with very good speed while using any app or browsing data.One thing painful is it's Picture quality taken from camera. It's start getting blurred even with small zoom. So, you should not buy this mobile if you are crazy to click photos on every occasion through mobile.Otherwise it's a good buy at this range.

"
"

  For me the phone is pretty good.Actually most of us are not the pro players and not the photo creators for a national or international wide competitions.So the phone is more than enough for all the normal users like me and sufficient features and it gives the best of all. The processing speed is too fast and having 12 GB and 256 GB is abundant for whoever are planning to buy a new phone just because ur old phone is not working much.And Yeah the charging is too fast.For This prize I found it as price worthy and no need to change the phone for the next 3 years and even more!!

"
"

  Perfect buttery smooth oxygen OS,camera quality is good ,runs as fast as other flagship OnePlus devices but not in gaming .Gaming works pretty well and don't expect flagship level gaming at this price point in OnePlus brand.No phone meets every expectation of user .This phone is good for regular user.The battery lasts for 1day while heavy use and one and half day for normal user. The warp charge is excellent. I didn't observed any tint issue in display I think this display issue is not seen in recent bought devices .My display is sharp .

"
"

  Finger print reader is really fast, camera quality of both rear and front are awesome in daylight, butfront cam is a disappointment at night,it sucksü§¢Nightscape is great. Macro is pathetic and useless.With G cam you can shoot much better videos and images.And by the way grey Onyx is just beautiful.

"
"

  Awesome phone. Battery life and camera quality are very good. Initially I was confused whether to buy realmex2 pro (sd855+) because of its processor. But I went for Nord and now I am sure that I made the right choice. Nord, being a new phone will get android updates for a couple of years and the sd765g is a very powerful processor. I had no issues with gaming and the gaming experience was wonderful. Plus, the oxygen os is just bliss. Undoubtedly, Nord is the best phone in this price range in my opinion.

"
"

  Absolute beast with some minor UI bugs.Although display have some green tint issue with 90hz mode not with 60hz.Also day to day usage is very fluid .You don't get this type of user experience with any other device in this price range.Camera is decent not like flagship as they hyped it.Battery backup is also decent with almost 7hrs SOT.Overall if you are a gamer don't go for this go for OnePlus 8 or something like 800series processor devices.As i am not a gamer..i am utmost satisfied with this product.Using from 8 days .

"
"

  After using it for over 20 days, I would like to point out one big dislike - the screen near fingerprint reader has noticeable tints. You can notice it while watching videos, playing games. Secondly, camera quality in low light is not so good, but in good lighting, you can see the images are pretty good. You can see the red color varieties and its distinction. Battery life, video and gaming experience is worth it for a phone at this cost price. If you want a durable mobile, go for it without a doubt.

"
"

  Great phone in the price segment , u will get more than wat u paid for .I have attached few images clicked in12mpMacro48mpFor me image quality is above average and satisfied with colours and contrast.Screen is amazingly smoothBattery is good , for a moderate users u will be left with 15-20% by the end of the day, that means u are good to go .Speakers are satisfactory , they are loud and better.No colour tint I experienced in my phone.Charges as expected . Warp charging is a bliss.

"
"

  While it has high RAM and storage, but the internal processor is not powerful enough to support the same. Camera quality is also very basic. Better to spend few additional thousands and opt. for galxy series with much better performance in all department..

"
"

  Dont know why they have launched such bad phone when they are not able to resolve any query of customers totally unsatisfied with this phoneWorst product ever i have ever purchased from amazon..... facing problem since i have purchased the phone and no customer service is responsing to my issue..... Guys you should not waste your money on this worst phone totally useless and second I have never seen such bad after sale service of any company.....you should think twice before buying this phone.....thats all my review for OnePlus

"
"

  OnePlus - Actually a Genuine Phone‚Ä¢ Processor working Fast‚Ä¢ 90Hz works smooth‚Ä¢ speakers are high quality‚Ä¢ Same Oneplus features as of other FoneWhat I don't see Upto mark-- Camera quality. As I personally have OnePlus 7 which is 48Mp but still Click really High contrasted clear pics as compared to Nord which is 64mp  and contrast is as dull as Xiaomi models.

"
"

  When I switched from 10k to 28k .I was bit nervous weither it will be appropriate to invest on such device but according to me 28k is bit high price 25k is perfect for this varient .Pros.1.good battery backup2.look like a premium phone3.display is excellent4.speaker is loud5.day light photo is perfect6.oxygen os is goodCons.1.low light camera struggle.2.dont have seperate password for app lock.3.According to me little bit expensive.

"
"

  On Phone screen from 15 day i purchase i started noticing and thin line, which is seen on white back ground and after 1 month I started searching for service center 2 listed in website but only one is working  and when i showed them they told they want to replace the screen and i asked for replace but they denied. it was a defective peace only. but this service people not agreeingPhone is not worthy of what is paid, not at all happy with phone performance and service center

"
"

  I'm writing this review after using this one plus nord (12gb,256 varient) for a week. I'm new user to one plus series ,So was much excited to buy this mobile. Now I'm so much disappointed battery life of the mobile is so worst, I need to charge my mobile every 6 hours even with low usage, camera quality is not even like redmi. SIM is not working properly, everytime it's coming as switched off. Other than classy look everything else is disappointed

"
"

  The camera is no where close to OnePlus 6T which is two year old phone. On spec comparison everything seems better. But practically the phone is really bad. I purchase Nord 5G 256GB +12GB RAM model and sold to cashify for 22k. 8k loss for usage of a day. A Big No to this Phone. Dont buy.

"
"

  Pros:1.Inscreen fingerprint works perfectly2. Colors are good and display is great3. Oxygen OS is very easy to use & got almost everything you need4.front camera is good in normal light conditions and ultra wide view is useful5.looks good at this price6. Warp charging works wellCons:1. Photos taken in low light are not impressive2. OnePlus says phone will brighten screen in dark for face unlock but sometimes doesn't work properly like works 6-7/10 times3. Audio from phones speakers is average.

"
"

  Straight to the point:- Camera is awful. Pixels distort and too much of beautification/filters applied. Consider macro lens does not exist because it is useless.- Battery is life just average like any other mid range phones.- Overall build quality and performance is smooth for 30 bucks price range.

"
"

  The battery is draining faster even with low or moderate usage.Battery backup is very poor. Even I have not installed any games yet. Only instagram, Facebook and songs like normal daily work. Then also it is draining too fast. Only 4_5 hours of screen on time with normal routine work. Highly disappointed.

"
"

  I have been using this phone for about a month...This is really a good phone in mid range for avg use . The software is at its peak with oxygen OS performing great .  Coming to its battery performance = it is quite good , one can use it for whole day ..... I won‚Äôt personally recommend this phone for the people who are obsessed with mobile photography becoz the camera quality is not that great ...it‚Äôs just okay for regular use ... 90hz refresh rate is really good ,you can feel the difference.... would say that this phone is really good at this price range .

"
"

  As we know oneplus try to do better always but in this product oneplus left some mistakes like front camera not impressive .Front camera is so bad quality pictures .Speakers are not impressive .And very things is good as like prize .Plastic body we can adjust but camera not adjustable

"
"

  Hi viewers,On the time pre-book , I booked phone and I was curosity for Nord phone . After used one week I found some issue which aa the followingProns : if you talk about phone then I saw good and size and weight (light weight) are standard and pretty UI of android 10 .Cons : Battery life less , but it's depend upon the usage . But I observed ,if oneplus will do more work on battery life .As per my usage 100 to 15 % came in 5 hour .Over all phone is good and minimum budget onePlus gave best for users.

"
"

  Super bright screen , excellent camera performance both in day and night. Responsive fingerprint scanner.sturdy build quality. Battery shulould have been large atleast 5000mah. Otherwise super phone much better than other chinese phones.

"
"

  Writing this review after using it for 1 week. It's a awesome phone with lots of new things. Best camera both the rear and front one. Battery life is not that great. It manages to last for only one day with moderate use but not to forget about the fast charging. Overall I would say a nice phone, stylish with good camera and you can customise the display, color and many other things as just you want your phone to be.Thank you One Plus for bringing this midrange phone to the market.

"
"

  Highly disappoint with Amazon being a prime member. Deffective product with broken screen delivered after waiting for over 21days. Even after technical engineer confirmation of product defectiness amaozn not able to replace with new phone and ask to wait for another 10days time. This is highly disappointing, request you to arrange replacment without further delay. Since i have not use the phone yet can't comment on quality.

"
"

  I brought new one plus nord on 2nd if September.It getting hanged sometime.There is always bluetooth connectivity problem it get disconnected automatically.Screen is going blank sometimes when I switched between application.Sound keeps playing for 5-6 second if I switch from youtube to another application.And there is network problem I have to restart the phone 3-4 times a day as it showed my phone out of coverage area or switched off .

"
"

  Actually I am not a heavy user so this phone works fine for me but One Plus claimed that the battery charges from 0-70% in 30 mins which is actually false. In 30 mins it charges from 0-55%. The camera is average, takes 1-2 seconds to process after clicking the photo; if you immediately move it away after clicking the photo, then the photo gets blurred. Battery life is normal, it lasts for more than a day on normal usage.Buy it if you want a OnePlus experience.

"
"

  Oneplus as a brand i purchased the Oneplus Nord. But i would suggest Honor i.e huwai phone and software is excellent. Oneplus Nord missing basic functionality like whenever i call there is an mute button on phone which gets pressed in every call multiple times. I think oneplus team has missed to give focus on the basic calling functionality. There is no option to remove mute button. Further phone doesn't have basic copy feature like u can't copy selected text from sms you want. Entire message gets copied.Only Look wise and other features are good.

"
"

  Pros-Ease operationGood cameraSlim designValue for moneyGet less warmCons-Battery life is just ok, you need to charge it 2 times approx in a day without using battery saver.That's why stopping for battery at 3 stars, otherwise would given 5.

"
"

  All round it is a best phone for normal people.It is an amazing product."" But there is a display issues(tyndall issue)"",no camera issue, but the battery draining is little more ! But we can believe that the oneplus software updates will be fix it soon. The fingerprint sensor is so fast and smooth. Lightweight is an important factor. It is much better when it comes with aluminium frame and Snapdragon 845 G processor.I feel better with this phone because I waited for a long time to get a better product. #Comparatively 1+  Nord is a best choice compare with realme X3# *(just my opinion)*

"
"

  Good overall performance phone.PROS:1.Display was awesome2.Good Daylight camera performance.3.Good battery backup with 30W dart charger4.90HZ display was smooth5.Gaming was smooth while playing in 90HZ mode.6.Got 3 updates within a week.(FutureProof phone)7.OXYGEN OS for smooth experience.CONS:1.Camera was average during lowlight2.No Headphone jack3.No Sterero speakersOverall - Good all rounder phone under 27K.Buy this phone without any second thought.

"
"

  An all rounder however the only observable kink till this point is the battery performance. It's adequate for most of the daily use scenarios, except heavy gaming.Also, if you're looking to use the mobile cameras extensively, then install GCam rather than using the in-built camera app, because the difference is noticeable.

"
"

  1. Fingerprint is very fast and accurate.2. Battery life is above average.3. Camera quality varies with the updates as OnePlus sends more updates.4. Display : Yes their is a tint issue but it's not noticeable until u try to notice it.5. Sound quality is good.You can go for this without any hesitations.

"

  OnePlusNord is amazing phone... It's sound quality is too good and screen is also good... Overall all things are best but only bettery reducing fast is only minus point of this phone ...Some camera sample is given here ... It's low light photos are super ...fabulous pics give in low light photo... Security system are also amazing...

"
"

  I took phone since three days the phone is being switched off by itself and mobile is not power on.Don't buy this phone

"
"

  I was so excited when I received OnePlus Nord yesterday . But after exploring basic features I am really disappointed, Not expected this team OnePlus . Below are the few concerns after using 1 day1. Camera quality is not upto the mark, it will worse than 15k phones2. Battery getting drained too fast3. Average look4. Not worth for the money at all .

"
"

  Excellent, superb performance I have seen many YouTubers saying Bad about this mobile..But really I'm saying stunning performance mobile very smooth & in hands looks great..I have brought 12gb ram 256gb Rom.. if anybody thinking to buy this Definitely u will satisfy this worth for our money..

  Honest review..üí•Purchased on 25 aug received on 30 aug morningNeed some packaging improvement by still okCamera quality is good only front camera is unstable OnePlus will fix this issues by ota update..still better thanw realme or redmi phone (including lot's of ads) you can trust OnePlus rather than realme UI ..Along battery life is good not draining on night standby for meAnd the tint issues is at only bottom side .. Little bitAt Last thing think about Oxygen OS or Realme UI you will never regret on Oxygen

"
"

  Good product  but trust me  not worth 30000 lots of important is required on this product.1 screen resolution is not healthy for eyes. One cannot look continus to screen it effect eyes.2 while recording any call it's announced to both that your call is being recorded. Which should not be a familiar features3 as heard earlier. Even multiple updates Camraa quality is not at par.4 if I have worth to spend 30k or more then lost of other branch are there in India which can opet to avoid above.

"
"

  Worst experience ever never expected these kind of quality oneplus the crack which I have posted its shocking bcoz it has dropped from a height below the knee that too with the case on this will be my last product from oneplus hats off for your quality and support guys

"
"

  Camera would have been better... Only issue...i m waiting for software optimisation...ü§ûü§û but oxygen os rocks üëåüëåüëåüëå battery life is good for average user.. No warmth issue for sure... Damn sure value for money if they address the camera

"
"

  Best:1) Build quality2) Magnificent display3) Fast ChargingMedium:1) Camera2) battery lifeNot that good:1) On screen Fingerprint scannerOverall best in 20k-30k range

"
"

  The camera is very good. Battery life is decent. The refresh rate and fingerprint reader are upto the Oneplus mark.

"
"

  I would simply say this phone is what u would prefer for ur daily usage.Everything just works fine for me.For those who are complaining about the camera,I don't know what actually is there problem,as if they are going to do some professional photgraphy with this.I don't find any problem like display tinting and anything with the camera as well,until u don't compare it with others.The camera will just do it's work.Nothing can be just perfect.Just go for it if gaming is not the only purpose of ur life....

"
"

  Very good phone. Without any competetion at this price.Was using op7 before it, switched it's performance it a bit lower than OP7 but looks are good.

"
"

  Overall inhand feel is awesome,Battery and charger is super,Issue with front and back cameraSelife camera show your face white n black screen in normal light,Image is blurry....

"
"

  I am so lazy to write a review  for any of my orders in the past few years. But this phone bought with a total of 32k (along with insurance for 12GB version) fully disappointed me. Writing this after one month of usage. I had better experience with me Redmi.Repeatedly hangs outBrowser performance is the worstAudio is poorAll other functions are same as other phones. No need to buy this much of a costly phone for an avg performance like a 13k mobile.

"
"

  The phone is good. However LED brightness control is controlled using PWM (pulse width modulation). Meaning instead of turning the brightness of One plus Nord turns of the screen and on for 240 times or so per second. This one way of reducing brightness in LED display. The problem is when you scroll the screen images are torn. This happens in fractions of seconds, for some this may give eye strain and headache. This can be captured by taking recording the display  from another mobile or camera in slow motion. I regret buying this phone.

"
"

  Completely disappointed got a defective item the speaker of the phone is not working although they refund my money but got a defective piece from a brand like one plus it sucks!!

"
"

  Do not buy this mobile at all.  This mobile's camera is very bad.  And the android update is the worst.The 2 cameras of this mobile specially so called Macro are useless.The google chrome also NOT WORKING in this mobile.the worst funny part of this mobile is when you starting and stoping to record a call then software will inform about that action by voice message.. I mean what the hell is this. if I am want to record a call that means that is secret.. and your software  inform that person about that.. finger print reader is very slow.

"
"

  After using more than a week i feelCameras average. 2MP micro camera is literally sucks. 5MP dept cam is for namesake.Main camera takes good shots in day-time.Battery life is very good.Fingerprint scanner is avarage.Refreshrate not smoother as expected.Processor is small upgrade of 730G dont expect like flagship performance. Decent at gaming no heating Thanks for good optimization. Final verdict this phone is over priced... better go with 730g processor Mobile with stock Android will feel same experience.

"
"

  The only reason why Nord isn't wonderful is that it's overhyped before launch. Other than that it's the best one could at this price. I read tons of reviews before purchasing.Got it delivered yesterday and it's been great experience till now. The oxygen os is lit. The camera works decent for normal usage. Display is great and battery drains a little faster but you can charge it quickly as warp charging is available. Gaming is recent. Build quality is good.If you want a device that does well in all aspects go for it!

"
"

  Phone wi fi is not working it's automatically disconnect and connect and not working battery drain less than 30 percent in configuration only, not able to copy date from old mobile even after install app in old mobile

"
"

  Battery life is not upto the mark at all.3-5 hours of screen timeWhat is the point with all the other features if battery is not lasting sufficient time.

  The OnePlus Nord is a fantastic mid-range smartphone, and one that betters its main competition in a number of ways.From its large number of cameras to its 90Hz refresh rate, 5G, AMOLED screen, slick software and modern, mostly premium design, this phone packs in an awful lot for not very much money.It‚Äôs clear where cost taking about 28000rs modeland batter life very disappointment because when your open the camera take to high resolution video recode that the time battery life is down quickly ...

  1.Green tint issue (you will be happy untill you notice greentint issue.)2.when you are using bluetooth headset it will disconnect anytime without any indication.3.poor night mode screen display.4.Not happy with this product.Dosent Recommended!!!1.screen is sensitive and working fast2.Thatsall.

  Excellent speed and offcourse good camera, but did not tested 5G speed because of non-availability of 5 g sim. Overall good mobile by 1+.

"
"

  The phone is pretty good with best camara quality...but battery performance is not so good..  but ONEPLUS give us not so much best quality as compare with oneplus 8 or 7 series

"
"

  I am writing this review after 15 days of usage. So far things gave been good and this is my first oneplus device. Oxygen Os is super clean and display is top notch. Camera is decent and battery life is good too. The alert slider looks delicate though while shifting. Overall great value for money !

"
"

  1. fingerprint reader recognises and unlocks mobile.2. Batery life is regularly normal since I've used for one day, I couldn't find any big drop in battery with regular use even I played pubg, used camera, watched video etc.3. I have seen many reviews mentioning the display issue, there are no display issues. I am also using dark mode with less brightness.4. Delivery system needs to be improved, I ordered product on 7th and got delivered by 25th only. In between this duration there where 2 open sales for this product.

"
"

  I brought one plus nord 12 gb model from amazon.The return policy last date is 16 sep. After 2 days from return my phone is switched off automatically and not working. I tried to contact amazon and also oneplus toll free number, service center in kerala. I cant reach none of the abov. What will i do with this non working phone. Worst service in my life.... one plus has the  worst service in cellullar field. We cant contact Amazon for any emergency. When tried to contact them. The automatic call  says contact the website or app.

"
"

  Pros:Camera quality is good.Phone speed is good no lags.Phone gets cahrged quickly.Cons;Battery life is worst in this phone. Even when phone is in idle state , the battery gets drained very fast.There seems to be flickering when I use the dark themes while browsing.

"
"

  Facing issues with screen mirroring Netflix videos, getting only black screen and audio, although they have a L1 certification. Not sure if this issue is only with my phone or everyone else.Otherwise the phone Works well...

  Fast mobileWith updates OnePlus will make this product great (hope so)Now battery life is not satisfactoryBut charging speed is fabulousGot it for 27999/-Got the Jerry rig everything cover for 790/- at OnePlus.in90Hz screen is awesomeSound is also loud but lacks stereo speakersFront camera is not satisfactoryRear camera is okayAlert slider feels bit looseApps open fastStorage gets full continuously

"
"

  ¬†I am facing a major issue for the mobile purchased one month before.After buying it, within one week itself mobile rebooted automatically.Again after one week more it is totally in a dead condition.So now I am sad to  inform you that I didn't even get any service or replace my item from one plus service centre.Due to this issue I am sad to say that my interest to purchase any products from Amazon had totally gone.After onwards I have to rethink before buying any products from Amazon

"
"

  Battery life is ok not extremely good... Camera is worst I have never seen such worst camera... Camera can't handle proper lights.. slightly heating issues... Sensor are very strong.... 3.5 mm jack is not available... Sound adjustment and brightness adjustments are poor.

"
"

  Nice productWorking good & experience is nice to have itBattery backup is also superbRefresh rate also awesomeCharging is very fast, 100% in just 40 minutesHappy to have it.

"
"

  Overall Best Phone In Price Segment .But I received phone with minor scratch on camera lens üòû . I Haven't replaced phone as there will be scratch in future .OnePlus should Focus on quality manufacturing.And one More , Battery Is draining fast , hope problem will solve in upcoming update .

"
"

  Recently got an update for my oneplus nord, after upgrading I'm facing severe network issues, usually I had an speed of l-3mbps unfortunately now It's running in kbps, kindly help me out, also I had an doubt whether there's an issue with network service provider but my homie is using same service provider and he is having good network. So problem is with recent update. How to proceed üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è didn't expect this kind of service from OnePlus I contacted customer service care the problem is still  not cleared help me out!!!

"
"

  Remaining everything is great but the device have a serious screen tinting issue... for those who don't understand this it means that blacks don't look black om the phone eather it looks like light green or sometimes dark pink...insterd of 3 updates still this issue is not resolved...Other than that everything is fine

"
"

  WellGood product, overall performance is great but still in this range there very poor display ppi , camera is worst(if OnePlus optimization will update it can be modified) , a neat and clean oxygen o.s as expected.Overall at this range I mean 28000 , there are lots of good options, if you're OnePlus freak just like me.... You can buy this phone ...And someone asking about k20pro my suggestions is definitely go to k20 pro..

"
"

  Defective product. Mic not working and battery getting charged 10% in 2 hours. Plus the phone is heating up constantly. Had put a replacement request to Amazon but after 10 calls with customer care, replacement was cancelled due to product unavailability. Refund post return was processed but no one is coming to pick the phone. Ordered this for my fiance who is going to US and will be without a phone because of this!!Ridiculous experience. Not expected from One Plus and surely not from Amazon. Really poor.

"
"

  Overall phone experience is good and one can consider this(if in budget). Display is good, speakers are decent (although there is only one), battery is average, and rear camera with GCam is Best I have used(shared some samples), but front camera at night is on the lower side (but maybe they might improve it in future).

"
"

  1.camera quality is not good2.issue with display is there while using low brightness level--a purple tint occurs when background is ash ,grey or black colour3. brightness issue is there4.it says full charge in 30 min but it not truenever expected this issues from oneplus,very disappointing

"
"

  1) My only disappointment is with battery life. It last barely a day with full charge. When I read about 7nm Semiconductor, I thought battery life would be better but sadly this wasn't the case.2) Camera could have been better but I am not gonna make a fuss about it. It gets the job done.

"
"

  Some technical problems. When i try to see recently opened app its gose top of the screen after that i can't able to operate the phone. recently opened app stayed at top of the screen. You have only choice to lock the phone and unlock.Kindly do something about that. And many other problems with os or something.

"
"

  All over it's an immense package of speed with style. Fingerprint reader is quiet fast. Camera can be improved with future updates although it's very good as of now. Battery life is bareable as 30W Warp charger charges up the device really quick. The back is also glass with Gorillla Corning glass so you can use it without a back cover. I am Completely satisfied with The Oneplus Nord.

"
"

  One of the good phone under 30K cost. Happy with the Google default applications and performance. If you compare this product with any of the same cost phone, you'll end up with more positive things. But don't compare with other products having cost greater than 35K / 40K. For normal users, it'll be the best phone according to me.

"
"

  I suggestion NOT TO BUY.If your luck doesn‚Äôt favours you you face the problems mentioned below.Over rated hard ware specUnder quality software. Phone gets auto reboot , looses data. And coming to camera , there is a lag, you get the click sound but the later moment is getting captured.When using camera phone gets heated up. Called customer care about these issue, they recommend factory reset.... but in vain.

"
"

  All features are good except phone battery.Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery.

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus phone and I wanna tell OnePlus that their quote of (Never Settle) is actually true because this phone is a flagship killer phone for camera, speakers, display and the 90hz refresh rate this is a monster in the hands of professional photographers and what I disliked about it is the gaming qualityIt cannot run PUBG at 60fps and the battery life pretty good and the fingerprint reader & the face unlock is fast AF!!!!!!!!!! Thats all I wanted to say (THANK YOU ONEPLUS I LOVED THIS PHONE)

"
"

  Every thing is working fine.But there is battery drain issue in my device. Planning for replacement. Will use for 2 more days and then decide. I hope OnePlus will address battery drain issue in an update.Battery drained from 86% to 76% in night, when the phone was idle. This is serious issue.

"
"

  Hy, I am Madan PuriI purchased OnePlus Nord... it's been 2 day to had this phone and today I have display problem which seems my half display is not working and half will work and then I restarted my phone it will works. I can't  understand  what's  the problem. I can't  except  form OnePlus Nord to had this problem that I faced today. And one more thing I saw in is phone front camera is have some glitchy issue and video on front camera shows darken black light. I'm  really not satisfied with this phone.

"
"

  Can't zoom while using front camera.Video croped while watching videos on youtube when set up as complete zoom and can't watch on full screen without zooming.Same problem facing on Amazon prime, mx player.Details are not clear at after 7x zoom.Portrait mode is good.Video recording is also good.Battery backup is normal also can say good.Colour disbalance can be seen on complete screen in low light at display brightness is lowest.Camera performance in night is good

"
"

  Its an awesome phone and the great thing about this phone is Oxygen os with fluid amoled display. Camera is good but not awesome. It just average. And ya performance is great. Battery life is also decent could be enough for entire day. Its dash charger can charge phone really fast.Screem protector that is already applied is not good. You need to change it. Overall a good package phone.I pre ordered it on 15 july and waiting for that assured gifts. Let see when it comes.

"
"

  Feel bad to buy this, instead of this,I had many options but I trust one plus despite all this, the nord has nothing extraordinary,all these features we can get in 15k-20k range.I bought one plus nord on last month but I feel bored bcz ofHang in 8+128 versionMany times fingerprint sensor do not work so I unlock with passcodeBattery life is too short for internet user as full charge ends in very few hoursOnly good thing about nord is fast chargeOverall: Feel disappointed üëé

"
"

  Performance : Good as expectedBattery : with fast charging it's good enoughDisplay : Just awesomeCamera : video is distorted sometimes on 4k rest is average Overall a good Phone

"
"

  Mind-blowing purchase of mine in all time. Smooth, fluent, fast. Camera is also spectacular. So, as well everything in it. It's a beast in this price segment. And obviously the soul of this beast Oxygen OS is the reason why it's different from others and why it's unique. Just loving and enjoying it.

"
"

  No doubt Oneplus product is good, this particular model is average to good, not very good.  Amazon delivery of this product is worth giving one star, extremely late, my request and review was striked off saying Amazon fulfilled, but the fact is they did not fulfil the delivery date promise!

"
"

  I gifted this phone to my sister.She love it.The camera could have been a little more better but it's not that bad . The device is slim making it easier and comfortable to hold.Battery is decent.Screen quality too.She uses it for gaming and heard no complaint about gaming.Overall the device is good

"
"

  Good looks premium.No display issue. phone camera is average.Video recording is good.I just bought only for Oxygen OS but dialer pad is poor using of Android . doesn't looks good at all.After all i like phone. Go for it

"
"

  Nord has covered ever aspect of a well deserved smartphone. There are few negative vibes about the vibration motor and speaker, i was using realme phone before purchasing this. Trust me it's far better then realme. Oxygen OS is so much better.

"
"

  Camera and Battery performance is below expectations. OnePlus disappointed this time. But still it's better looking then other company phones.

"
"

  Great product at this price point. Enjoying using the phone. Only complain will be battery life. But that too increases if u put the display at 60hz and honestly doesn't make much of a difference. Camera is average. Use snapseed to get a perfect edit and shot.If buying this phone solely for camera, then there are other vfm phones available to be considered.

"
"

  Let's get straight to the point everything is great except the camera that too in low-light conditions, in low light conditions it is so bad that it looks cartoonised though gcam fixes it whereas it is brilliant outdoors and just like every android it laga a little on snapchat videosOverall a good buy!

"
"

  Writing this review after using my phone after 2weeks Display is very nice, processer is really very good, Phone get charge in 50mins, Battery need to charge twice a day, Camera is awesome specially night mode, micoro lence camera could have been better and it may be improved after few updates, Selfie with splash mode are good, 8gm Ram and 128 gb internal memory is enough one can go for itThank you

"
"

  My son is thoroughly enjoying the product and it's performance. At this price point the phone is performing great. The camera, battery, performance are great. The display is good. And the phone is firmly designed.

"
"

  1) Camera quality of front camera is not so hyper as the onep plus show that its a 32megapixel2) Battery is draining without using the phoneI have used redmi note 6 pro, 7 pro, lenovo k8 note and asus zenfone max pro m1But they never disappointed me in that range.. So very bad experience about the one plus nord from its battery sectionSo i am going to change my phone if they not change the batteryRest all is good on an average but u should must check it's camera n battery

"
"

  The battery life is a bit short but the warp charge makes it charge so quick that you won't feel the problem. The display is perfect, everything is just s perfect, from hardware to software so good, the camera is so good and the low light camera works quite well. Worth your money folks!

"
"

  Camera Focus is not so good in detail in protrait mode

  Writing review after 20 days of usage.Nord nice PhoneFor someone looking good brand and Quantity in lower price .+ Have good memory+ Ram is good enough+ Very  light in weight+ Lovely colour.But if u get Lower pricesThen you have to compromise onüëâbuilt quality Plastic bodyüëâ Cameraüëâ Battery lifeOverall I found it really goodMy dad is really happy using this phone.Overall good phone in price range of 20k to 30k

"
"

  Using OnePlus Nord for 1 week I can say that it's worth my money. I think for it's price range it's enough RAM and internal storage.Performance is also great.Only think concerning about this phone is camera but camera optimization can be tweaked by GCam app. I have tried it myself, and astrophotography is amazing.Overall I am happy with this phone.üòÄ

"
"

  Don't purchase it very low end device in high cost.My redmi note 8 pro was performing far better than this.In package display issue display looks pale.Pubg won't even run in high graphic and hd audio and I paid 30k for this crap device.Put some extra and go for 8 or 8 pro.Waste of money

"
"

  was little nervous while buying bcoz i have seen so many videos talking about camera quality and pointing out cons of nord but after getting this device i came to know about only one con which is speaker it is good only when volume is full otherwise u will have to struggle in hearing but overall phone is good worth spending 30k and camera is awesome i have compared it with one plus 8 pro and u can easily point out the difference that camera on one plus nord is far more better than one plus 8 pro.

"
"

  Good performance so far. Battery drains when used in 90hz refresh rate. You will get a good experience even in 60hz refresh rateCamera could have been better.Video recording is perfect in this phone. Processor speed is very good and no lags. I am not a gamer so no comments about it.Call reception is very good. No heating issues so far.Go for it if you are looking for a better performance phone that can help you in your day today activities and support you with all office related apps

"
"

  battery drains very speed.its my fault or any body facing same issue. i dont understand, i have received mobile on 2nd Aug, its charged from 0 to 100 in 63 min yesrterday ,but 100-8% in 16 hours only.with  norml usage only ..am expecting min 24hours back up.back cam is good ,and  front is also good..all features works well.but why battery darins in that speed? it is bug  or default mobile piece.

"
"

  Pretty AWESOME pHONE aT cURRENT pRICE tag. But seems to HAVE Software issues Since Phone Sometimes, reboots itself and Software Crashes, oftenly. I hope ONEPLUS Did notice those BUGS At their COMMUNITY Forum & will likely to fix Via  OTA  UPDATES in  near Future.Also People ,Who are Downgrading From premium  Smartphone to this Phone, will feel disappointed.Best f LUCK Oneplus Team.

"
"

  Not good camera

"
"

  Premium look... lightweight...(grey onyx) superb ..

"
"

  I won‚Äôt over sell this product but it is the beat mid range phone available now. Better than Samsung M and A series. I would always go for snapdragon processors than any home built processors.Looks good for the price and worth it

"
"

  Seriously OnePlus u shodnt do that to ur customers...the ph is overall good but the most worst thing I can't even bear is the camera front wala...disgusting it feels like we are going back to the 2 megapixel era with a big punchhole design...u hve gone mad bro or fooled us by creating this kind of huge hype

"
"

  Pre-ordered on July 28th, and delivered on Aug 3rd l, before actual sale!!Phone is very good in terms of apps and games performance, smooth display, battery life, Oxygen OS, front camera. Back camera is not that great or at par with flagships, but still it takes pretty good photos under normal conditions, so on usual days, it will work great.Only complaint is regarding bloatwares of Facebook and Netflix apps. That could have been avoided to keep the OS as clean as possible.

"
"

  I really don't know why this phone is not giving me a good instagram experience. I scroll through insta a lot. But in this phone, the stories are mostly blur, the theme keeps changing, and many more problems I guess I'll realise in near future. Also, the volume button takes a little time to respond, it's not instant. Plus, I wish the colour blue would have been the way they showed. A little disappointed but okay. It's a good value for money.

"
"

  Writing this review after a 1.5month of usage....After 2 updates the rear camera quality has increased but for selfies i still  prefer GCAM. Speakers are loud and good. 90hz display is something else probably the best feature of this phone. Battery backup is good. I get around 7-7.5hrs for normal usage and phone gets charged in 65-70mins. I haven't Noticed any lags whatsoever. Oxygen OS nails the software experience. In hand feel is premium.Overall all a very good daily driver.

"
"

  Phone is pretty good. The Marble Blue colour is very eye catching. I'm writing this review after 15 days use. Two OTA updates are already provided for this phone. The problem with new update is that the charging is slow compared to the new one. The new one plus nord went 0 to 70 percent in just 30 mins. But now, it take 0 to 70 percent in 50 mins. Remaining all things are at there best. FP sensor is very fast. The phone has never hung. The phone never got heated. Front camera is also good.

"
"

  The one plus is still not ready to address the tint issue. It is kind for pretty much annoying the display will be turned to pink and green. The one plus community says that its a property of amoled,which i didnt find in any of the samsung devices. If you are still going for this phone then make sure that you are ready to live with this aweful display. As i dont think that they are going to do anything about it. Cheers.

"
"

  Review after 1 week of usage ....Excellent phone with awsome camera ...No bloatware .... Very good battery life .30W fast charging is really quick.Fits perfectly in the hands .Build quality is very good ... Looks very premium.Overall phone to user interface is very clean ... Really happy with my NordJust go for it ..

"
"

  Nice phone for the users who have medium to high usage. Would not recommend for the user who is expecting too much out of it. I would give 4.5 rating. -0.5 is because of camera quality onlywhich company mentioned to be of flagship i.e OnePlus 8 (which is not obviously). Other stuff are just perfectly fine.

"
"

  My OnePlus NORD heated abnormally sometime if just Youtube is playing it starts heating. Contacted amazon customer, they did diagnosis and found device temperature is more than 48degree(48.6).More than 45 degree temp may affect CPU, i got green tinted device. Although i got refund for this as replacement was not available. May be it is heating because of green tinted display(I DON'T KNOW).THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING NORD

"
"

  Not value for money product .Reasons-1.Not best both camera, just average camera like poco or realme phone.2. Not best battery backup , if u can use internet 4 to 5 hours then it not give best performance.3.everythings is simple like redmi or realme phone.4. Only oxygen is best but nothing much better.I can't satisfaction for this phone .5. Sound is not good it is very bad quality.6. Display tint issue .7. Heating issue on this phone.

  Please read . I have exchanged my poco f1 to Nord . This OnePlus Nord is havi very bad camera compre to poco f1 . It's having 32 mp camera selfie . This kinda of 5mp camera . Camera performance under 10k mobile . Please don't buy . If you are getting good  camera then only buy . Remaining everything is ok . But camera very very bad . 0* for camera 0000000 details on camera . If it's zoom in the photos it's all blur no details . Bakavas üò†

"
"

  Good but no connectivity to ear phones and it over reacted in capturing photos in various weather conditions that made me surprised swtuching from iOS but end of the day you get for what you pay. iOS is my best experience so far with security features and simplification! Go for Nord from budget perspective.

"
"

  Today morning I received this phone.. it's too early to said anything about this phone.. but looks wise this phone beats everyone in this segment and performance till date superb..

"
"

  I have received a defective piece.Hardware seems good but software is creating problems.Sound is not properly distributed while playing games and proximity sensor is not working

"
"

  total waste product, the camera is not good, screen is flickering all the time, battery is not good, also they told they will give me 5000ra gift worth of, but i haven't received nothing,fake marketting. worst oneplus will never buy any mobile again on oneplus

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very slow.even sometimes my fingerprints get denied. Batter performance is also very bad and the battery of this phone doesn't give any backup. It last for only 4 to 5 hours with full charge. Camera performance is ver bad specially with portrat mode n deph feature. And one more problem vch am facing is my call waiting is activated still am not getting calls. I am talking to someone thwn other person gets my phone busy Rither then waiting.

  Very Nice phone in this price range .. main positive point is Build Quality , Oxygen OS ...Camera is Okies not excepting flagship quality anyway but overall is Good..Battery life is Good and Smooth screen make experience more nice ...

"
"

  Team Oneplus you guys have done well for this Nord mobile. Stylish, sturdy, premium look, speed, storage I mean everything. I would recommend people to go for this phone, its 10 days of usage for me and beleive me it's awesome.

"
"

  I have experienced the best performance as this is my first One Plus smartphone-Fingerprint reader is dam quick.-Battery life is good it last a day with normal usage and lasts upto 6-7 hours after heavy usage. It get full charged within a hour so its great.-Camera quality is good but not best need for improvement.-Oxygen Os is a excellent os I can say after using this amazing phone-Highly recommended by me to anyone who is in search of best smartphone.

  ¬†Hey OnePlusThis time you disappointed meMy one plus Nord is rebooting automatically when I was stuck in emergency hospitality condition...it's been 12 time when it was automatically rebooting ..Why this happened to me.

"
"

  The camera for both videos and pictures comes really bad, at this price you should get atleast an average cemera quality phone. I was really really disappointed in it. Also in dark theme mode the screen flickers and that too a phone that has been just 2weeks old. overall I would give just 1star.

"
"

  ¬†3 issue I have observed with BluetoothI have connected Boat Airdropes with Nord while in active call soany time reconnection happened..same Airdropes working fine with other devices.. please fix Bluetooth related issues in upcoming release..My battery drained from 100 % to 11% I have used mbl just for 5hrsLocation icon is always showing on screen when actually it it turned off

"
"

  Nice product, but facing issues in battery life camera quality is not good as expected and all the oneplus 's phones are having a problem in sound and power buttons not function properly after 1.5 year. Both Speaker volume also becomes very very low

"
"

  1st of all  i will say AweeesssoooommmeeeeePROS1) Compact one hand usable2) Display (Amoled-with 90Hzh)3) Software ExerienceCONS1) Both 2mp ca,era worthless2) Display fluctuates color during Night mode3) The software experience is not smooth as it was in Oneplus 74) 90Hzh sucks your battery like hell even 60hzh though minimum of 4 to 5 hour screen time you will get with normall internet(4g) usage.5) NFC doesn't work properly.

"
"

  I had purchased OnePlus nord in pre booking from Amazon which had started from 28th july. All the features of the phone are very impressive, but the company should have given 1 ear phone with nord.

"
"

  Not so good I m so sad auto call recording options is no available in this this is very bad things if possible kindly returns my fone and no so good fone it's Avery mobile only hype is there

"
"

  I am reviewing after 10days of use . The phone's speed and refresh rate is mind blowing . The charging is really fast . And the 256gb storage is really best at this budget price . Camera is also cool. We don't need a SD card too . They give a 50gb free cloud storage and The sound quality is also good . Finally The most liked thing is the packing .

"
"

  Worst product, seems like 10,000 Rs product. Waste of money, as battery life is worst. It got charged fast as well as drain super fast. If it's 100% charged, it reduces to 10-20% battery level within 5-6 hours without heavy use (no game, video watching). Camera quality is also average. So this is not expected from such costly product. Only good thing is touch screen. But Camera and Battery are critical things.

"
"

  There isn't any notification light. either to show the charging status or to notify calls, messages etc.Camera quality not as expected.The biggest problem with mine nord is the Hanging issue. Despite having 8GB RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G, 2.4 GHz octa-core processor, It got hung while playing Carrom pool and while using Myntra. Haven't even installed any big application or any games of high graphics or storage.

"
"

  Excellent product in affordable cost.

"
"

  Fabulous phone, switched from iPhone and find it extremely fast, smooth and no bloatware. I hated Android for it's bloatware but thanks OnePlus has taken care of it. Only thing I'm missing is iPhone retina display, that is no match anywhere.

"
"

  The cheapest phone in the 5g category. I see people commenting on issues with camera but they should understand that we are purchasing a mobile phone and not a DSLR camera. We should be looking into the voice quality, maybe video clarity and the speed of the processor. The mentioned features are absolutely fine of Nord. I had a given a star less because there is always a scope for improvement on all the aspects.

"
"

  I used to own OnePlus 6 and it's much better than OnePlus nord in every way. It's got headphone jack, it's camera is better, it's wider. It's thinner comparing with nord.Cons: front camera is placed in wrong position so pics are not good at all. It's thicker. It's litte bit slower than OnePlus 6. I

"
"

  It's a very nice smartphone. Camera quality is great, gives crisp and lovely pictures. Better than any other phone I have used till date. Battery charging is just unbelievable. Charges at around 11% every 5 minutes. 100% done in just over 45-50 minutes. Though till date, I have never charged beyond 95%. Do occasionally peek into the OnePlus community to see how others are doing. I am sure no one is unhappy with this product. I am certainly not !!!!

"
"

  Very light, easy to handle, cameras are good I kind of like the ultra wide selfie it's really wide! Ambient display plays a very important role. Fast (since I was using mi A1 before). Excellent performance, quick charge saves a lot of your time. I would have liked it with headphone jack but nevertheless we can use adapters. The headphone equaliser is pretty good. Rest just buy and use itüòâ

"
"

  Please dont buy this product.. Waste of money. The very first day Google play was not working and play service was not updating and any Google apps not working so had to do factory rest.After few days got black line on lockscreen and notification was coming half then again had to clear all cache and setting. Same problem came after few days so had to give for serviceNot satisfied with the product

"
"

  The camera optimization is not good. When I was clicking the pictures from camera. There was some nice shots. But when I was sending the pictures from what's app or any social media apps there was some bluriness in every shots which I have taken from this camera. Please send this feedback to one plus team. Please sort out this problem by any update. Please give update very soon as possible.Thank you.

"
"

  I had very hight expectation with the Camera, more specifically with the front. As we use it more for selfies. But that has disappointed me more. The quality, selfies in low light are pathetic. Don't buy if you are specifically looking for selfie camera. Might be possible it could be an issue with particularly with my device but untill I realise the replacement date was gone. I wish I could replace with another OnePlus Nord.

  Phone heats up to 45 degree cent. Poor camera resolution. Draining battery. Made for earning profits only and not to deliver right product to the customer.

"
"

  Doesn't have FPS updated like other one plus phones. Camera quality lower than POCO X2. Near perfect for gaming, however, occasional issue with wifi connectivity (2.4GHz) faced.Used one plus 6 before this and would obviously recommend one plus 6 above nord. Touch sensors work as good as any other one plus flagship phones.Overall, happy with the phone for now.

"
"

  Type C to 3.5 mm Jack Audio Connector MISSING!!After seeing so many reviews & videos of Nord unboxing, every unboxing included Type C to 3.5 mm Jack Audio Connector but I haven't received with my phone.Phone is pretty impressive to win hearts but at the other hand very much disappointed by not giving such small important parts and saving on such cost cutting.

"
"

  The good thing in this mobile is , Display quality and oxygen Os,Fast charging and Performance also good, Camera performance lacks a little and battery seems to drain sometimes but its okay, Finally If you want  the oneplus experience you can definitely go for it.I loved the Mobile.

"
"

  Mind blowing

"
"

  The overall experience using the phone was satisfying avoiding the camera experience and battery awful front cam which is giving me an experience that I am using a low-end cam maybe u can solve this issue through future updates. I am also expecting much more battery backup incoming days than the first day.The display and UI experience is outstanding I am having a happy mood while using the phone .I am giving a thumbs up for the phone expect the camera area

"
"

  There is a time gap between the snaps clicked and the one saved.Like, if a click a snap when I smile.. the shutter sound is heard. The image saved in the gallery has my normal face instead of the smiling one. There is a time gap between the shutter sound and the clicking & saving of images

"
"

  A good phone in this segment. The phone is pretty fast and I don't see any lag while playing PUBG as well. Camera is good. But finger print reader is not great. It doesn't detect the finger print all the time.

"
"

  I thought it was best budget phone I ordered realms X3 super zoom and cancelled it thinking this would be a better choice but it did not meet my expectations I had rwalme 1 series using since 2.6yrs and phone is absolutely amazing till now apart from display quality which is usual with LCD screens not asbright as amoled now I regret my selection of this brand not sure if Amazon had option to exchange it

"

Would suggest this phone to anyone coming from a mid-range device and want a flagship-like feel..............................

"
"

  I'm not a heavy user,I don't play games.use it for for WhatsApp chatting,fb,insta,Twitter and make a phone call.Pros: screen quality is awesome,light weight,no tint issues.fast charging is great,fingerprint reader is not bad, battery backup is also good but not the best.the phone also looks premium in hand.Cons: camera is average,not as advertised,use of Google camera may result a Better photo quality.other than that it is the best you can get under 30k

"
"

  Everything is great about this phone !absolutely lovingIt ...While using phone in dark mode with low brightness there's a  that  tint issue  that everyone is talking about(it's the only con I could find)  if use use light mode it won't be there

"
"

  Very bad experience. Display shows green and white flashes over half the screen in whatsapp and fb.Not able to use it. Serious issue. Have asked for return.Hope they refund my money.

"
"

  Quality and camera performance doesn't justify the pricing as 7t sensor is still being there and not worth,just 65w charging gimmick which 15k phone has nowadays,no wireless charging,ip rating and poor camera,not worth for price offered!

"
"

  When u use the oxygen os u just forgot others os ....it's a very friendly mobile ....nd touch quality ... screen quality is really aswam ....if u find a best quality allrounder mobile ..I suggest u to go for it ...playing pubg HD mood....it's could be better...atherwise everything in this mobile is perfect....using sony camera 48 mp is really good for mobile photography....if u want just a 5g phone then don't go for it.

"
"

  Finger print- AwesomeBattery Life- Average, I have Honor 8X too which works better than this device in terms of battery usage.Camera- The Camera is worst in this cost range, no clarity , blurred on a little zoom. The performance is third grade even in daylight.Processor and Speed- Awesome, no problem at all.Speakers- AverageMic- The best in this price rangeGrip- Best in this price range.

"

  Have a purple or green dot on my nord beside the from camera , is this a problem ??? Someone do reply

"
"

  (Upper images are 1. Nord Mobile (30,000), 2. is M31 (15,000 Rs)To,One plus team,What the hell u did with camera. Where is Natural colour in you camera (Front and Back Both).Awesome Mobile with compromised Camera. U just made it like Oppo, Vivo cams (full brightness only).Front camera is poor than 2 MP camera of Apple cams.Kindly update this, else Nord series going to be consider worse launch by One plus.

"

  Facing display tint issue in dark environment...‚Ä¢ On My 1st customer care enquiry- company said its hardware issue and will not affect the performance...‚Ä¢ On my 2nd customer care enquiry - company said our team is working on it will try to resolve it...‚Ä¢ On my 3rd customer care enquiry - company said its software issue and will be fixed on upcoming ota update...ONEPLUS is not clear with there own devices or maybe hiding the truth...

"
"

  Con: Battery Life - Battery life for this phone is good. However, after using Redmi previously, I expected the battery life to be better. Charging time is quite low due to warp charge but battery doesnot last more than 24 hours (even without listening to music or gaming).Pro: Multitasking - Performance is very good with multiple apps running at the same time. There is no visible lag while switching from one app to another or returning to home screen.

"
"

  Excellent product from ONE PLUS. Finger print reader is so sensitive and hence so quick. Long lasting Battery performance. Regarding camera both front and reverse are non comparable. I love NORD. REALLY....

"
"

  ¬†Overall brilliant product!Bought it as a gift for my mom she loved it!Amazon looks and designThe new one plus nord has 4 rear cameras and 2 front camerasIt has in display finger print sensorThe phone looks very classy and has great featuresWith 8 gb ram and a total of 128 GB internal storage it is the best at its price!

"
"

  Value for money smartphonePros1.Battery life is excellent2.pubg can be played for 6 hours from 100% to 15%.3.Butter smooth experience even in 60hz4.camera quality is good and it will be good in updates5.No tint issues in my device.6.Finger print and face unlock is fast.Cons1.No headphone jack2.plastic frame

"
"

  ¬†I really disappointed when I  see camera videos. I didn't expect such bad Camera quality from one plus, it's really bad quality in slow motion at night. Please one plus check it out and replace everones mobiles, to maintain your dignity in market. Over all Nord is good.

"
"

  The phone is very good and lightweight for mid-range users to high range users. Gaming is also very good. I am recommending to use 12gb ram one because the processor is 765g so that ram can help it for the performance. So my overall review is excellent and it is worth buying it.

"
"

  I was using this phone since 10 days. It's was really good experience. But only thing front camera it is very disturbing while watching videos or movies like taking some space. If it not there over here then it will be very good. Overall experience was good. And also back camera was good and front camera was not much good because it's wide angle is only 8mp. So , here we expect more clarity. Gaming experience was good for normal gamers.

"
"

  Proximity sensor is not in this phone so when you call anybody the screen background is always On.2. When you record any call it's speak the call recording is on. So, the call receiver know that the call is recording. It's is a bigger drawback.One plus ,please solve this issues.

"
"

  Cons:-1) The 48mp camera takes dull and contrasty pictures.2) Macro camera is useless.3) After playing music or videos on full sound the area of the speaker gets heated up a little.4) After clicking a picture it takes time to load the picture for viewing.Pros:-Everything is fantabulous. I have to say oxygen os is very smooth. And also the processor being 765g performs pretty well.

"
"

  For the normal day to day usage this is one of the best phone under this price segment. I really enjoyed oxygenOS with a lot of customisation.You can literally change your UI with your colour combinations and you will not get bored by seeing the same UI.Camera quality is great according to me and nightscape work like a charm.Screen,battery and weight of the phone is just amazing

"
"

  I purchased this phone on August 6 and it was delivered to me on Amazon on Fast 12 date.This phone is very good.  It has great potential.  Its camera and its battery are very good.  Its design is also very good.  It looks great.  The quality of this phone is very good.I bought it through Amazon. I always love shopping from Amazon and I always receive good quality products through Amazon.Thanks for Amazon!

"
"

  ¬†3 words for this phone - ""Just loved it""Awesome - 90Hz refresh rate üëåSuperb - Multi-taskingNice - Camera quality (vivid, saturated & crisp images)Video stabilization - ExcellentAnd ofcourse OnePlus experience is OnePlus experience.No competition.And after all upcoming updates for few things will be looked after by Google.

"
"

  Type c port is not working properly for type c headphone.Loudspeaker glitch issue. When you speak on loudspeaker suddenly voice converted into normal. But option still show as loudspeaker. And never set as loudspeaker if you tap again on loudspeaker.

"
"

  Dissatisfied with Camera performance, I don't think it's really 48MP, i think its 5MP, Also Face unlock is slower than my previous Oneplus 6T....Oneplus has messed up big timeThe reason why I like oneplus is because of oxygen OS & Samsung made 90hz DISPLAYI suggest Oneplus don't get Sony IMX next time go for something else

"
"

  I pre-ordered it and used it for past 7 days...Performance wise no doubt it's a fantastic phoneOnly thing is low light photo was not that great but an update for oneplus made it fixed to a greater extend.The camera hardware is capable of taking a great picture but due to price point I guess manufacturer has reduced it through software...

"
"

  It's awesome I am testing it from one week the battery backup was like 7hrs of continues usage of phone with 4G+,90Hz screen refresh rate and playing games like PUBG, CALL OF DUTY,FREE FIRE.. Coming to the camera it was also good but it is not using the 5MP depth camera it is not a big deal they may fix it with a update but also the depth effect is good finally a killer phone under 30K segment Simply go for it..

"
"

  Worst policy by Amazon. 7 days return policy is available but they are not returning this phone. Mobile performance is not as expected. Headphone jack is not available with this phone. Expandable memory slot is also not available. Battery is drying up so faster.  Laggs during playing games.  This my worst experience facing with Amazon in recent 6 years. Amazon plz return this mobile. I wan to return this mobile as soon as possible.  It is waste of money.

"
"

  Guys please don't accept any negative reviews,I used this product for more than week,It's simply awesome experience the only negative is 765G processor but it's enough good for in this price range, just 2 to 5 seconds lacking is there compare to all the flagship phone.But performance wise it's really beast.Oneplus always keep their promise.Definitely go for worth for your money.

"
"

  Phone is giving me hard time. It bricks every now and then. Switches off automatically and doesn't restart post that. When it does, starts in factory reset mode. Really having pathetic experience with the phone. I have already moved the data from old phone 4 times  but still same issue persists. Been a fan and user of oneplus from last 5-6 year, but not this time. Request you to please arrange for a replacement as soon as possible.

"
"

  Frequent disconnection of Bluetooth headset with the Oneplus Nord phone. The same headset works perfectly fine with Oneplus 6. Seems major bug in Nord series around Bluetooth connectivity.

"
"

  Best mid-range phone. Video quality and stability is awesome. Photo quality is great too for a phone. Those who pixel-peeping and complaining about photo quality, you can't expect much from a tiny sensor of mobile phones.

"
"

  Battery life is not good as expected wastege of money , Bluetooth connectivity not reliable, the about 90 Hz refresh rate is like jst for sale purpose. Disappointed with this phone as my previous Samsung A8 plus much better than this Nord. Go for Samsung M51 or other for the value of money.

"
"

  Performance is great ...But there is some display issues in my variant a greenish tint on top right and purple on the bottom left.If anyone from the oneplus team is seeing this review please help me. How to fix the display issue.

"
"

  Bought this phone a 2 months ago, no regrets at all.the camera is just....too good and the 129hz screen display just makes it better but the only bummer is that there's no head phone but except that this is the best phone to buy under 30,000

"
"

  Worest phone and worest services of amazon ...selfie camara quality is very poor.and amazon customer service is very bad. They are only there for product selling and not for customer satisfaction. I requested them and told  that im not satisfied with oneplus nord and pls take it back and asked them that pls refund the amount to amazon paybalance which enable me to buy mobile again from amazon only but no response from amazon team.

"
"

  I am thanfull to amazon on time delivered my lovely device. Camera and battery backup is totally different from other device and finger print also. Love it ‚ù§

"
"

  You will regret if not going for nord!Camera is best,Gaming Experience Best,Best Sound QualityTint effect bug  on 90hz or 60hz refresh rate not found!And there is a suggestion from my side. Go for 8/128 and above as pics from camera is of larger size.

"
"

  There are some problems with the chrome some times it's not revealing search results till I refresh the whole page, and the phone is draining battery faster, finger print reader is a bit slow it needs an extended contact to recognise finger,camera is good, call drops are increasing day by day I don't know whether it's due to network problem r phone problem, I expected premium quality from one plus family but this has let me down with some basic issues

"
"

  Go for it without a second thought,I was concerned after reading some negative review but trust me you wont regret investing 28k in it.Smooth, Great cameras, Good signal reception and call quality ,staisfying build Quality.

"
"

  Macro and depth camera is just a gimmick.they are not being used with latest Oxygen OS update.their punch tagline is actually true ""if you don't like too many cameras, we've messed it up!""..They really have messed the camera. Other than that, phone is great. I would suggest galaxy M31s over this if your are camera centric. Performance and Camera wise,this is a great phone,but is overpriced.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very fastBattery life is also good it's come 30 watt warp mobile charger just wow...nice oneplusBack Camera quality  day light is also good but night time image quality is  avarage because front camera is not satisfying me sometime is click the image just like photo is sake ......plz oneplus this camera problem fixed the software update ....Good mobile for playing pubg . 765G processor  with her graphics is good .

"
"

  This is the worst phone I have ever bought... Do not go for this phone guys..  Company is Just looting public money and nothing has been provided as compared to cost... Basic features are also not working... Camera is bad... Battery life is worse and my first sim automatically shows no signal. When I turn on and off airplane mode it catches the signal..... I am so so so disappointed with this phone.... Nothing is good about it.

"
"

  I got the product after two weeks of intense waiting but like a tragedy I got a phone with defective speaker. And when I tried to replace the product Amazon told me that there is no replacement option for this product. I am unsatisfied and really sad

"
"

  I've been a one plus user, thus this phone seems pretty easy to use. It's got a great UI. However the fingerprint reader isn't very good. Also the camera could have been better.But apart from that the phone is a classic!

"
"

  On the back panel of the phone, there are air bubbles trapped underneath. No proper customer care services regarding replacements, great disappointment, no follow up on said issues. Had to return the product.

"
"

  Very good mobile ,very nice pictures from camera,selfie is also fantastic,best phone I even operated,I was using I phone 7 but found this mobile Nord is even better in operation and 12 BH ram is giving a nice feel and processor is very fast so every thing is instant,only one Cons is that there is no earphone with handset and no connectors are given for earphone so this is a major drawback

"
"

  The phone is a good attempt by one plus! The main camera works just fine but the macro camera is better not to be used.It's battery does a fine job but not as big as most budget phones that give us 9-10 hours of life. You can use it for atmost 6-8 hours.Price is much higher as compared to other phones with same features but Oxygen OS is a fulfilling ad free, bloatware free OS. That's the best takeaway from this phone.

"
"

  If you use this mobile u will definitely notice difference of your old mobileDisplay clarity is awesome90hz refresh rate ki fidha aypotharu üòåTint issue ayte emi ledhu and iam using dark mode no issuesDisplay and 90hz refresh rate 10/10

"
"

  Best phone under 30k. User experience is buttery smooth. Low Stock camera is a little bit diappointing factor in low lighting condition. But you can correct those issues by using G cam. Overall a great user experience after using the device for1month.

"
"

  one plus nord is working ok . butt cellphone get hitted with 10 minutes...and also disappointed with amazon deals...  while booking the order Amazon was having 20% cashback deal on SBI card payment..but didn't get the cashback money till yet...fake dealss

"
"

  I didn't clicked good pic of the phoneBut the phone is so goodAnd it is so cheapAnd I can say oneplus made a very good mid range segment smartphoneI clicked some photos to I was just so surprised of the quality and the beauty of the picsAnd have to say though it don't have stereo speakers but it is so so loud I sas so surprised when I used it on full volume

"
"

  Battery, on display fingerprint, sound, camera is awesome. But display didn't as good as i thought.  90hz display is good. Bt in regard to brightness , clarity it not so good. But over all okay. One big negative that , not feels premium.

"
"

  One plus nord not good as hype they created, Camera is not good enough.Mobile Data dropping the speed to zero KBs not even 1minute stable connection speed.Bug submitted let see if they can fix it. Lot of bugs with the software. I Personally suggest not prefer one plus nord.

"
"

  The phone is sleek and looks poppy more than elegant. Not something like the ever great OnePlus Flagships. It feels like a OnePlus 3T stuffed into a longer, multi camera phone. Well, 30000 is something you would pay for so I must say that the pricing is at par.

"
"

  Battery life is not upto the mark. The phone is discharging at a very fast rate. I have to charge it twice in the day. It's not even lasting for 24 hours.Rest of the features are great.

"
"

  I buy onepluse Nord just 3 or 4 days ago and I'm regusly user of onepluse nord. After couple of days I'm facing a display bleeding issue. In the above side the camera there is a black dot showing when I open any dark application any one can see clearly that DOT. And I intead of contacted to customer executive but they are not understanding my problem. I told them about that issue. I NEED REPLACEMENT either üò≠ money back. Please response ASAP.

"
"

  The product is very good, infact provided almost all the necessary softwars required.Something I felt unusual is that during charging, my red cable becomes hot. I don't really know that it is a defect or it is happening with everyone.On this device, OnePlus has worked excellently and the most lovely thing about this is that it doesn't takes much time to charge. All over it is a good option but better options are available in the market in this price range.

"
"

  I got delivery on Saturday and from very first day I'm facing heating issue in normal usses and camera is also okay grade. This is completely unexpected from OnePlus. And adding one more point it does not look like much premium in this price range.I'm going to return this gadget.Don't go for brand go with quality.

"
"

  Hello all,I have 12 GB varient it was good choice though refreshing rate is damn smooth with this varient. Haven't checked 8 GB varient yet. But I would suggest if you gonna planing to purchase this go for highest varient. Camera 5 out 5.Just one thing I am not satisfied with the battery life but with the Warp charger it won't be any issue. Charging is way more better than any other devices.Thanks,Bhavesh

"
"

  Only two days after purchase, phone seems good except for the battery which is draining very fast, at the same time, the Warp Charger (included in the box) charging also too fast. Camera is good and the display. Will give more info after some usage

"
"

  Best phone in this segment 765G processor,fluid amoled display, awesome quad camera setup, premium design,good quality back cover and offcourse 30W charger 70% in just half an hour.

"

  It is the most expensive thing I have bought for the first time. And I am happy with what I have received.The display is just mind blowing and the performance is on the marks.And the battery can last upto a day even if you are a heavy user. And too my surprise it charges very very fast. On an average 10% in 5 minutes.Yes the camera is not extraordinary but it is on an average good.#happycustomer

"

  All the things fingerprint reader is working fine,battery goes for more than a day if u don't use location related apps and less gaming,camera quality is on par and it can easily be said best camera yet the clarity and quality are just awesome,gaming mode helps u suppress the notifications..

  Big issue with Oneplus Nord is Bluetooth connectivity. Takes too long to connect bluetooth device, when connected it gets disconnect automatically. Onnplus should work more with bluetooth connectivity as the device do not have earphone jack.Camera quality is not good. Low durability due plastic/fiber frame. Not expected these qualities and issues from Oneplus.OS 10.5.7 is awesome to use.

"
"

  Been my daily driver since August 4th and I am pleased with the performence of the mobile. Changed form s9 plus to Nord and I am happy with it. It's good gives a good feel to it and also the battery is great. Go for it and you will be satisfied.

  First of all: Green and Pink tint issue Sucks to the core..Also the front Camera also sucks..!Advice: Replace all the tinted issue phones and remanufacture them, To get the HUGELY lost GOODWILL Back.. Or else You also drown like other mobile companies. To: CARL Pei

"
"

  Actually I plan to to upgrade from OnePlus 5t to another OnePlus phone. I thought Nord is my choice. I regret for my choice really. Phone battery really really worst. Drain very very fast. I won't play any game. Never installed any game or played. Daily charging my phone two times.Camera: not good. Just using their software showing. Quality not good.I really disappointed. Please go for any other good phone

"
"

  ¬†After 15 days, suddenly the screen started to blink and display becomes hugely faded. Nothing can be seen on display.

"
"

  Only one drawback ...we can't forward video aur image in file manager.......pls if possible resolve it ..otherwise I have to sale my phone

"
"

  It is good for its price and I don't do heavy gaming so I don't any problems with gpu and battery also chages very fast and battery life is really good.I was looking through oxygen os different functins and found them really good.I have also not got ant screen tint issue I checked it thoroughly.some may say it is not good but it depends on what kind of phone are you looking for it had everything that I wanted

"
"

  I love this phone. Everything about it is great. I am not a gamer, and if I were, I would spend more money to buy a phone which had a better chipset. With this price, this phone delivers more than other phones on the market. You have to learn how to use the various features of the camera (which provides amazing shots). Without a doubt the best phone in this price range. I don't know why people are complaing about it.

"
"

  1. No call Recording option.2. No sound clarity3. Phone vibrates on speaker sound.4. front camera üì∏ quality not upto the level5. Rear camera is good when compared with front camera but not so good. To say exactly not like other OnePlus models.6. Batter life OK quality. Stand-by is good, drains fast when playing, chatting....7. No headset jack 3.5mm Overall OK _ Quality phone

"
"

  It is a good phone for the Price,but not outstanding like they hyped about it.Pros:Excellent OSPerformanceGood Display30w Warp ChargeCons:Green and pink Tint issue at dark modeAverage CamerasBad low light images(They Should fix it by update)Average Battery life

"
"

  This time i am very disappoint with one plus just because of nord camera , camera is not upto the mark otherwise the highlight part is screen or display is so good and phone looks premium its not look like a giant phone its look premium and classy otherwise battery performance is average , camera is also just average and otherwise other performance are good . I am expecting may be one plus improve camera image processing in next update.

"
"

  After one month of use I'm writing this review really happy with the product it's a over all a great package....in the segment....The camera is really good and a really awesome as well the Battery life of the phone is ok as per the brightness level u set the charging speed is really awesome and really fast as well really happy with the product...üòä

"
"

  Bluetooth isn't working well.Iam irritated by the Bluetooth functioning.Who don't need Bluetooth can buy it unless don't buy it.There are so many bugs in the working of Bluetooth.After disconnecting Bluetooth also it is showing the Bluetooth symbol in sound management which makes no sound from speaker.Today I tried to down the volume but it didn't .There are soo many bugs in it.

"
"

  Phone looks goodPerformance quite good no prob while PLAYING game like CODScreen looks goodCamera is not great but decent inough hope that will improve with updatePhone is light weightCall quality is goodPhone get quick charge with wrap chargingI have 12gb ram varientAs am used to with it's oxigen Os

"
"

  Oxygen os is the main highlight of this phone. It gives this phone a premium feel. And that's what makes this phone far better than other phones in this price segment. Fingerprint reader is awesome. Camera is decent, macro camera should be improved, but overall camera is good.Battery is sufficient given that this phone has 30w warp charger so battery is not a issue.Overall this phone is pretty good at a pretty great price.

"
"

  Beast phone in terms of look, design, and oxygen os experience. But battery shoud be more when compared to other competitors in market. Headphone jack should not be removed. Otherwise a good package. This small changes need to be done in oneplus phone, that will be make the phone more Powerful in its segment.

"
"

  Camera quality at this price is really disappoing , there is a lag between shttur speed and image processing. Recommended NOT TO BUY if you are looking for good camera. God knows how they rollout product in market without basic camera testing . NOT HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE , ITS BETTER TO GO FOR SOME OTHER BRAND.

"
"

  The phone works very wellCamera quality is amazingThe battery life is good till nowThe specs are great and the price point makes this a very attractive purchase

"
"

  Having used the 12GB 256 GB variant for close to 2 months, I can clearly say that it meets the expectations just right. No lag, extremely well optimized OS, smooth 90Hz display is a real treat. Multi tasking is pretty fluid. Warp charging is great. Full charges in close to 1hour and 15 minutes. In-hand feel is great. Doesnt give that plastic frame feel ever. And its 5g ready, whenever that is ready. Extremely happy with this purchase

"
"

  After 1 month uses I am giving completed review. Performance is very good. Battery life also good but in standby mode battery consumption is high. Camera quality is very good but selfie camera is not as per the expectations of 32 MP. Charging is very fast, in 50 minutes full charge.Volume is loud and clear. Call connectivity is also nice.Overall phone is very nice.

"
"

  Super mobile exclantBut call recording feature is to bad when we are starting to record the others person in call can lesan the voice of system (now your call is recordedü§Ø and when we are offing call recordingü§Ø now your call recording has stopped) like that it is tellingBetter to fix this issue in next update.Expect record the oneplus nord is super i will giveüòâ 5 stars (expect call recordingüòë)

"
"

  Got it one day prior to the sale starts, which was quite unexpected. Great Job Team #Nord and #amazon üíôReally such beautiful features in this price.""Never Settle"" ü§ü

"
"

  This one is as my expectations, color is beautiful,camera is fine, battery performance is well, I bought this one regarding RAM.Can go with it without ant hesitation in this budget.

"
"

  Was waiting to use this mobile...but highly disappointed with one plus... Such a pathetic battery life..the new OS update has ruined all one plus mobiles...many of my friends/family have faced the issue with battery drain with all one plus mobiles...battery drains when mobile is in idle state...And nord front camera pics are not as clear as one plus 7.it simply  beautifies the pics..One plus has disappointed it's users..

"
"

  Battery is worst and I had complaint about three times they try to wash my brain they sent technician but one time techinican report problem resolved without checking my phone and second time no technician visit my address and report as they had check my phone and there is no problem this is the worst thing I m facing right now battery life is only 5-6 hours drains too fast and now they are making excuses but do not replace my pHone

"
"

  Mid-range phoneReally nice for pubg lover very smooth runningAll we knows good points here I share some problem I faced1. After call to someone 1+ gives call recording option when we click on that it will get sound 'this call is now been recorded ' this sound also here from both side so there is no option to off that sound2. Night camera images quality not goodOther than that this phone is amazing

"
"

  We can't use ear phones, we have to use wireless headsets only other things are ok wait less it's a Value for money ( but one thing is phones are automatically factory resetting  this v bad) this happened to me after one month when it was in my pocket

"
"

  It's a good phone. The process is SD 730G lags a little. Battery-life is average. There is a bit of overheating issue too. The primary camera quality is good but I am not satisfied with the front camera quality. Hopefully they will fix it up with updates. The build quality feels premium, charges very fast and over-all a very good experience. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to buy it. Worth the money !!

"
"

  The camera is really good after all the updates.the battery drained faster as compared but the fast charging covers it up pretty well.It's a very good for this price .I enjoy using itI love the slider ,it's convenient and easy.It's really a user friendly phone

"
"

  Decent phone and slightly heavier. Specs can be Better.Camera Dept: only highlight is 48mp shooter. 8mp is ok kind of. Rest of two cameras with 2mp is waste. Instead they should have configured 48+8+5 or 48+8+8.  That would have been better.Charging is decent, a typical usage will get easily for about a 1 to 1.5 days.  if you are a Gamer then depends on lots of other parameters.  Overall decent battery life.

"
"

  Basic element of one smart phone is bluetooth and  it is becoming more essential when device is not having audio jack to connect head phone.From Day one, device is having bluetooth connectivity issue over call in all social media apps specifically in whatsapp, Imo and duo.I have posted same issue and review in one plus forum but still issue is not getting resolved yet.

"
"

  As usual Quality phone from OnePlus. Camera quality is superb, warp charging takes 1 hour to fully charge but battery drains bit faster than usual.C-type to 3.5mm Jack adapter is not provided in box accessories.

"
"

  I bought this phone so that I can escape the mi use ad throw phones..but Nord didn't last for a week! Keeps crashing out of no reason!...one of the most terrible phone that I've ever acquired!I would be giving a one star if I wasn't the most generous man in the world!!

"
"

  Ok so like others I was expecting a lot from one plus nord but I was disappointed. First the front camera I don't know what to say about it even a 14k phone can beat it in my opinion. Rear camera is good.i had one problem don't know if others faced the same or not when I use opera browser while browsing sometime the screen freez for some seconds don't know if it's the app problem or what. Rest is good i think.

"
"

  I have faced call recording issue...I want update to fix this issue...battery is also ok...not that much expecting...charging speed is better in just one hour fully charged from 0-100 ,and over all user experience is good...but in 28k I expected very much ....but I fell like it is under 20k..but I am happy with OnePlus Oxygen OS..

"
"

  Delivered Defective phone, it was not charging at all. Seems to be issue with Battery and also with Speaker. Very disappointed with Product. Raised the concern to Amazon support and they said technician will visit to check the issue but it him 4 days to visit. After so much of push they are now returning the product although i wanted to get the replacement.

"
"

  Display - Very Good (Best thing in phone)Camera - Good (wide range and nightscape is very good)Processor - Very Good (haven't tried gaming)Battery - Good (Charger is very good)Looks - Very Good (its Plastic body feels and looks like glass)System - Very Good (has good features for ease of use)Overall it's VERY GOOD phone with this price for OnePlus and 5G ready phone.

"
"

  Very very unexpected device from oneplus, its very delicate.pubg is not supporting, so bad news for pubg lovers .Too many software updation issues.Even the simplest thing google is also not working properly.Even customer executives have not solution.They can only do a software update, but that is meaningless & not usefull to solve the problemsMy review is 1 out of 5.

"
"

  I will prefer this device for medium usage users and it proves that OnePlus statement ""fast n smooth"" experience.Oneplus users love this device to use it as it is superfast as compared to flagship devices of the same brand.1. Camera 10/92. battery 10/93. Display 10/94. Front camera 10/10 loved it.5. Fingerprint scanner 10/106. Performance 10/10Thank amazon for super fast delivery.

"
"

  Guys this device has some serious HEATING ISSUE .Without doing anything , just for normal use sometimes temperature goes upto more than 44 degree .We even can't hold for no longer than 5 minContacted service centre but no reply since 15 days . Just they keep telling me to do basic troubleshooting like reset and all.DO NOT GO FOR THIS .IT LOOKS LIKE THEY MANUFACTURED IN HURRY DUE TO THE HYPE CRETED.

"
"

  Camera is good but low light photo some blure, and once I have captured photo 2/3 minutes wait other wise photos blure, bettry Awesome, more improvement in fingerprint like finger is some oliy and finger print not working, others wise good performance.

"
"

  I satisfied with the one plus Nord. The problem I can say the bettry life is not that great but needs to charge twice or thrice of day if you are using contineosly..but it will give satisfaction as it supports fast charging.Camera quality is average ..but for the price it is good.

"
"

  ¬†I regret buying this phone.Pathetic touch screen and the screen lagging within the first 2 days was highly unprecedented. Even a phone worth 6K won't hang within first 2 days.Pissed of at Amazon too as they didn't allow the return. Amazon deliberately scheduled a late visit by their expert technician so that the product return time is lapsed.

"
"

  Straight away pros & consPros : Good Display,  mobile function quick & fast, finger print scanner are also good, Oxygen Os at best & face scanner is too good.network band also good compare samsung mobile.One thing  i will let u know that mobile  has been drop from my hand at around 5 feet but no damageCons : camera quality not upto mark, battery capacity to bigger & price too high

"
"

  The phone started acting funny after 20ish days.. the network keeps dropping as soon as I pick a call or make a call! I cant take any calls in the first go! I always need to call back and only then the call goes through!Google maps doesnt work right on the oneplus and I'm having a really difficult time using Oneplus for basic functionality! Definitely a downgrade for me moving from apple to oneplus

"
"

  ¬†Don't expect great things from the camera. It's grainy. I hoped for better sharpness.

"
"

  Very Nice PhoneCheapest and Best all features are smoothly work

"
"

  Been using it for 2 weeks now.... The battery is good and lasts for a day with moderate usage. There is no display tint issue as said by many users. The camera quality is however a bit low compared to other flagship models.. the colour saturation in camera is low comparatively with my OnePlus 7. But overall it's worth the money. Certain features could improve with updates like camera.

"
"

  Good, but not like flagship OnePlus , flagship OnePlus gesture like yuga animation and speak caller ID are not in OnePlus nord , otherwise mobile is good enough close to OnePlus flagship mobile. I was use this for 2 months now everything is good running condition.

"
"

  I have use it for almost 25 days. So after using is normally and rigrously my review is:Pros-Good screen qualitySound is loudSmooth to play games such as pubg, CODHuge RAMno lagging when multitaskingCons-Battery drains very fast in normal use also. I was hoping better battery performanceSlight heating up while chargingSlow fingerprint sensor than OnePlus 7T

"
"

  Using this phone for last 15 days:Pros:1. Easy to use2. Super fast3. Looks4. Camera is good surprisingly, which was not expectedCons:1. The battery of phone is worst, only annoying things about this phone is it's charging and it's quite bad. Better u have a charger with you always and a battery bank.Yes, fast charging helps but man the charging drains like flash.

"
"

  As this mobile is in medium budget range, the features are good and worth for the money.These are the drawbacks which I have observed after using this mobile for 15 days- Plastic coating- No Dolby sound support- No 3.5 mm audio jack- Front 8 MP camera not good under low light- Not Water resistant

"
"

  ¬†Value for money smart phoneüì± , with the oneplus trust and brand name , i can easily buy realme x3 or redme k20 pro , but brand name does matter a lot , oneplus 7t is also a good phone to consider nearby this price but latest things are always good over old one even if they are quit more goodüî• .

  this is my 2nd oneplus device after using oneplus 3t. I have seen many negative reviews abt nord. So on 1st sale, one of my best frnd bought 12gb variant. So after seeing his pretty good satisfied experience, i decided to go for 12gb nord. I bought it on 30th Aug. I'm still highly satisfied.. display is superb in terms of smoothness. For me, cam is quite good and take colorful pics. Aslo getting very good battery baclup.

"
"

  i used OnePlus nord(12+256) for more than  a week and based on that i can conclude that...advantage1. display quality is very good also 90hz refresh ratio added plus point2. speakers are very good and Clear3. performance is also good.disadvantage1. 3.5 earphone jacküòê is not available so you need to either go for Bluetooth one or c type2. camera is little bit artificial in color.

"
"

  Everything is perfect , except battery life. It drains little, without using the mobile much.

"
"

  After using it for 6 days.Pros:1) Great battery life.2) Oxygen OS3) Warp charging is super.4) Great for moderate usage.5) Good camera.6) 5G ready.7) Fingerprint reader and face unlock is superfast.Cons:1) Protect the screen using screen guard/tempered glass asap.2) Camera was not my priority.(that's why listed good camera in Pros)

"
"

  Highly recommended to all who are all wish to buy under 30k. Clean UI, Amazing performance, Nice camera, Good battery backup with lightning charging speed and good audio quality.I tested multiple times, there is no tint issue at all. No heating issue. Worth for each and every penny. Just go for it.My first 1+ device after Moto x, IPhone 5s and Galaxy s7 edge.

"
"

  No complaints at all from this device...Battery lasts longer than I expected.Camera is good to even in low light condition.90 Hertz display makes it even more smoother.UI is better than any other Chinese brands phone.Sound quality is bit above than average.30 Watt wrap charging is good too.Overall, this phone has everything pretty much u could expect at this price range :)

"
"

  My first OnePlus, maybe I expected a lot. But as per the price, this is what we get, right?IDK but battery doesn't stay longer it drops compared to other OnePlus, as my friend has OnePlus 6. His battery is much better, but it's 3000mah and Nord is some 4110 mAh. Thou it should stay longer than 6. It drops. As for me it's too soon to say as it's been a day since I got it. So let's hope for good.

"
"

  I have pre-ordered the one plus Nord.Camera is Quality Good.face unlock and In-display fingerprint is good.90Hz display quality smoother scrolling experience.Problem with the volume up key. When phone is on Ring mode automatically changing to vibrate mode. I have totally disappointed with the phone

"
"

  Product delivered 4-sept,but it's not up to the mark,we r using another mobile other branded one with same configurations.that one is so much better than nord.request every one to not go with this.price and quality not in sync.worth for only 20k-22k.better go with other branded in the range.i really dissatisfied with this nord.video clarity not good and selfy is looks like normal.

"
"

  Not gonna talk about good things as they r good already, not so good things below- Battery backup not so good. Changed to 2 stars.. bad bad battery..- camera quality not top notch in this price range..

"
"

  I'm very disappointed with the camera quality, photos are blurry when we zoom in, maybe because of beautification. But, the overall phone is very fast, there are no other issues than a camera, but usually, people buy a phone for a better camera so I personally very disappointed with photo quality.

"
"

  Not sure about other buyers some say their unit does not have any green tint issues with display and some say yes their unit does have tint display issue. Am one of buyer having green tint display issue. Though oneplus claims that it's a property of amoled displays then how all the units aren't facing the same issue. This is a manufacturing defect

"
"

  It's only good for taking photos and coming to other matter1. Battery life was worst, it consumes huge power if you turn on the mobile data continuously.2. Also while I'm playing pubg game most of the Times I faced am issue regarding the network connection.

"
"

  Delivered to dat morning. I bought 12GB version.Best phone in best price.Overall performance is good.Go for it if your budget allows.

"

  I bought this phone last month  now the mic üé§ is not working  and we are unable to contact the customer care and service center for this provider..I bought this for my friend to present but its working kindly help me to come out of it or replace with new mobile. Thanks ..you can contact my friend ofr this problem 8667683935

"
"

  If you're buying this device keep in mind that it has some network related issues.I had no complaints regarding performance and usage for day to day and even gaming.The only major problem is slow internet speed in OnePlus Nord even though I switched sim card with other phones they were working just fine but not Nord...So my urge is not to buy this phone until OnePlus fix this issue..

"
"

  This a very good phone..... It's battery life is good after update ...... And every one knows the oxygen os it's optimization is too good with 765G chip ... It gives very good performance.... About it's camera  it's macro and depth sensors are waste but it's main camera is good and its front camera are really good ...... Overall device is a good product from one plus but slightly costly it's upper midrange phone

"
"

  Not a good choice  ..Not expected from oneplusNo one came to pick up and to replace and not even for service etcJust wasted my time and money this timedon't say return window is closedJustice is due with amazone

"
"

  i have been using one plus nord from 3 month now and the performance is excellent.. i got 12gb 256 storage.. till date i haven't face any problem regarding speed ,heating issue, hang .. camera has great stability .. in lockdown i m using my phone all day so my battery runs out easily... i think they can do more in battery otherwise its a pretty good purchase

"
"

  A standard out put from 1+ which is worth to spend 30k for 12/256gb. I ve enjoyed the features which is realistic as they promoted.  Most of the existing manufacturer are showing their features only in papers where 1+ justifying their best.

"
"

  Pros:Good displayUser experience is always promised for OP users90Hz is amazingBattery life is goodNo display tint issuesHandy and Easy to holdCons:Average SpeakersAverage cameras at low light

"
"

  I am little disappointed on battery drainage on standby mode but leave this phone performance is best in my view. I also like it back camera clearity and fast changing mode.I experienced good gaming performance, game like pubg, cod, etcLeave battery drainage problem I had not fased any issues till now.Nice phone in this mid range price but charge high price for 5g support in my point of view.

"
"

  Battery life is very poor even on one charging it can not sustain upto whole day. Camera quality is good but instant capturing of any motion image is very poor and having blurr picture.Touchpad is good but some time required 2-3 click as it is new phoneAmazon provide support for 10days after that you have to contact to one plus support team which does not pick phone. As per price it is costly deal.

"
"

  The best device available in this price rangeGaming is good.I played pubg at high graphics with screen recorder on and it was very smooth experience.Camera is also good.Main thing is the oxygen os.it gives the best experience in this range

"
"

  I'm facing a strange network error in my OnePlus Nord. Most of the time it can't connect to internet from Google app, Google widget and Google assistant on mobile data. On wifi works fine and other apps in background can use internet at the same time.

"
"

  Got the 8gb ram 128 gb rom variant.Gray onyx back looks classy. The packaging is excellent.Great performance, decent battery life, decent for gaming.Thank you amazon for the fast delivery. Got the phone within 4 hrs after ordering.

"
"

  0 starZerooooooNo option for automatic call recordWe can record call manually...we have to record each n every call by pressing record button..but there is voice which says *your call has been recorded"" which can be heard by the receiver alsoPlease come up with some update to resolve this.Without automatic recording...the price value of NORD is 0

"
"

  The battery dries up very very fast. In idle condition when not using the phone and no ternet still it dries up very fast. Believe me, I never faced any issue with my previous phone Oppo F9pro like these. With this phone, if m watching/ chatting the battery dries up like a water. Rectify this or change the handset. I have changed my frequency to 60 ,still no effect.  I have attached few pics for your perusal.

"
"

  This is one of the best mid-range phones didn't expect anything less from oneplus.

"
"

  Its awesome. I was very worried what i might receive after reading lot of reviews. I have watched every possible YouTube reviewers video. There is no issue with the mobile. One plus experience is a bliss. You will never regret. Go for it .

"
"

  1. There Is a problem with the bluetooth connectivity.Especially when you are listening to audio. The quality of connection is poor. Though I have mentioned my issue in the OnePlus forum there is no response.... disappointing because there isa no audio jack and we are dependent on bluetooth.2. Delivery by Amazon is good.

  ¬†I don't have words for this mobile. This is the King of all under 100k mobiles.30k purchase and features chappar faad.üòçüòçBattery should be 5000MaH and mobile should be water resistance atleast.Finger print reader is ok.Battery life is goodCamera is quite good.

  Not satisfied. Micro cam not so good..Slo-mo vidoe has flickering in low lights.......after using 15 days sim slot 1 stopped working, so sent it to service center for repair they did. After receiving 2 days later same issue again occurred. Phone also not good and after seal support also not goodüòîüòîüòî

"
"

  Quality has been Compromised to make it cheaper and it reflects after use within a week. Bluetooth connectivity is hanging, battery drains fast comparative to other smart phone even on 60 Hz display, network comes and goes where there is full network coverage. More to come, as this is my review after one week use.

"
"

  I am using nord for a week and i am fully dissatified with the product ....worst touch feel ...average battery. I havent felt a smooth feel while using nord.Its very hard to move my hands while playing games....overall its worst to buy for 28k bucks

"
"

  Worst experience with an android phone, the most basic feature like automatic call recording is not available. Also when you start a call recording there is a voice notification at both the ends mentioning the 'call recording has started'

"
"

  As you know one plus is a leading brand and it's quality specifies it awesome smartphone but battery backup is nothing, packaging was not good so it's disappointed me in reality battery backup is good but my handset was a defective peace so I replaced it.

  A great overall productGreat processor fast experienceGreat fast chargingSmooth Android experienceGaming experience is great overall (I played cod pubg etc)Few consBattery drains fast(might be bcoz of 90Hz)Cameras are good but 8/10(could have done better)Conclusion: Good product 8.5/10 if you are not disturbed by the cons

"
"

  Pros :1.Face unlock and fingerprint unlock is fast2.OS performance is goodCons:1.Pink colour tint issue in bottom side of display2.Heating issues3.Camera quality not upto the mark4.Battery life not goodOverall not worth for this price range. Luckily Amazon accept my return request so I am Returning this product

"
"

  Everthing seems to be perfect with the phone. The only concern is if you keep 90hz refresh rate and play games with high visual settings, the battery seems to drain pretty quick. And since it does not have 3.5mm jack, using bluetooth headset aslo drastically reduces battery. If connected with type c to 3.5mm connector, it provides excellent battery life

"
"

  Fingerprint scanner is not that good but an average scanning capacity as it uses a light production on your fingers for scanning.Battery life is not so good but it's good and charging as you know 30W charging is damn fast.Rear camera is very impressive but front camera is not satisfactory.And oxygen OS as you know is too good with amoled screen with 90hz screen refresh rate.

"
"

  Battery back up is approximately 13-16hrs...maximum.Camera is ok not something great not something bad.User interface is best..also 30k model is worth the money.Gaming wise works fine..neither tooo good or bad.Selfie camera is good.But in dark picture calrity is less.Overall a very satisfying phone within budget of 30k.Don't go for lesser storage 64GB. Not worth.

"
"

  Pros:Best android skin Oxygen os (strength)More than sufficient power.Good battery lifeOnePlus servicesGood camara but not best in this price rangeExcellent display 90hzBuild quality üî• light weightCons:Not charging as fast as they said butCharging take one hour still good.No headphone jackNo memory Card slot

  Something wrong with this nord ...before models i used but this is not working properly as before models of oneplus

"
"

  Overall phone is good but not satisfied with it's UI and high price with this package,Big issue of not available of call recording inbuilt feature.its made sad to meüò≠üò≠

"
"

  You may get another brand phone under this price..but I repeat with this killer performance , absolute display clarity with flow glossy appearance,and camera quality no other OnePlus device comes under 30k...I have been using nord since a month,new upadtes are getting perfectly and with that upadtes performance also get improved..overall a great brand piece under this budget is awesom

"
"

  ¬†12GB + 256 GB Blue variant :1. Lag in updating the photo,which was opened from gallery option in camera.2. Too much beautification in photos those are taken using front camera( I think girls no need to do makeup for taking photos because this phone did it).3. Its better not to talk about Battery performance because its too worst.

"
"

  ¬†Camera quality is not up to the level. However, the main camera is simply wow but the other cameras need further updates. Slow motion video recording is not stable at all, the background light blinks too much! Video uploaded!! Wanted to upgrade it to OnePlus 7t but neither Amazon nor the seller could provide that facility.

"
"

  Peaks performance

"
"

  Amazing phone for the priceBut improvements could have been made with the macro camara which is is the worst in the phone.For,the 256GB varient the storage is enough without any expandable slots.Afterall it's one plus.........üñ§

"
"

  My OnePlus 6 still feels & performs way better than this Nord. Not worth the price, Disappointed! Try to get a 7T, 8 or 8 Pro by stretching your budget instead. By the time our networks are 5G ready, there will be way better options available than this one.

"
"

  after using samsung a50 mobile. I shifted to one plus nord mobile I ordered the mobile on July 28 th mobile was delivered on 5th July. after one month using the mobile i giving this review about the mobile. mobile is very good  decent colour camera quality battery backup is very good no finger print issues iam recommend to every one Whoever wants to buy this phone should definitely buy it

"
"

  Phone is good, previously also I used 3T, I'm satisfied,But the issue what I'm facing is during intermittent calls incoming/outgoing calls the other side person is not able to hear my voice, and it's not definately due to network don't rule out that I'm posting it after one month use and I have purchased 2 phones one is 12 GB and other is 8 GB and we're having same kind of issue on both phones.

"
"

  The way Oneplus Nord was promoted was having all issues resolved from One plus 1 to one plus 8 and camera qualities. But actually scenario is differentPros:Edgy/sharp look and catchy colorhandyRAM and storage capacitySound qualityCons:Front camera is too grainy. After having two camera's also in front, clicked image quality would have been better.

"
"

  Don't buy this phone . If u r thinking for the oneplus' quality ,then u r wrong . Oneplus' quality  isn't provided in camera .Otherwise for gaming it is good but the camera is the most disappointing thing in the phone . Rear camera is good but the front camera is  really bad . And I don't know why i am not satisfied with the network speed . In my  old 4g phone it is much better than this phone.

"
"

  The device delivered me on Monday being a new phone with brand like a one plus Nord still I am facing some issue like battery low performance and heating problem and hanging issue with this device I request you to please refund my amount as soon as possible

"
"

  I had a 1+ 6 before. I think that was better. If I had a choice to exchange this, I would do it and buy a 1+7t or a 1+8. It's heavy. No doubt the price is attractive. My phone hung 4 times while on a call. The screen quality is poor. U have to be on very high brightness to get the best colors. Battery Life is poor. They need to update a lotof software glitches. I hope they do soon.

"
"

  Phone build is great. Blue color is just üî•. Everything is great. Charging is super fast. Only thing that I‚Äôd point out which is worst part of this phone is it‚Äôs camera. For a 30k smartphone the camera is super dud. Worse than 17-20k phones!!!

"
"

  Battery drains out almost 25% for an hour battery very bad camera when compared Realme is bad Only brand name One plusI will check till tomorrow then decide

"
"

  After a long wait got oneplus nord. Quite difficult to use from normal android to stock android. Some features are missing like radio , dial pad prediction, camera clarity is awesome in normal and nature condition. Bt in room light its quite dull. Overall a compact phone for buyers.. If u have skyhigh expectation this is not the phone. Budget oneplus proves again as budget one...

"
"

  The camera is definitely not upto the mark. I am a OnePlus user from the past 6 years, but OnePlus Nord is a complete disappointment on the basis of a camera, knowing the cameras of OnePlus are too good. Plus, the battery life is not good as expected. I don't play any games on my phone, and yet the battery doesn't last long. I would definitely not recommend this phone for anyone.

"
"

  Good battery life. display is good.But Poor camera quality. For name sake 4 cameras are there. But 48MP has poor quality compared to it's 16MP. 48MP absolutely for marketing stunt.But for below 30k with 5g and SD u can go for it.

"
"

  At this price point, this is an absolute steal. Be it Cameras. Software, Battery, etc. every features scores high marks. I don't use this phone for gaming. I didn't install any game ranging from small to a heavy game. For general usage, this phone promises a power packed performance.

"
"

  One Plus Nord is probably the best smartphone you can buy in this price range. I switched from iOS ecosystem and I don't miss my iPhone even a bit. The phone is blazing fast and the camera is phenomenal. 5 stars

"
"

  Every thing is good but camera is not good as I expected. This camera performance is like k 20 pro.If I don't play games max 6 hours battery life I get from the mobile. Display is too bad in the mobile. I can see pink and green colour in the display.

"
"

  One plus mobiles are good but Nord didnt meet the expectation.ProsGood cameraBattery backup is goodConsNo audio jackNo sd card slotCall recording feature is not good. If you record some one call that will be notified to others by system generated message. If security is concerned if some other person record our call it should inform us

"
"

  Overall good package...battery 7-8 hours screen on time with 90 hz.. without gaming...phone feels snappy...camera gets the job done...chosen this at over samsung m 51 at 24k..pixel 4a at 29k.. Although was not launched at that time.. screen tint issue... won't give any problem unless looking for it.. you will not regret if u go for it...almost a complete package at this price of 26750/-..4.4 üåü

"
"

  It's everything you could ask for. It's a good daily driver. One plus is known for top service and updates and it's true. They are giving updates for camera and  software which makes the phone a mid range flagship phone.

"
"

  Worst product battery life is worst camera also not good

"
"

  DISPLAY issue. Disappointed .. Returning..Had purchased it for my mom.. it was birthday gift. Noticed a black spot on the screen.Have to wait for next sale.The hype created by OnePlus as well as Amazon might have worked with good sale, being a premium customer I would just rate you guys 1.Don't just end up with SORRY.. look for an alternative.Thank you!

"
"

  Very very very nice mobile thanks to amazon and one plus nord

"
"

  I bought this device first before one month but i got some problem in that device. Problem was that call was disconnecting automatically so i just replaced that one then i got new one again i am facing this kind of problem why i don't understand. Is it genuine or only i am facing it this problme. I unable to understand what i have to do. I have to keep this device to my self or back to amzone.

"

  very very worst phone & i never seen before.too costperformance very baddisplay clarity averageNo auto call recordingearspeaker clarity badtotally disappointedplease don't buy.

  Hii ordered on 6th aug and I was happy when it delivered on 7th aug deliverey is so fast and goodI use one plus Nord 3 days it's totally fineI was happy that I buy one Plus nordBut in free fire OnePlus nord ping was veri high in mobile data but on wife it's gooodThat one problem I faceI hope OnePlus get and solve this problemOverall this phone is amazing üòç

"
"

  I have bought one plus nord 8th october and gifted my wife after she start the mobile one week after recieving, the phone is 256 gb memory and 12 gb ram. It freezes all the time and randomly restarting many times a day means 4 to 5 times in an hour cannot use anything in phone os version is 10.5.8.I regret my decision buying nord. Anybody has idea when it will resolve.

"
"

  -Indoor Camera performance Not at all goodimages looks blurry worst than redmi note 8 pro-Display also looking more yellow i don't know is this only with me or some else also having-Display looks more oily (yellow shading)-Without using any thing battery drains 20 to 30 % over night- Screen doesn't look softer its look like more colour are there

"
"

  oxygenos is beast... What it is known forCamera performance not best but it's goodOther  specs are good in this budget if u r looking for complete package then this is  the one u should consider.. Speaker quite loud and clear .. firing speaker.. u will not miss  Dolby Atmos feature...Battery in 90hz refresh rate less backup but in 60 hz it stand for 1 day with atmost usage..

"
"

  Phone covering all the bases but not to top notch1. Average battery life2. Good camera but still needs improvement3. Display is good4. Speaker loud enough5. Connectivity issues here and there

"
"

  Pro Mode in Camera is quite good.Average 6 hours battery life.Excellent 5GHz wifi reception. (Very rare in buget phones)90 Hz display is awesome.Macro and depth camera is waste of money.Front camera videos are not that sharp in artificial lighting. ( 9W LED in room )Pink tint issue when using at night (acceptable, only when you are using in dark mode)

"
"

  Been using this phone for a week now. Pretty premium and lag free experience. The main camera is the real deal and does everything. Other cameras on the rear are pretty much useless. The front cam is decent. The oxygen os is running smooth and the display is great. One downside is the battery. I have to charge the phone multiple times a day. Maybe an update could fix this.

"
"

  Got this legend delivered to me today on Occasion of Teacher's day. Wanted to gift my dad for his birthday this month. Advance bday gifts are most welcome. He loved the phone. Initial set up is in progress. Finally delighted to be part of red cable club family.

"
"

  It doesn't have a good screen on time.Yesterday it had a Sot of 4 hrs..Plz help me any way possible..If there's a solution,tell me as soon as possible

"
"

  Bought this mobile from Amazon and since starting this device is causing call trouble. 90% of the calls gets disconnected after 1-2 minutes and SIM shows switched off status to the caller. Poor Mobile from a reputed brand . Don't buy this faulty product.

"
"

  Not up to the mark

"
"

  I got my nord on August 26th since it was a August manufactured unit. I don't see any pink or green tinting issue when brightness is lowered and the phone comes with oxygen OS 10.5.3 out of the box and after updating it to 10.5.5 the screen on time of the phone has drastically improved. According to my preliminary usage  i can say that the Nord is definitely a top phone to consider under 30k.

"
"

  I m fully satisfied with this product üëåüòâI have purchased both color1- for my friend (gray Onyx)2- for myself (Blue Marble)Lookwise both r very prettyPerformance of mobile is too goodRam 12 GB and internal storage 256 GB , Oxygen OS , 90 Hz refresh rate of screen makes the phone quite fine selection of buyerOverall Value for money üëåüëå product

"
"

  OnePlus nord is not a flagship phone but it is not lesser then those flagship phones, its camera quality is awsome and battery is very good, fingerprint scanner works fantastically. Graphics are good while playing heavy games, which is due the its processor and OnePlus Oxygen OS. I strongly recommend this phone. This is the one that we want in our pocket.

"
"

  One plus nord not reached expectations...it camera quality not good.And battery can't sustain for a day also...And sim support also not good...But look is good ..But this much worth for this mobile not good...They have to improve more..

"
"

  Not up to the mark of expectation, battery life too pathetic, second sim frequently out of service and need to restart. Most commonly amazon gives one month return policy, in this case only 7 days, at least will take 15 days to get an idea on new launch. Wasted money of 30000.00

"
"

  Not upto expectation.. Camera is not upto mark.. Expected more rather.. Google maps doesn't work properly and so it chrome at times.. Cal recording facility is not like in earlier models.. It's disappointing actually.. Rest other things are good.. And value for money!!

"
"

  The screen is snappy. No bloatware. Customizable, without 3rd party apps. Rear camera is average - photos are not lifelike. Some bugs are there - but I am assuming they'd be resolved with updates. Charges quicky. Build quality is good too.

"
"

  Battery life is very very less full battery is not at all coming even 5 hours.After enabling the battery saver mode also. in battery saver showing the remaining battery life but it's not at all accurate.Very very disappointed with the battery life as well as camera .every pic the image quality is blurred.My previous mobile MI A1 far better than this one plus nord.

"
"

  One of the Best Smartphones Under 30K apart from camera everything is superb Smooth... Excellent Is with No bloatware...90HZ RR..Battery Is excellent last a Day...Superb Fast Charging Warp Charging 30V.It Needs *Camera Improvement* for sure..Photos are not Upto Mark wat has been Advertised.Cheers 4/5

"
"

  Finger print reader fast ,Battery drains fast but charging is very fast due to 30W fast charger,Good quality camera as well as video recording.No problems found so far ,12GB+256GB combination makes to buy this phone,no other brand offers in this price with 48MP üì∑.

"
"

  Writing review after using one month. This phone has heating issues if i use more than one hour continuously. Don't buy if you are a gamer. Battery lasts less than one day. Delivery is also too late and I don't like the packaging(phone cover damaged).

"
"

  My review after usage of 6 days  !!  The phone is just op(overpowerful) ! Without hesitating just go for it..... Camera is  superb. U can see my pics the difference in 12mp and 48mp .Overall superbbb no lag at alll the display is awesome.Fingerprint is rapid quick....that's it I can't say anything!! Just go for it. But a small tint issue , wish it will be vanished by next update !

"
"

  UI good, charging speed also good.Expected better cameras but both front & back cameras are disappointing as getting lots of noisy blurry images. No zoom for 48mp mode. Not for people looking for camera phone.Display is good.

"
"

  Oneplus 7 is better than oneplus NordLot's of features disappearedAuto call recording is not availableI'm very disappointed this timeüëéüëéüëé

"
"

  Speed, display, speaker, battery life is excellent. But camera quality is very poor. Nord have 6 camera set up but not perform very well. I have pixel 2 xl pixel have only one back side, one camera resolution is much batter than Nord 4 back side camera. also with selfie camera. I think company using cheap marketing tactics.

"
"

  I have been using OnePlus Nord since over a month now. Overall I am very happy with the purchase but I would be happier if the battery performance can be improved.

"
"

  I thought it a beast in mid range.. But not.. After 3 months of use I'm facing lag while rendering contacts it self.. I'm using 12gb/256 gb varient. And the search algorithm is not fast in contacts. Taking long  to respond. Games and all working fine.. Camera 3/5. Doesn't have the feel of 1+.

"
"

  I FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT.THE PROCESSOR OF DEVICE IS VERY GOOD.BUDGET PHONE FROM 1+EXTRAORDINARY CAMERA.CLASSIC LOOK.I USED TO PURCHASE 2 UNITS.

"
"

  Really good thoughThis phone master pieceCamera insane except macro oneVideo quality and photo quality is dopePerformance on daily usage is seamlessBattery stays around 30 hours in normal usageScreen is insane quality is top-endGaming performance is dope üòú

"
"

  1. I have seen hanging issue in my mobile...Mobile gets automatically restart and stuck at starting logo.. I am not expecting this, very disappointed by one plus.2.Worst camera clearity.. details are not well capture and the macro lens is very very bad.. big failure of one plus for camera... I feel very bad.. why I paid 28k for this phone??

"
"

  Really dissatisfied with this mobile""DO NOT BUY THIS MOBILE""THIRD CLASS CHINESE MOBILEAfter latest software update ring is not ringing when call come, even my mobile on ringing mode... don't getting customer support serviceCAMERA QUALITY IS WORST IN LITTLE LOW LIGHT, FLASH LIGHT IS NOT WORKING IN MANY MODES.WASTE OF MONEY

"
"

  1. Design of the phone is good.2. Camera is the area where OnePlus need to focus.Main camera is ok but rest are not up to the mark.3. Warp charge & 90Hz display is superb.Overall the handset is ok for this price.

"
"

  The camera quality is way more glnetter and a difgerent than other phones. Its OIS makes the camera mpre special. The 90hz refresh rate is like butter. But one cons about this phone is that it heats up when its charging. Some times the face unlock dont respond even if the face unlock symbol is upfront indicating. But this would be the one of the best phones you will get at this price.

"
"

  Battery Backup not as expected.According to reviews its a gaming smartphone, i bought 12gb varient of nord but battery backup was not so good as compared to oneplus other phone.mobile heat too much after just using 15% while in room without fan or AC.Comparing to other phone of oneplus low light camera quality is poor.Rest all very good except the above points.

"
"

  Overall the user experience of the phone is good. The display is impressive, 60 hz refresh rate make everything smooth... The processor is good and it's quite fast. It gives a feel of almost a flagship. Only area of concern is average quality low light photography. But I think for  a phone under 30k..it's can be ignored.Design is awesome.

"
"

  Dual sim phone with speedy operation, good camera. Good battery backup with quick charge. It takes 1 hr for battery to get fully charged.

"
"

  Indoor camera performance is just average. Not worth this price. I sold the phone ovrr olx snd bought a poco x2. If camera is your first priority,then a BIIIIG NOOOO to NORD. Poco x2 which is almost 10k lesser than the jord gives much better pictures.

"
"

  A perfect mid ranger with everything made out of oneplus  7 and 8. Better battery, 6 cameras,12 GB ram, better screen, 5G . A perfect touch of everything.

"
"

  I don't know why people are expecting so much flagship features in this price and comparing it with onplus 8 camera. Oneplus Nord is already very well performing.Camera is great.Getting 8 hours of screen on time on normal usage.Screen is extremely smoothOnly con is no 3.5mm jack.......but it's manageable..Don't think twice just go for it.....

"
"

  Faster fingerprint reader... Battery life is better, not extraordinary... Using GCam gives you more effect than stock camera... Simply a nice one...

"
"

  Camera is too good.one of the best display.Giving 7 to 8 hours backup with continuous use.No heating issue.Love the OnePlus nord.Edit after 10 days of use*found heating issue*No any other issue

"
"

  This is absolutely an excellent phone at 30k with 12gb ram and 256gb rom. The fingerprint reader is genuine as top series as 7t,battery life is enough for one day, somehow in case of camera its is elegant and extraordinary in bright light condition but in full and low light condition it is not much as acceptable as a buyer. And at last thanks for oneplus for this astonishing phone..

"
"

  A solid device for daily usage with smooth performance by oxygen os. I like the oneplus community were you can post suggestions and issues which might get the attention of the developers for improving the device. Camera is decent, obviously not up to flagship standards. All in all an impressive device with premium feel and experience and only slightly lagging wrt camera performance.

"
"

  Frame is plastic... haven't Expected....+ The YouTube reviews are too much over paid... nothing so great about oxygen OS and nord itself. The camera cut out sucks...it kills content. + I hate the way the upper part darkens while gameplay

"
"

  Pros:-Oxygen OSBrand new Snapdragon 765G SOCSame sensor as op 8Amoled screen1hr to charge fullGreat design weight distribution is greatNFCFeels premiumCons:-Battery life not that great but 30W fast charging balances itProbably it killed OP8OnePlus back to Bringing us Flagship Killers

"
"

  Bloody good product!!One plus has finally understood that the sub 30k is the sweet spot for them. People prefer Samsung and Apple for anything that's over 40-50kI bought 3T 3+ years back and it worked like a charm. Nord is same price range and definitely a best buy in Sep 2020 for 30k

"
"

  Well , it is what it is , a midsegment smartphone and it definitely has some setbacks like the 2 useless cameras on the back and the stereo speakers are not there which is kind of true for most of the smartphones in this range and it is like the norm for the midtier smartphone. Hence I would say this is one of the best overall midsegment smartphone.

"
"

  Calls not completed. Around 50% calls fail.Recipient unable to hear anything from my side. This happened for around 60% of my calls.Not receiving half of the incoming calls. Getting true caller notification saying incoming call from xyz, but call is not coming through. They had to send a text or make a WhatsApp call (which again had microphone problems)

"
"

  Awesome product.Camera quality is good especially in nightmodeQuick chargering enough the battery to full just 50 minutesIssuesSpeaker is noisyNo earphone jagBattery will easily empty while always in internetPrice will be little high to compare other productBut otherthan that its ok to use and buy forgot these are chinese products

"
"

  Everything is perfect except build quality.Alert slider is very difficult to use as it's frame  is made of plastic and giving cracking sound and paint is chipping out from frame

"
"

  Poor performance...need to rectify many issues.Auto wifi calling option no need,Hilighting & visible even after opening of missed calls,Not showing what's app messaging option at calling button when showing number.One plus Customer care not responding on whats app message

"
"

  The OnePlus nord phone is excellent and super we r satisfied with it. All customers having same problem in phone contacts.Ex: we r searching for one contact we typing last 3 or 4 digitis of that contact it was not showing contact. But it was not happen in another company phone and our one plue model another phones.so please solve the problem.

"
"

  Below are the issues I am facing after using 3months-1. Battery discharged within 7-8Hrs.2. Camera quality not that much good.3. After clicking photo still flash not closed it takes 2-5sec more to close flash.4. Night time face sensor not working.5. After clicking Bluetooth on navigation bar, Bluetooth devices not searched in popolup.

"
"

  Excellent spec, beautiful design, no major bloat ware, clean OS. Having dual SIM makes sense for a business and personal number. Having 5G makes the device future proof. No lag on phone and ticks all the boxes decent cameras and it will only get better with updates from 1+. included is a phone case and screen protector It's definitely a flagship killer. For the price it's bargain!

"
"

  It's first time when I bought a 25k+ mobile & actually it worth ,1.)Camera is amazing in both daylight & nightlight.2.)Processor is avg , as u can run pubg smoothly on 60fps but company has provide only till 40fps which is kinda disappointing.3.) Display quality is excellent & there is no tint issue as many people are saying . It's very smooth thanks to 90Hz HDR 10+ Oled display.

"
"

  This phone is best for day to day usage, battery life is good and the fast charging is not as what OnePlus claim but it is faster and cool , camera quality is good while taking outdoor shots , videos are excellent compared to photos , phone is so smooth and fast I had not faced any lag in games too, display is excellent and awesome ,speaker sound is good and loud

"
"

  Awesome displaySmooth performance.but not enough for high end gaming appsVery good user interface.oxygen os is pretty goodSelfie portrait mode,selfie videos are not good enough.normal modes are okRear camera is very good at this price rangeBattery is good enough.warp charging is very effective.If you're more into camera, I'll not recommend this

"
"

  Everything thing is good any batteryBattery nt last for a dayI have to charge twice in a day without heavy use that the negative thingsOver all phone is excellent

"
"

  This was OnePlus' chance and they blew it. They should've saved the money on marketing and spent it on better build quality and display. Cheap plastic frame that breaks under stress, and a cheap panel that has rainbow banding and tint at low brightness.

"
"

  Best phone in this price I received two days ago Phone totally look premium.I want to say this is value for money phone better than Samsung a series phones.Gray color look awesome of this phone.If I talk about the camera its good according to price.Everything is good with this phone Happy to have it. Go for it. Thanks one plus and Amazon

"
"

  It's a really good phone in this price range.It is enough for my day to day use and Warp charge is amazing.But when you get the phone for first time you will see a screen protector on screen which is worse.I request who ever is buying or planning to buy this phone just REMOVE SCREEN PROTECTOR and use it there will be no issues.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader has improved since 6t. Battery life is good. Warp charging is awesome. Camera is good but the macro lens is disappointing. Othe than that, regular pictures are pretty good.

"
"

  headphones jack is not working with this device!!

"
"

  Battery life is like okay, inscreen fingerprint is actually fast,face lock have a little bug but okay and camera quality  is good and for night photography I'll give 10 on 10 points (but sometimes it take much time to take a good shot so it need to be improve!). Overall phone is quite good with fast and with nice look (especially blue colour ).

"
"

  Writing this review after 3 days of use.1)camera 4.5/52)display 5/53)processor 5/5(I m not heavy gamer)4)battery 5/55)os 5/5Overall good deal..oxygen is smooth n cool.. premium feel in hand...Regarding camera it will fix with updates.**EditedNo tint issue observedNo battery drain isuue

"
"

  3 star for Camera quality of Nord as expected is not upto that mark, Primary camera is good but Selfie and Night Mode camera is not as decent as expected. Night Images are not at all clear.Overall Oneplus Nord has made a huge hype in the market on camera but could not meet the expectation. Highly expected if the problem can be fixed providing upgraded version on its camera.

"
"

  It's phone make smooth and fast easly lifeIn my usage camera quality is low light capture bad pic day light it's ok figure print scanner is nicely worcking battery life is good and charging is fast and am first time use oxygen os this os am really love it üíØ it's give a smooth experience and I faced some Network in free fire game I think it's solving in another update..

"
"

  Everything is good but battery backup could be more efficient.(Drained fast if you use frequently if someone use for stand by then no issue it lasts min 2 days).. Anyway i hope upcoming releases will solve these issues.

"
"

  Very bad camera quality, also lagging alot. Touch and fingerprint is also worst. Also it is plastic body and doesn't support many apps.

  Im very disappointed...the phone is good no doubt but i received a defective piece...my screen starts blinking and some black lines start to come and screen starts to flutter...the fingerprint sensor works on its own sometimes it doesn't detect my clean thumb while sometimes it detects....also the green tint aata hai jaata hai...also i am facing the problem of black crush...

"
"

  Everything is good in this phone except below two1. Camera is not up to the mark like OnePlus hype there phone in terms of camera2. Maybe they should start including audio jack in there phones

"
"

  This is my 28 days old oneplus nord which have got dust inside its primary camera. This is the superb quality of 1+ phones. So please help me that should i ask for a replacement for this 28 days old phone? I want replacement for faulty device.

"
"

  Don't expect to more from this phone, only brand name is there, camera quality average, battery ok, look ok over all not best but good in 25-28k range for brand value like one plus

"
"

  I had brought this phone with high expectations and i failed miserably. The phone has a problem with the phonebook/dialer. It keeps shuttign down. Its a strict NO if you are concidering of buying it. I tried returning the phone to Amazon, but Amazon says contact your bank as you have bought on EMI. Looks like I am struck with this phone which does not work.

"
"

  Nice Mobile in look and performance  need only to improve in battery draining very fast,4115 battery still getting low very quick,other thing is very good in mobile,Except Battery.

"
"

  I just got my one plus Nord , and I can't be more happy with my phone . Very good camera quality , volume quality is good and also very smooth to use . I can only say it's a little bit heavy phone , not light weight but other than that Worth buying.There is no other cons . It's perfect to use and as per price we got more on plate

"

  Call recording option is too badWhen we were recording call it gives sound like ( this call is recording now)  this voice sound automatically hear opposite person whom u callPlease givenew update for call recording option

  Good phone overall, had a good experience so far.Battery life isn't that great, the only plus is the quick charge.Camera quality is excellent.Worth the price. üòäQuite happy with the product.

  Hey am first time using one plus phone.According to me it's a decent phone with good features1. good battery for one day2.nice display 80%3.decent camera not much good 60%4.for gaming 75%5.Features is most of all same as oneplus 8*Need to improve camera a lot front camera is useless*battery full time charge will take 60 mins

"
"

  Any person who want to buy a 5G phone then buy this phone without anydoubt.super phone at this prize.at this prize 5G phone not available in the market. Super Phone. High Processing speed. Good camera. Battery good. good design.

"
"

  Great but expensive..Could have got other cheaper phones at half of its price..Battery backup is poor..Thanks to warp..No 3.5mm jack..So bluetooth headsets are mandatory..

"
"

  Best phone ever than i use before.. refresh rate is much high. And so smoothly work . Photo quality also good. Only 1. Little problem that show dark colour.So i hope that problem solve in update.Overall best phone and charge also so fast..From experience i say rhat in 15 minutes 40 to 50%. Charge done.

"
"

  Here the problem only display nothing I see in that mobile but struggle colour effect of display only so please be maind when some one pruche s I can request go to store only then buy that's better

"
"

  The display has weird greenish purple hue. My 3 year old phone can show grey parfectly but OnePlus nord can't do it!

"
"

  Got my blue marble 12gm ram version today. The first thing that I noticed is that the display is very laclusture. There is green tint issue. It's a total let down.Battery drainage is fast and the camera is also not great.

"
"

  Good productNo tint issuesNoo problem sEverything is goodWorking too smoothBattery backup nearly 7 to 8 hoursOn continuous usageGood ram mangementCharging speed at room temperatureIs only just 56 'minutes to reach 0 to 100%And in 30minutes it gets charge nearly 60%But still what is use of macro camera ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è

"
"

  Loved it... feels like buttery..Pros-1-very smooth experience while gaming or using phone2-oxygen os3-good battery life4-best display5-good performance6-camera is Nice7-fast fingerprint sensor8-No heating issue9- premium look and slim body and Glass back.Cons-1- decent macro camera

"
"

  The worst mobile I have ever used. I have raised a complaint regarding my mobile but there is no information from amazon. Worst display,facing many problems with this device. Display isn't working properly from my third day of purchase the display got totally damaged by itself suggestions please don't buy this mobile you can go to another with this price

"
"

  ¬†I used phone phone for 10 days then suddenly screen stared Flickr and goes off now not turning on although phone is very good camera is too good but i think this only piece is faulty i hope the replace this insted of repair bcz after spending 28k m not gonna expect repaired phone

"
"

  Finger print not opening quickly

"
"

  I loved this phone.But i am not satisfied with the battery life and i am also not satisfied with the warp charge.Front camera is good but the back camera is not like expected.The performance is good little heat when play pubg.Fingerprint reader is very fast and the face unlock too.

"
"

  Battery life is one of the most disappointing features of this product.does not even last a single day even when I don't use any heavy apps and mostly restrict the usage to emails,slack and other similar basic applications.Camera quality is not great but not bad either.Would recommend to buy other OnePlus phones. This one is not worth it at all.

"
"

  Disappointed with: Camera, Battery life, performance, uninstallable bloatwareLiked: Fingerprint sensor, Display quality, Warp chargerRecommendation: I should have rather gone for OnePlus 7T or iPhone SE 2020

"
"

  I bought one plus nord four days before and it received me yesterday. I feel happy after receiving the new one plus brand mobile phone. But I am so sad that the phone is very heating after using 10 or 15 minutes. After that When I going to return it Amazon told me that our technician check it before then we tell you yes or no for return. I am not understand what I do.

"
"

  So, battery backup is not up to the mark specially for those who play games and frequent usage of phone... Max 1 day and then down but yes charges really fast ... But won't recommend to charge again Nd again ... Camera quality can be more better ... These r main things but one plus Nord didn't put focus on these ... Anyways ... Good ...

"
"

  In love with the camera quality and the color of the phone. Works smoothly. Impressed!!Also online sale is on 22nd and I got it next day (on 23rd). Swift delivery.Little bit disappointed about battery drain very fast

"
"

  Finger print not that much faster and coming to battery life it pretty good and charging speed was also excellent then finaly the camey quality of the mobile of this mobile is above average for a mid-range one overall according to me 9/10

"
"

  I'll be more than happy to give anything under 1 star... It's been only three days since I have bought the mobile but the mobile gets stuck some times for a breif 5-10 seconds...Then when I'm trying to opt for a replacement they were saying only if the technical expert says it's not good you'll be getting a replacement...Not so great policy from Amazon...

"
"

  I love the phone.. nice one 12 gb 256 gb.. fast delivery.. totally.. awesome one

"
"

  This phone has a heating issue.With the way the publicity of this phone was done, it doesn't even meet the basic standard.Even while using chrome and Instagram, the phone gets abruptly heated, that it even becomes difficult to hold it.Its been just 2 months since I am using the phone and the company refuses to give a replacement.

"
"

  As I bought it, I saw one plus giving free  2 additional covers with the phone, unboxing video also comprised of the same, but I didn't get any. It's very disgusting either you should not portray or you should give it to the customers.

"
"

  - super build quality- premium looking phone- clean and simple OS interference- good camera, but struggle in some conditions- heating issueCompare to other phone in this price segment the price is Higher then Others compare to feature..Overall 3.5/5

"
"

  Oneplus nord....i have dreamt about it and finally got this on aug 12... Its been 1 month exactly and feeling good about the product....oneplus is giving so many updates and resolving the small issues.... Gud product in low budget....

"
"

  I was iPhone & Samsung user before but dared to take decision to shift on 1+ & my decision goes right.Excellent performance, No heat or lag, Best is Oxygen OS I became fan of it, Battery üîã is also good take you through whole day, standby time is awesome.So conclusion is shift to 1+ without doubt.

"
"

  Fingerprint Responds well.camera good as per mid range std. Overall feels good operating.And hatsoff to Amazon delivery.. suppose to deliver on 22nd Aug but got it on 16th one day before my bday...

"
"

  Pros:Qulaity display and overall built.Good battey lifeOxygen OS is fast and reliableCons:Very bad camera optimisation. Low light pictures are not sharpFront camera struggles to provide any detail in low light

"
"

  It's really Budget phone from oneplus.... Display quality satisfied but camera completely disoppointed... Not reached oneplus brand camera expectations... Body little weaker than other oneplus mobiles... Battery life Good. According to my experience it's unsatisfied product from oneplus better to choose other oneplus product by adding few money. Not worthable piece

"
"

  Excellent phone for 30k but still has lot of long road to become flagship killer hopefully with future updates.Display I have some light tint issues and black bar which is ignorable but hope ota update fixes it OnePlus is getting back now !.

"
"

  Dnt buy this phone...half of the time u will face network problem in this phone...it's taking too much time for surffing....half of the time my colleague complaint about my no not reachable...i have raised request for replacement but that executive visited and said everything is working fine we can't replace...I am very disappointed with this phone

"
"

  It's the best phone under the price bracket of 30k....... Performance wise it will never ever let u down.......cameras are also good........... battery is really good will survive 1 day easy with heavy usage....... finally great deal!!!

"
"

  Best thing I liked about the phone is its handling & light weight. Overall very happy.

"
"

  Since there was issue with my device and already going through amazon replacement process but don't when it will be replaced and there was also no ownership from one plus. Delivery was quick , device is very good but nothing over the top...its kind of regular device but packed with requirements hardware...

"
"

  I am using this phone from yesterday. Battery backup is good getting 7hrs+ sot. Camera is okay.But at 28k.  You can go for upcoming pixel 4a.

"
"

  Battery drains too fast even without playing games. Just for streaming 1 or 2 movies.If it is 90hz it only gives you 10 max but if you switch to 60hz it gives you 12hrs. Battery is not performing like they promised. Camera is good but not as good as earlier phones. Overall first impression is good except battery.

"
"

  1. Display is super2. UI wonderful3. Speed- after one week use I don't feel any speed issues4. Camera is the best, at this price range smart mobilesOver all I am too satisfied and happy with OnePlus Nord

"
"

  I think it's not that much good as one plus other device if we go on price segment it's better then other phones but if we go on the brand name it dosent sattified me because I m having 2 more one plus device from last 2 years they are much better then nord we can not say that it's a waste of money but in that price segment we can get much better

"
"

  Nice phone and my brother is very happy which is I have selected this device and wonderful phone...Now we are family 1 PLUS.. after switching from Iphone to 1plus 7 Pro.... As of now amazing journey... No battery issue and camera quality is amazing...

"
"

  Good phone. Nice speed. Decent camera. High performance.  Double tap on screen lock has a small issue.  Battery could have been longer. Also one plus could provide updates to Nord too.

"
"

  The camera is not as good as expected from one plus flagship phones. But overall one of the best phones you can get in this range. Bluetooth connectivity has some issues, hoping that it'll get rectified in a software update. Otherwise overall a good phone at this price.

"
"

  Phone is overall OK but now after many days of usage it has started slightly hanging and restarting planning to visit the servic centre soon..

"
"

  It looks more premium in person! Everything sums up so perfectly, the 90 hz display makes it feel smooth! And of course the OxygenOs is no match for any other custom UI!With full battery you can end up your day having 10-15% still left!Camera is fine, but you can download google cam, and it's just way better then!

"
"

  The phone is decent. Screen quality is great. Same is fingerprint scanner and youch. Performance is suparb. Although it has mono speaker, the sound is loud enough. Camera is also okay for most of the users. OxygenOS and frequent software updates are also making the experience better. Overall, it's a great phone in the price range.

"
"

  Brought this mobile with hige expectations,but this is the worst mobile i have evar used, Night mode is worst,after connecting to the blutooth headset  battery will get drained immediately and even charging we have to keep it for almost 4hrs for full battery, not worthy of money waste mobile I'm using this mobile from last 1 month

"
"

  If you r a heavy user and a casual gamer you can definitely consider this phone.It doesn't mean gaming is bad but actually not upto the standards of flagship performance.Battery backup is excellent.If your primary concern is camera then I won't suggest this. Those who want a good os experience also can consider this.It is the entry of oxygen os.

"
"

  Dont fall in trap. According to one plus, this phone has a new feature ""pink tint in display"" after knowing that it was a feature, I was so grateful. So no replacement should be given on the behalf of that feature..I am lucky among my friends to have this feature who bought this device..Thankyou one plus for the splendid feature you have given for some devices.

"
"

  Battery life is poor. I tried to return the order but Amazon has disguising the people by blancco app. It is showing your phone is good but there is battery checking option. On reading this message Amazon please help in this matter.Phone performance is good interms of camera, speed but lagging in battery performance. We have to carry power bank Everytime.

"
"

  I bought this mobile in pre-order sale, There are many issues with this Mobile.1- Network connectivity can be lost any moment while talking2- Heats a lot when you watch a movie or any video3- Pathetic camera quality, works okay in daylight but in night its horribleI won't suggest buying this mobile as in 28K, it doesn't worth 20K.

"
"

  Don't buy nord . Because fingerprint reader is very slow it's 2 mins to open . I face data lossing issue . Camera quality not same at OnePlus 8 it's totally different . Sometimes I face network issue also . SO DON'T BUY NORD I use 8 128gb .( Best of speed) App opening time is very fast . Battery is super more than 1 day it come. At use 90rate .

"
"

  Okay, it's a one plus device. But i don't think it justifies its hype. A decent camera perform. Battery backup is not that great even when we r using the phone on 60hz. Software is really smooth. There it gets big thumbs up from me. I really liked the display. Charging speed is really good.Overall a very good option for daily users.

"
"

  Great Phone. Value for money. Great Performance, Suppereb camera quality. And fantastic gaming experience. Love this phone..

"
"

  Please don't buy it.It's trap by oneplus and amazon.Totally waste of money.They not replace nor accept return.Samsung m31s camera battery and screen is far better than this one.Thank you.

"
"

  Everything is good except the camera..worst camera than 15,000 smart phone camera range. I was lucky to not have tinting issue which was plaguing oneplus nord screen.

"
"

  I think developer gone MAD.. For phone unlock,Hidden apps, and for App lock also we have to give same password. I don't know why he developed App lock and Hidden apps without individual passwordsüòúü§£

"
"

  Below average image quality. Selfies come with a halo around the head. Looks photopshopped. Disappointment! Do not buy if you want even a decent camera. Phones in half the price are offering better cameras as per my personal experience. Battery is alright (lasts 24 hours with moderate use and insta browsing. Doubt it will last long if you use it for gaming).

"
"

  Camera quality not good

"
"

  It's A Great Deal at This Price , Battery Life is Around 10-12 hrs after  Complete Charging ,Warmth Is Just Normal,Camera Qualiy Is Awesome ,Display And Performance Is Something Just Like Pretty Much Everything  You Could ask For

"
"

  Everything is nice,Good performancegood battery backup + fast chargingaverage sound qualityhigh speed internet connectivitycamera is average around artificial light/low light.but the worst problem of this phone is its heats a lot specially while using in sunlight or in warm areas. eg, at the time of electricity cut.

"
"

  Awesome battery life with nice camera but at some places or sometimes it clicks grainy pics.. but over all it's no less than one plus 8 or 7t.The front camera now disappoints meIt cannot control the background light well.Otherthan that cam is ver good at the backBut front is bad if there is  light or over bright place just behind you.

"
"

  So delighted by the phone but so disappointed by the Amazon delivery speeds. Night scape is good.In just 4 mins 700mb data was vanished used only whatsapp for that time, lots off data theft was happening please be aware of it

"
"

  After 1 month of usage i would review this phone a good buy.....  I previously owned one plus x and have been using for 4 years.  So one plus have not let me down except the battry is not as good as i thought...  Feels comfortable in hand,  Back Camera is v good in my opinion, front camera i was expecting more.  Overall a good option to buy

"
"

  Delivery more than 20days

"
"

  Amazing phone i am a tech type of  person first i taught of taking it or not but then i ordered it because it is a balance phone and you need it best phone under 30k for gamers this should be not a option go for x2pro but yes that phone has limitations that is for gamers only of you dont play games or play but 2-3hrs only maybe pubg then go for this nord.

"
"

  Nice product I have received this product on 8 agust when I lifted  box it's too heavy I think that it there is something else it's not mobile but when I opened it its mobile and it's the weight of charger overall performance is very good nice mobile dual punctual design gives it a more beautiful look oneplus deserve 5 star for this mobile

"
"

  Value for money.. middle level budget mobile. It‚Äôs awesome . Especially I have to mention here amazon Delivery man . He is so kind and polite and he maintained the distance with face mask . I lives in rural village area , still he‚Äôs reach  exact my location  and delivered secure and Safely my product . Thanks a lot for seller & amazon üôèüòá

"
"

  It's camera just awesome üòçüòç..It's battery performance just nice and charging is so fast...Processor is cool pubg going like pro btw ONEPLUS is always a pro mobile...  I am so happy for this mobile üòçüòçüòç.

"
"

  Everything is awesome except the tint issues in bottom of the screen, some green pink tink are seen in screen otherwise its preety awesome

"
"

  Exchanged my 4 year old 3t with 8gb/128 varientOS is not the smoothest , processor lags while multitaskingCamera is averageBuilt quality is goodOverall, I feel my old 3t was good enoughDo not feel value by upgrading

"
"

  Smooth OS - no lags at allAMOLED screen is good quality screenBest battery backupExcellent Camera front n backAwesome designBest sound quality5 out of 5 üåüPrivacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phonesAll other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviations

"
"

  Gifted to my sister.  Seems to be doing good, although I have complains about its camera. It's not clean and stable for low lights n indoor pictures.

"
"

  Very well made product. No complains. Have single speaker, but sound is very loud. Camera quality is also gud enough for this price range.

"
"

  Average.Camera is above average but takes not so good low light photos.Display is really good.Battery life gives me 7.30 hours screen on time with 60 hz and maximum 6 hours screen on time with 90 hz Display.Fingerprint reader occasionally doesn't show!!. Performance is Good.Smooth surfing.25 hz warp charging takes 1 hour for the battery to fully charge.

"
"

  Excellent phone for using as your daily driver. It's been one month I've been using it, and the experience is absolutely amazing. Oxygen OS bossing it, as usual. I was more than happy with the camera performance and battery backup. Bluetooth earphones get disconnected sometimes while calling, an issue which will most probably be fixed with more updates.

"
"

  From the date of delivery i am facing network issues..if i do not use my phone 15 to 20 min it goes to sleeping mode.after that i can not do outgoing call and if anybody calls me it sounds out of network area or switch off.Really horrible.I have to restart the phone lot of time in a day..bad phone

"
"

  I got my Oneplus nord on 10th of October and after 24 hours it blacked out while i was using it. Ive ordered for replacement but i was not expecting this to happen. It didn't even last for one day. Ive installed apps and had logged in  every account of mine. Now i have to wait for another 10 to 20 days. Im  dissatisfied to say the least.

"
"

  ¬†I am a die hard one plus fan. I was earlier in Blackberry and then Nokia and then iPhone. Last 3 years using one plus 5. Now bought this more. Beautiful phone. Good battery, good camera, good speed, good ui. What elas can you ask in I phone

"
"

  Battery backup is very poor if u use ur phone regularly then it's need to be 3 times charge in a day also front camera is very ghatia, when u take selfi in low light in room or hose then it take few time to phto otherwise photo will be shakes.. and 5000/- types phone front camera better then this. So I suggest pls go for another one

"
"

  ¬†Worst battery life.Camera overexposed.It makes all natural climate into an artificial look.Lags many times....Even the calculator app freeze very badly.....

"
"

  one plus nord nice product but its battery backup not good its 6 hours backup i am not satisfied auto call recording not provided  its version i am using 60zh but battery life only 6 hours pls team solution in. this version..

"
"

  Received 12 GB/256 marble blue variant, highly disappointed with One plus, within a week mobile stopped working.After lots of discussion,Amazaon executive aggred to replace the item however withing hour backed off from replacement and suggested for refund . reason  was stock unavailability, but the same time app shows  stock was available with seller.

"
"

  It's not turning on, it's showing display 1+ icon. That's it. . I got a defective piece. Amazon wants repair it , not to replace immideitly. Very bad service from Amazon. Don't buy it. Very bad software. , I can't talk about phn , ad I couldn't on it, it's mid way to on. It's just 1+ plus display. How can I use phone and talk about it.

"
"

  Good Screen Quality with 90hz refresh rate.Good Camera in daylight except the macro one.Good Sound Quality though a mono speaker.Good battery life.Average Low Light image quality, could be better.

"
"

  Best Phone under Budget. I was planning to buy pixel 4A but ended up buying this phone. After a few days usage I am glad that I bought this phone.Best feature of the phone :Battery BackupDisplayDimensions

"
"

  We have received my order, but at the time of placing an order there shows 3 covers with this phone. But we don‚Äôt get any cover

"
"

  The options they've provided are good but phone's quality is very bad and it started automatically reducing the volume without even touching anything initially I thought it's because of the back case I removed it and even then the same issue is repeatingPs: I was using the same back case which I've received along with the phone provided by one+

"
"

  The mobile is good quality & handy.There are 2 big problems in User Interface & this problem is only in this model -1/ When press call record, it plays a voice over that Call recording has started.2/ The call recordings are Not saved anywhere in the phone.These are big issues & same problem are not there in other models.

"
"

  Camera quality is superb clear. Fast charging. Grey look is soo classy.handy phone. Overall if everything is here in 28000 the why should we go for 50k... Just go for it

"
"

  Worst camera quality of this mobilei used other oneplus mobile but this nord is not worth...I want to return this product but amazon service was so pathetic they not give me proper support after so many complaints.

"
"

  The phone is ok battery life good but not excellent...... disappointed in width of the phone.....but camera quality excellent......if your a photographer never go.....but at this price 12 GB ram with 5G....best choice...also good for gaming there too the size is the issu.....but all around its perfect choice for your parents.....or that aged people.

"
"

  It is a good phone and gives nice os experience but the biggest turndown is it's camera quality...i expected a good camera features from one plus but it's really bad...Front camera clicks blurry pics and not give good pics in low-light...i hope one-plus will resolve the camera issues in coming updates otherwise I'll regret buying one plus nord

"
"

  Amazing phone......using it from last 10 days, it's running very smoothly. Camera is the best part of the phone....front and rear camera both take very vibrant photos. Next best thing is the fast charging. Overall very good phone. Only one drawback it lack headfone jack. But using this phone now I don't mind spending more 5k for bluetooth headphone.

"
"

  After having used it for a month...I would say that this phone was a lot more over rated by Oneplus.......The phone is ok to use....you might notice a lag your phone getting hanged for 3-5 secs and then back to normal.If you are looking for a premium smartphone under 30K...go for it...if you can increase your budget.....go for any other.

"
"

  Liked this phone. Overall performance is good. Worth for the money spent.Smooth rendering on pubg game.No display issue under low brightness.Macro camera was not enough good with focus and clarity but it has been fixed by 10.5.4 OS update. 4k videos & camera üëå. I recommend this phone to everyoneüëçüëå‚úåÔ∏è

"
"

  - Super fast and snappy device to use, thanks to the software optimisations and the high refresh rate.- Fingerprint reader is fast and works almost everytime, in different conditions- The camera quality is not that good. The white balance and the colours feel very off. Hopefully it's fixed in a future update

"
"

  the nightscape view is better than one plus 7 or 8size is perfect however a little issue with the normal camera as it is giving blurr effect if not holding for 2 sec after the click.

"
"

  Cons:Low light photography is bad. Front camera could be better. Average battery life requires tweak in setting. Plastic frame..useless last two camera,mono speaker,no ip 68,no reverse chargingPro: gorilla 5 , 5g, 90 hertz, display is good, processor snapdragon,fast charging ,smooth performance

"
"

  I think it's very big mistake yo buy one plus nord at this price range. Because of frequent heating even at low usage like fb youtube, and when you play pubg it's become molten lava, also battery drainage quickely just 4 hrs

"
"

  Pro - Great performance, feel in hand, screen qualityCon - battery life is only 4 hour screen at max in a day, camera has some stability issue cannot take fast moving photographs.At the end the phone is up to my expectations üòä loving it.

"
"

  Good buy for the OnePlus brand at this price. Please check on the memory part though as only 40-41 GB is available for usage out of the 64 GB mentioned, rest being used up by the system apps. A good choice for people who want normal storage and good camera, battery and other video/sound features. Rest, the brand speaks for itself!!!

"
"

  In an interview CEO has mentioned that if the Phone was pre-ordered and purchased before 31 August...customer would get 2 gifts, but none of that was true in my case.....100% marketing technique and he mislead....utter lie

"
"

  Phone is amazing..But the charging cable i received is damaged or bad quality..I m very dissatisfied with the charging cable quality..I want it to be replaced with a new one plz do the needful

"
"

  My experiences with oneplus nordI am using it from 20 days the phone is very convenient to use better performance but sometimes apps closes suddenly when we opened frequently even 8gb ram feels useless here andmy worry some is chrome app is not even updating how many times u try and camera is good for outdoor pics selfies n low light r avg..

"
"

  I have first phone purchase one plus. But i am soking result on of the best phone one plus brand, camera quality good , battery awesome , sound very nice , performance very good...Only one dis point camera night shot rediest scin tone without flash , with flash ok , a lot off future in one plus .I recommend this phone purchase.üòä

"
"

  Finger print reader is very poorly responding. Battery working only for one day in regular normal usage. Camera is good,but, in the high expansion it is scattering.

"
"

  This is the worst one..phone looking premium but many problems in this one plus Nord..1. network connectivity hanging 2.battery draning very fast 3. Heating issues.. yutube walo ka mat suno yaaro , just ignore karo..

"
"

"

  Not good ,battery draining very fast ,heating issue also observedI have raise the compalin for replacement but amazone arrange the person for inspection ,but inspection person share the false reportAmazone not faith CustomerVery disappointed

"
"

  Battery backup is not good...phone is not giving goog battery backup...it hardly gives 4 hours of backup with normal use .....what is the problem ...I am charging it 100% but it gives hatdly 3-4 hours of battery backup....

"
"

  Like:user experienceDislike:camera and gaming performancePlz short out the problems related camera performance and gaming performancePls solve the problems of connection loss during gaming specially in pubg

"
"

  Worst part is I got a missing worst worst

"
"

  I hve been using OnePlus 6 phone for the last couple of years. Recently changed it for Nord - VERY BAD DISCISION. my older one was far better in all parameters.

"
"

  EXCELLENT PROUDUCT

"
"

  Bought with the exchange with oppo f7 at 22k.This phone is best in all the segments considering its price

"
"

  If you are taking this phone only for gaming then, I recommend don't take this and I  don't have any issues with the phone.

"
"

  Its not something like out of this world ,but its a cute phone and feels pretty good while holding,camera is pretty good also good for videos if you are looking for a phone which can record good videos,these are some features a little tiny features which I don't like like music player but overall i am giving 5 out 4 so go for it

"
"

  I really love this device.Pros : oxygen isFaster Finger print readerNice glass finishGood battery lifeCons : camera is the wrost part of itFace id is not working probablyHope OnePlus fixes these issues soonI would love to review all the productsProducts may be anything.

"
"

  is this awesome mobile phone for normal ussage, havey task , better gaming experience, best camera class & future proof 5g phone looks feel like primium. 1 mobile everything u need in 1 handset just go for it.

"
"

  The indisplay finger print scanner works very well.The 90hz display works very smooth and fasterCamera- The main camera 48mp with ois works very well and the ultra wide angle camera is also good but the other two camera is not upto the markThe Oxygen OS is very fast with 90hz displayOverall it is a good deal to have it.

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus brand phone. No tint issue. I have hands on Samsung and Motorola earlier. No lagging, camera is okay, depth and macro is only on the cards.. Battery back up is not so good. I don't play games on my phones, for normal usage so far battery backup is around 15  hours only.Go for 12 gb and 256 variant only.

"

  - Great Experience- Smooth transition between screens- Camera Quality is OK (not great !!!), but good for budget- Battery is poor (drains in less than 24 hours at medium level usage) - with Maps etc, i think it would not last for half a day- Charging is fast - 1- 1.5 hours for full charging

"
"

  This phone is really value for money. I love everything about this phone. There's just one thing which I wasn't expecting, i.e., it's weight. Yes, this phone is heavy and not meant to be used single handedly. I tried it but since then my palm is paining. I would suggest you to buy only if this doesn't bother you. Overall phone is really good.

  If u want performance and smoothness in your smartphone then this is truly  pretty much everything u can ask forA little bit glitch with camera and one plus is already working on it with the new update quality has increased substantially and same will happen in futureFor best android experience go for one plus üëçüëçüëçüëç

  Hello I brought a one plus Nord in gray colour the performance of phone is good but the camera's are below average I didn't get setisfied with the camera performance in the low light conditionsThe frount camera will struggle if we take normal selfie the photo will capture like very soft...like we apply any filter of any beauty mode...!

"
"

  Very gud experience with this phone .. the camera quality is very nice and the night scape is very good for nature and moderate when we take pictures of people..  other wise the clarity of the camera is Crystal clear..

"
"

  As a new OnePlus user I was amazed with the mobile performance and the battery life, but quite opposite for the camera performance mainly indoor photography is way better in my old device which is Honor Play. Still need to test outdoor.

"
"

  Mobile is working fine.Checked Camera quality. Good oneDisplay refresh rate is as fast as described..Display quality is little lower. Can't feel very very good view.

"
"

  I ordered it one month back but it is giving lot of issues.It has touch screen issues,phantom touch,screen flashes automatically.Apps open automatically. It was my first oneplus expierence but lost faith in it.

"
"

  I'm using nord for last one month but there is some problem in network, whenever I search something on Google it shows connection is offline and I have to switch off and on data connection to see the results. It's very annoying.Battery life also not good as it exhausted by evening after moderate use.I think I had waste my money.

"
"

  The experience is so smooth, thanks to Oxygen OS & all the options it provides. I even got 2 updates in 5 days. The charging is really good. The screen protector is pre-applied & the box also comes with a transparent back cover.Blue color is really amazing.I just miss the headphone jack. Rest everything is top notch.

"
"

  The audio quality is very very poor. Being a music lover, the sound after I use earphone literally is very harsh. Tried changing the settings but of no use. The bass sound is very bad. Very sharp noise which is very irritating.

"
"

  very bed camera performence also battery backup

"
"

  This is my 4th Phone from one plus series.. Never disappoints..  Again classy and best phone by One Plus

"
"

  Facing network issue. Not able to return as well already return window closed after 1 week of receiving my delivery, till I experience it. First user of one plus. And totally disappointed.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

"
"

  if someone shows that they know everything about a phone , i would like to say that you guyz are may be YouTubers.No issue on this phone all good and nice product in this price range

"
"

  It kept the brand value,else the only problem you will face is with the secondry camera(front camera) which needed to be improved.

"
"

  Received the handset on 3rd September and started using from 5th september onwards. Handset is geating heated while using ,its strange for a new device. I never felt such kind of experience in any of my new devices.

"
"

  At the first hand, I updated it for better camera quality and for some improved features. I am totally amazed with it's smoothness in gaming as well as camera quality which is expected as usual after switching from my previous phone mi a3. Very good device from OnePlus at this price range with a powerful fast warp charge.üòâ

"
"

  Camera is more of a marketing gimmick

"
"

  Everything was up to expectations.They said that the camera was not up to the mark, but honestly it takes very good photos than the other midrange phones under 28k.Battery life was good.Charges in 58 mins, 1 to 100%.Gaming was good.Pretty much everything you could ask for!

"
"

  The camera is very average. No headphone jack. The placement of mono speaker.Not for gaming. What's the use of 12 mb ram if the gaming experience is pretty bad.One plus spoiling its name.

"
"

  It is good phone at this price segment. Display is super smooth thanks to super amoled 90hz display. Loved the Oxygen OS. Camera is good but the macro camera is so bad and design I could it is okay okay, not that great. Battery backup and charging is fine for me. If you don't worry much about macro photography and design. Then go for it.

"
"

  All the feature is good except  the battery that  is draining too fast.i really appreciate this phone if the battery backup issue will be fixed. I recommend that before buy u can make up u r mind about battery backup.

"
"

  Loved the Software part.Aesthetically too good.Camera is too good with lot of new options.Speed / Performance is Ultimate.Battery is just ok. Best suitable for Single network only with WiFi. Dual sim usage especially with Jio sucks.Very good value for Money.Go for it!

"
"

  No words to say!!!!! Best phone in this price. I'm satisfied . Didn't like the macro cam though could have been better. Everything else is good.Battery life is good. No tint issue. Games run smoothly. 4k/60 fps is not supported in main camera

"
"

  Overall it's a best phone I ever hade.But facing following issue1) The battery is very weak. For average use needed two time charge in a day.2)data is getting off automatically continuesly

"
"

  Everything about the phone is good if not great for the price it is being offered. But camera need some consideration and you have to try various times if you want the shot you desire or you can go for Google cam mod.

"
"

  Not impressive. I m not feel that I m using OnePlus mobile phone. There are two major issues.1:- Network connectivity2:- Bluetooth disconnected in every 5-6 secondAnd one more things when playing muy on full volume mobile is vibrating.Before NORD I have used OnePlus 7 .Software in okay but hardware cheaper.

"
"

  Not at all worth,while pre-book they promised jio bundle offer with smartphone but till date i have not recd any offer, Bluffmaster chinnee

"
"

  Disappointed! I got this on 3rd aug and so far I experienced the following issues:-Battery is draining out very fast!!!!-Front camera quality is not impressive, contrast level is low, it is brightening out the images.-Fingerprint Reader isn't smooth and doesn't detect quicklyOverall nothing special in this device

"
"

  What an Phone from Oneplus jst Loved it...Clean software experiences Rich Feeling when Used This phone,Camera In all directions its Excellent,Dnt Watch any Youtubers Recommendation Opinion cilips against oneplus nord,Best phone from oneplus 2020,Screen Color's Jst Dashing guys,BRANDED PEOPLE'S CHOICE ALWAYS IN ONEPLUS BRANDüòçü•∞ü§©

"
"

  May not have a good screen , camera, GPU , processor ,etc. But a one plus UI below 30k  is what all matters for me . NO BLOATWARE. Almost like a Google pixel

"
"

  After two days of use I am writing this review. Perimum look, decent battery, camera is good. Size and weight of phone gives good comfort in handling. Delivered before actual schedule. Dinner print rest is real fast. Decent battery.

"
"

  Best phone in price Segent of 25k to 30kGot a phone 4 days back and still looking for all the features and till now satisfied with phone features. I would recommend to purchase this phone since its handy and user friendly. The design and make of the phone is perfect. Will share all likes and dislikes after few days

"
"

  Yesterday i recieved my product when i start to use my phone after 30 min my phone produce heat when i m on call and battery back not good and main thin is one plus say never settle but current i settle with my phone

"
"

  This is my first phone from One Plus...Till date am using Samsung and iphone, but brought this for battery and 12 RAM and storage 256.. and good camera as usual I have heard fm others.But here CAMERA is below average..1 starRather go for 15-20k bracket phone from other brands.

"
"

  ¬†Nice Products,  item  ordered on 7-08-20 and products manufacturing on 06-08-20, fresh  products.Box packing very good, inside box item  found no any open products.Mobile camera awesome, screen awesome,  like stock android awesome,  overall 5out of 5.

"
"

  I didn't actually understand whether to buy or not but finally bought itI really liked the product very muchTo those who think of the issues,there are no such..I liked its performance

"
"

  Sexy looks and best in  proformance.....üëç Very nice and in hand feel is great......1 had booked it on 28th july so I got it on 4th august...even before the sale got started..loving the device.

"
"

  Processors is decent. Camera  may be improved to 64mp.battery is not sufficient for 5g device. Is this price range oneplus must be increased some additional features.overally a good device.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader sometimes takes 2 secs to read. And the battery life is pretty given i use heavily.And the camera quality is good as well just during video recording red colour sometimes changes to orange somehow which is weird but i hope in future OTA updates they address this issue.

"
"

  There is not even single one plus phone I have not bought from 1+1 to Nord.I was so satiated with this but since I have purchased Nord my faith in one plus is trembling....Worst phone I have ever used ........ nothing good about this phone I curse the day I decided to purchase this phone.

"
"

  Advertisement is great, northing is there in this mobile- Waiting for this booking is ridiculous. More over its just similar RAM Speed and Blackberry work App shows Forbidden device- Not capable device. for my purpose of purchase is not solved. Use less. Waste of Money.

"
"

  worse product from one plus, even the op1 is still better than this and this one is worst than than even the redme phone with half of the price. customer please don't buy this phone. just 2-3 thousands more you can go for op 7T. This is an outright cheating by one plus.

"
"

  Ordered blue color phone, received grey instead. Seller should have sent an email if that was okay. Blue was very unique. Grey is routine and nothing special.Phone lived up to the expectations. So good rating overall. Add expected, camera was meh.

"
"

  Received a defective product screen broken and have alot of heating issue,camera is also not upto the mark,otherwise phone is good,i returned the phone will buy if all issue resolved in future

"
"

  Cons :1. Fingerprint won't work properly if your hand are wet .  2. battery drains drastically with time.  3. Rear camera is not upto the expectation  4. you may face heating problem with this.Pros : 1. Refresh rate and display is good  2. You will regular updates from OnePlus for  oxygen os.

"
"

  This is one of the best phone ever,must buy this phone because of not this is available under 30k but for that phone's overall performance is excellent, battery life is best and that's camera superb,‚ù§Ô∏è.

"
"

  The phone is blazing fast and handles most work efficiently. However, the camera quality is questionable and lacks depth. I wouldn't recommend this as a primary device. However, it is amazing as a secondary device.

"
"

  Selfie camera is not perfect selfie is very bad others why phone is ok rear camera good but micro camera very bad and displays perfect working

"
"

  I've compared this phone's specs to it's competitors, and even though the specs are quite similar, the user experience is much better, so much that I'll actually say that it is the best in it's class. tl;dr- A Flagship turned down to 9 is what it feels like.

"
"

  Well the phone is great for daily use but couple of very major issues. Call issues, I'm experiencing evey second day. When I get call and I try to accept it and it doesn't. Screen freezes. I have to call back the person itself. Also it restarts.I'm using 12gb variant.

"
"

  Battery and Processor alone is enough to rate this mobile. Oxygen OS and screen clarity are top notch. Really in love this mobile. I am writing this review after one month usage

"
"

  Good Build Quality, Value for money

"
"

  Excellent product üòçüòçüòçJust Loved It

"
"

  @OnePlus_INSir I have purchased OnePlus Nord 12..256. by Amazon online.i am received on 6 sep and started on 7sep. After using 3 days I realised his bettery back up is very low.his bettery backup only 8 to 9 hour's . It is too problametic. No one cherge his phone üì± twice in a day. Phone is best but bettery is very very poor.

"
"

  After purchase I satisfied camera quality not High but process is to good and oxygen os extreme smooth. Charging Speed not to High but comare to one plus 7t is good . when you play pubg little bit of heating issue.because one plus nord not give liquid cooling system.camera is better samsung galaxy A51 compare to this price segment.

"
"

  Here there is a tinty blueish colour on display on Nord. I don't like it. Looking for one plus will solve this problem in its next updates.

"
"

  Guys, i am purely a OnePlus user.Believe me if you are looking for a normal use phone then it is the best choice.But if you are a gamer or looking for good camera.Don't even think once to buy it.Not at all worthy cameras.Worst camera quality by OnePlus.I am tottaly disappointed with OnePlus.

"
"

  So far so good.. used it for like last 4 hours.. tested all the settings.. lot of customization options.. pretty cool.. camera quality not the best but good.. phone is smooth.. no lag.. could improve the speaker though..

"
"

  Performance - 4.5/5Display - 4.5/5Build Quality - 5/5Camera - 3.5/5Battery - 5/5Charging - 5/5Network - 4.5/5Sound - 3.5/5Gaming - 4/5*Comfortable one hand use*Big advantage of Oxygen OS*Overall very good balance device

"
"

  Like:The build and feel is really premium. Doesn't feel like a mid ranger.The screen and display is premiumDislikes:The camera doesn't live up to the hype.Macro lens is really horribleSound quality not upto the mark.Single speaker.

"
"

  Overall a good daily driver. Fingerprint reader and face unlock is pretty fast. Camera is better than average but not superb. The biggest USP would be oxygen OS which is clean no bloatware. Overall the phone is fast have not experienced any lagging so far.

"
"

  Pros:+ Oxygen OS+ Battery+Main cameras (front and rare)+ SpeakerCons- No earphone Jack on midrange phone- Display ( screen flickering issue)- Other cameras- Auto screen brightness issueAs I got this on exchange for 17k it is worth.

"
"

  This phone is one of the best phones I ever used but the problem that I have is that the new update that got in a lot of bugs it is barable for a few more weeks but OnePlus needs to fix it. The front camera can record at 4k 60fps but the rear camera can only record at 4k 30fps.

"
"

  Multiple problems in this phone.Pros:Fast performanceCons:Substandard cameraMost of the popular games have compatibility issuesContacts displaying have problemCall recording feature is uselessGoogle apps do not work (although provided with oxygen OS) example: Google search bar

"
"

  The camera quality is absolutely stunning. True to its word, OnePlus has indeed given a flagship camera. Battery life is great! Charging speeds are super fast and performance is a beast in this phone. A must buy for everyone looking for the best phone under 30,000. Would highly suggest the OnePlus buds or Bullets wireless 2 or Z.

"
"

  Super mobileAmazing performanceNot godd camera as Samsung S series and iphoneHDR looks like cheper redmi phone

"
"

  Oneplus is offering almost everything at this price.... overall the phone performance is also good....but fingerprint is not as fast as other phone in this segment.....and there are also some network related issues....apart from all this I like the phone very much.....u should go for it...

"
"

  It isn't the best but we r getting a flagship like mobile at normal price so be it guys dont have any complaints with the tint in the dark and only worst thing is its macro lens better it wasnt there

"
"

  I ordered the product in flash sales opened on 14 September, 2020,on very next day i got it early morning, by coming end of the month i noticed that it's not taking efficient pictures in front of other devices and i found that lenses were full of dust, i observed one plus nord is dust megnatic phone since first day of holding it

"
"

  Good phone under 30k. Snapdragon 765 performance is good, display quality is good for this price,battery life improved with latest update.

"
"

  Don't go for this if you are looking for good camera and battery. Battery drains very fast. And if i zoom a little bit while taking a photo pixels scatters drastically. Very disappointed with camera and battery. Pls go for another mobile... Genuine feedback from an user... Trust me.

"
"

  Everything is Great for the price. Kid of like premium budget. Only issue I felt was when shifting from iphone, all WhatsApp data is lost. Also while on call the other person's voiceis less sharp. A lot of bugs were reported automatically in just 3-4 days of usage. Since it's new so there might be a future problem.

"
"

  Waste of money.. Volume rocker working slowly, some apps getting freezed.. The processor ain't that fast they claim it is to be.. Also the front camera quality isn't quite impressive.. I been using one plus mobiles ( one plus 6T, one plus 6, one plus 7 pro)  since 2018,can't  say It's a worth purchase.. #nordsucks

"
"

  Did the biggest mistake by buying the ONEPLUS nord. It started giving issues in 2 weeks and they have horrible service support and even the service center does not know what do to. Instead add a few more bucks and go for iphone or samsung, atleast you won't have to go through the mental stress of loss huge amount.

"
"

  Dont buy this phnFlop model,,,,,Display issuesAnd phn is lagging some timesGo for samsung M51

"
"

  Well balance phone with 765G processor work very fast, finger unlock very fast, and also long lasting battery with amazing warp 30 fast charging. Oxygen os is having good user interface. Its a great experience.

"
"

  Overall an nice product. But my budget was arround 17 to 18 had to spend more money. Just for nord branding and marketing.

"
"

  if you are looking for gaming and stuff don't waste your time in this product bcoz for gaming you can find other cheap options, but if you understand the value of processors and use phone for the classy and professional purpose this is the best thing you can buy.At the professional level, it's awesome

"
"

  Phone is good but camera quality expectations is disappointed.....

"
"

  While using this phone it feels like premium , without a doubt go for it.Good camera , Oxygen Os system, better battery life, battery full charge in less an hour,90 Hz refresh rate...so on . Good job OnePlus üëç

"
"

  There is pink tint issue in my phone,only noticable in night time in below 25% brightness.

"
"

  Worst experience everSelfie camera display bending issues so much annoying in night usage..

"
"

  Highly overrated mobile. Camera is average, battery life is pathetic. I  switched from 4 year old OnePlus 3 , trusting the OnePlus brand, but I was really disappointed. Many corners have been cut, and those are important corners like battery, display, camera etc..

"
"

  The OnePlus Nord is a great example of how to make a ‚ÄòLite‚Äô device that doesn‚Äôt feel cheap. Essentials such as a 90Hz display, fast charging and performance to satisfy most users. The cameras aren‚Äôt the best, but for the price, we wouldn‚Äôt complain much. Even if not a flagship, it is still a killer.

"
"

  Awesome phone.. looks smart, working super smoothly, camera quality is tremendous..If planning for your 1st OnePlus phone this is the best choice in this price range

"
"

  Best Phone in this range, Great camera, Processor ok, nice display.Not for pro gamers.Others can buy without any doubt.

"
"

  Though this is Chinese phone, but at this price I think I have got good phone.Still feeling that i have taken wrong decision buying chinese product

"
"

  Awesome display, loud mono speaker, camera working perfect after updates, battery is decent for normal users, it has almost everything u ask for.Ppl are complaining about camera and display but i dont find any issue.Gamers can opt for other devices but for normal users... This smartphone is a beast.

"
"

  Major drawback , sometimes Bluetooth automatically gets off .or doesn't connect only.in this we can't connect headphones so you have to use Bluetooth or else you can buy 3mm jack so that u can use headphones.

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus mobile. As compared to other mobiles, Nord is really impressed me on its performance, fingerprint reader. I am feeling the 90Hz refresh rate, it's really amazing. I can not compare the camera of this phone with others. But picture quality is also very good.I would suggest to go with this phone.

"
"

  Nice but phn is heating

"
"

  Performance is gr8. REAR CAMERA IS GR8. Mobile brightness is little bit low. Don't go for the negative reviews you should go for this. Value for money. I'll give a detailed review after a month. AMAZING BATTER LIFE.

"
"

  Camera is okish ,samsung offers great photograpgy prowess in much cheaper phones than this one.I charge the phone twice daily to complete the entire day (in their defence iam on my phone all day long, and use it for hotspot)Performance is good as any other OnePlus device .

"
"

  Phone always in mute mode, no any option to set it as sound mode.At the same time no any options to call settings.

"
"

  Everything is good but camera is not up to the mark.as usual battery life is not so good backup in OnePlus series .I don't know why OnePlus lack in battery whether it will be affect  any other internal chip set activities Or weight management I don't know over all not fair

"
"

  Dear, Camera quality not good as we can expect on this prise and battery Life not good automatically going down without uaing. Finaly this prise we can expect some other phones in very low prise.

"
"

  My Nord started to overheat the day I got it. I put it on charging and it got so hot from behind that I could not hold it for long. Why is that happening? Did not expect this from Nord.

"
"

  Good mobile with good performance.Captures good snaps in daylight & turns bit sad in the low light.Battery drains fast compared to other mobiles.If you prefer games then batter drains very fast. Runs very smooth. Overall a good product to buy.

"
"

  Now don't get me wrong when I say this, the camera is amazing, but it does have some room for improvement. Other than that, with the Oxygen 11 features to come into play, the phone is just amazing.

"
"

  battery doesn't even last a day even on moderate /low usage ana charging takes lot of time.no fast charge.contacted amazon for replacement on the same day as delivery, they have arranged for mobile inspection after 5 days of complaint to accept the replacement request.don't buy this product.

"
"

  Received the product on 28th August 20, fingerprint reader n face reader access is superb...but battery back is bit low...camera quality is excellent ... Audio n video are good...colour is mind blowing...overall rating four star...

"
"

  Build quality is good can be better,fluid amoled with indisplay finger print is really osm with 90hz ,battery backup is really good in this device it's well optimised,and the device fells buttery smooth with oxygen os,got SOT about 6 hrs will change my review after a week

"
"

  Cons1.Camera quality is not compared to other one plus2.Even though it is 4000 mah battery the life is not good3.While playing music some time google assistance will switch on automatically

"
"

  After 3days of usage i can say the phone feels good on hand and the weight management is good. The only con is the camera.

"
"

  Oxygen OS is a wonderful experience.Battery life is good.Main camera is to the mark but the selfie camera is okiesh!Overall a very good product in budget.I gave 4 stars earlier but now I am editing it to 5 star . Oneplus has given me multiple updates which improved the front camera quality.Its Amazinggggg now!!

"
"

  One thing I dislike most that everytime I call someone it says call recording has been initiated which is worst that other person is able to know that he or she is being recorded ...wtf one plus, wtf ü§¶.. anyway overall is excellent but still I demanding please give me new updates so my problem get resolved.

"
"

  Serious network issue. Call gets dropped automatically . The network suddenly disappears and the call is disconnected. Has happened with every call since I stat using the device which I received yesterday. No help from Oneplus on how to rectify the issue. It seems that many users are having the same problem.

"
"

  One of the worst product ever from OnePlus,guys please don't buy this it has Various manufacturing defects like pinkish tint and green tint , display is of cheap quality,worst camera except that 48 MP....don't waste your time and money on buying this...... almost every user facing green tint issues do check it on twitter

"
"

  I thought full of expectations on Oneplus nord but really disappointed.. phone built is very good nd one hand feel supab but battery drains fast up to 3 hrs only everyday i chargerd 3times , pink tints nd no voice clariey . So i return the phone ... I request u after arriving the phone plz check it 3 days then u know ...

"
"

  This product is good but battery backup, camera is very bad. But fingerprint reader is very fast i love this smartphone.gaming performance is good but 60 fps and HDR not supported.vivo x50 pro also have 765g but this device support 60 fps and HDR. I request to oneplus plz give hdr and 60 fps by software update.thank you.

"
"

  Phone totally perfectBut only front camera performance not well I don't think 32 mp.Heavy phone compared  to OnePlus 7,5,5t,6,6tOverall best phone in budget

"
"

  Battery life is not so good battery charging is very fast, camera quality is very very good ,if you search contact list very difficult to find the name.if you ask me not so good phoone.

"
"

  Excellent camera quality. Awesome battery life.. no issues till date on finger print reader which is also pretty fast.

"
"

  ¬†Camera is bad for low lighting conditions, display is choppy, attached video for reference.Speed is goodNot Suggested!Samsung is UnbeatableOverall Bad decision to opt for Oneplus!

"
"

  The size of the product is really very good easy to handle with one hand that I like the most, but but but on the very first day I experienced some red dot on display and screen was not working it and I have to restart it I don't know what it was so it's the geniune review and rest all up to u

"
"

  After 10 days of usage phone is not getting switched onNever expected this from oneplus

"
"

  Everything in this phone is good but I got some issues in pubg but in gameplay it is smooth and nice but when I have to enter in the game most of the time it shows that check network connection and it got disconnected and except this all are good. I have used this for 5 days and it feels good and nice phone from OnePlus

"
"

  After using 1 month i am writing this review :1. Back Camera quality- 10/102. Front camera - 9/103. Battery - 6/104. Charging speed - 10/105. Touch screen quality- 10/106. Sensitivity - 10/107. Sound -10/108. Speed - 10/109. Phone heating problem - 8/10

"
"

  Bought this only for camera . It is big Let down. Should have waited for Pixel 4a. Can't return

"
"

  Battery life superb

"
"

  Battery life 10/10Value for money 10/10Camera 9/10Look 10/10Body 10/10OS 10/10

"
"

  Please do not buy this mobile from amazon.i have problem with camera and graphic issue but they are not resolving my problem and not returning my phone.tottaly waste my money 28k. I suggest to buy phone with your door step shop.

"
"

  Phone hangs at-least twice a days and switches off automatically, third party apps like amazon prime video hangs, myntra shopping hangs. One plus support does not pick any calls. The issues did not occur within first 7 days of exchange policy now sadly have to return.Would not recommend the phone to anyone.

"
"

  Don't buy this crap. Battery life is pathetic. It is a fast charging as well as fast discharging phone.Poor network access in comparison to redmi note 8 pro and iphone.Don't buy.

"
"

  Best dealer definitely good phone and no screen issue or no factory reset problem is there working fine don't warry about the phone it's very good battery one time charge is needed in whole day and maximum it takes 30 to 45 min. To charge from 0 to some one around 80 - 82 . No problem in camera it's good.

"
"

  Classy phone in this price bracket

"
"

  Best mid range phone, the Oxygen OS is smooth & realistic. Size is perfect as the phone can be operated in one hand. Camera is quality is same as oneplus 8 quality.  Overall more than what you ask for.

"
"

  Best product in this segmentCamera quality improved after updateAmazing DisplayAverage battery lifeGood chargerLovely Oxygen OSAll in All a Perfect PhoneValue for Money

"
"

  fingerprint reader is very powerfull,the biggest problem of oneplus nord is battery draining and it gives 4115 mh battery but its not work very will so i request you to please improve the battery power,than the camara quality was disant not so good and not so bad.so i request you to please improve battery life.thank you

"
"

  I have little concerned on battery life and back cover provided by OnePlus is not so good, other things like camera, feel, fingerprint reader.Delivery for this product was very poor, I got my phone approx 13 days after the booking.No means of pre-booking.

"
"

  ¬†I don't know why phn get automatics restart but it not go ahead.

"
"

  Reviewing after a month usage.Performance wise superb.Small bugs like speakers not working, volume rocker key working automatically but AFTER the ota update it's fixed.Display average compare to other amoled displays.Battery charing and draining also fast.However under 30k it best phone.

"

  Lovely phone got delivery yesterday. My first phone without an  iPhone . As m using only iPhone right from iPhone  5 to 7s .Features are good. Super fast charging and lovely display and sound quality. Camera I felt I phone has a better camera. It's easy to use . Full screen phone . It's worth buying a value for money

"
"

  All fine except camera and batter.Battery draining very fast also some heating issue.Also you have to wait for 2-3 sec after taking picture otherwise you'll get shakey picture.

"
"

  Is my personal use for this regarding this product it's a battery issue it as compared to other device and also personally feedback to Amazon deliveryI am replace the product two times but two times I have received the damaged packaging and use product it feel like a open someone and I said to my mobile

"
"

  Except for the Camera üì∏ it's excellent... Camera is Average.. OnePlus 7T has better camera than this. Regarding display Issue..Yeah it's Well Noticeable when you are In dark room & low brightness... Purple & greenish tinge occurs...In bright Conditions it's perfect

"
"

  Camera Quality is not good main camera not supported zoom and selfi camera is low quality. 48 mp camera not working only 12 mp camera works long distance photo very very poor quality

"
"

  I am using one plus 6 from last two years.My experience is fabulous so I decided to buy this for my better half.Just received the phone so will write detail review later. But look wise 10 out of 10

"
"

  The packaging from Amazon keeping in mind it is a expensive phone was very basis and that cause the phone box to have a lot of scratches this gives the idea dat the parcel was not taken care property no complains with regards to the product as it is awesome but Amazon being the best delivery service disappointed me.

"
"

  The battery life is quite good which lasts up to 8 hours after an heavy usage. Games run smooth with with default graphic settings. Fingerprint scanner is fast and face unlock is just superb. App lock must be updated.

"
"

  Initial impression is good..Cons1) Finger print is good but can't disable the fingerprint illumination.2) Camera quality is not like from an OnePlus product.3) In Night time without usage there is a drop of 5% though it is in flight mode.Other cons if any will be updated..

"
"

  ¬†Mobile automatically hanged,& display light was a automatically on & off.& Second issue is no call record in Nord device.

"
"

  First time user of OnePlus. Very excited üòÄ, everything is fine, if any bug is there OnePlus will send updates to maintain his brand, so don't think for the low rating reviews. Just go for it. Only I request one plus to solve the battery and camera issue.

"
"

  Premier look that blue marble and sharp fingerprint readers and good sound qualityLow light photography is worst front cam is worst .good wifi speed and data speed aloso pretty good.Overall a good phone.Wrap charger is awesome

"
"

  phone is overall the best but oneplus is became trash !! ... :< junk apps found on the phone .... and there updates isnt as good as it used to be ....but slowly improving this phone isnt ready and possible display issue isnt worth spending 28k to me sadly ... but either way okay phone.

"
"

  Good and excellent mobile for middle class family...OnePlus is brand mobile excellent specifications, display cemera. Mobile operation... Fast charging.. and new features...

"
"

  Worst phone not worth of buyingAt that high cost ,quality of selfie camera is worst, no audio port, and sound quality is of very poor quality since there is only one speaker which is not stereo quality.

"
"

  Not excellent it is an average mobile....Only hyped up by marketing.

"
"

  Everything is pretty premium , you won't have any problems software or hardware wiseCameras a bit average but its fine the rest of the package is incredibleAlthough i would have preferred a single selfie camera , dual cams not really usefull since I don't take a lot of selfies3.8 out of 5 for me.

"
"

  I completely regret buying this phone,From the day I bought it,the performance of this mobile is worst, never expected such thing from oneplus, There is a huge network issue in this phone and it hangs a lot, suddenly it gets switched off by itself,I just feel I wasted my 30k.

"
"

  Plz don't buy this phone,it's not worth value money.camer is very very poor and ui hang issue ,and there is no fonts support in this phone, not expect more in the phone. Really this phone value is 15k to 17k..over hipeing.its really bad money is waste. I expect more but its can't reach my expections.

"
"

  So many negative reviews, In my personal opinion RAM management , Optimised UI, Amoled Panel and free of Bloatware, Ads is all you need along with software updates for next 2 years as promised by OnePlus. let's see how that turns out.So far so good.No complaints at this price.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is good and battery lost for one day with the usage of social media ,camera quality is little bit difficult not as expected ,sound quality is nice ,if you play games for an hour the battery slightly last longer upto 20hrs that's it.Coming to overall phone quality it's good üôÇ

"
"

  Sound system pathetic, camera why they have given micro use less. Network issue net speed is very slow as compared to other phone in same service provider. Don't buy.....in Hindi dhobhi ka kutta na premium ka na base varient ka......

"
"

  Must say a lovely colour .Good phone in  the mid range section .Being from one Plus durabikity should be good .The selfie camera is good and the Bokeh is better than the rear camera .Also uses beautification of the photos .But overall not a bad purchase

"
"

  Overall the phone is nice. Its a budget cell with good user experience but battery life is bit a issue. Cell is 5G enabled and touch is good too.its a must buy phone if your budget is low.

"
"

  One of the best phones in such a budget! Looks impressive, the camera is much better then other products in this budget! The best part item is delivered within 6 hours. Thanks to Amazon for the amazing delivery and phone too

"
"

  OnePlus nord has the worst heating issue. Please don't go for it & the customer support is so pathetic also.

"
"

  One of the cheapest quality mobile from one Plus it's i bought it on 21 September sale and after 6 days it's stop working and automatically getting restart Amazon denied for return now now i have to waste my time in service center i would suggest u please don't buy this mobile if u don't want to waste your money.

"
"

  Expected too much with this smart phone but at the end result is quite shocking for me. There are plenty issue I'm facing like,1.fingerprint acess works slow as of now the Android devices I have used.2.Battery backup is less as per the capacity is given.3.Heating issue while charging the device.

"
"

  I'm a little dissatisfied with the camera quality. Despite the 48 MP sensor pics come out a little blurry sometimes. Low light imaging could also use a major upgrade. Screen also has some issues but those are more software related so OnePlus better patch that soon. Rest, this is an awesome mid range mobile phone.

"
"

  I have more expetations on this Mobile for Ping But this gudjet is not suitable for gaming and I saw  all reviews and Unboxing of Nord mobile  there mobile and three pouches are given but in my order  not given any other pouces  Only give  One Clear pouch give with mobile,nd no pre apply any glassüòó

"
"

  a 5days agoNo problems with the phone. Read and watched many reviewed before deciding to buy this one.Excellent spec, beautiful design, no major bloat ware, clean OS. Having dual SIM makes sense for a business and personal number. Having 5G makes the device ...Charging is very fast

"
"

  The entire system otherwise runs fine but camera is a sheer disappointment . Not really worth the money ,you can go for the 25 K modle if one plus Nord is the choice and storage space is not an issue . Would not suggest to buy a phone for 28K or 30K . Not satisfied. Overall rating maybe as much as 3.9

"
"

  Design and performance is Excellent with same hardware like other OnePlus range. Getting regular updates as improvement in software.Function should be increase because MI phones giving some effective and usable functions in their lowbudget phones also

"
"

  I bought 12+256 Gray Onyx and have been using it for a 20 days now. I am satisfied. 90 Hz refresh rate is smooth and battery backup is good. Oxygen OS is free of bloatware and seamless. Love it. I will keep posting as I discover more.

"
"

  Good mobile , one Plus forget bettry why because in nord has 4130m battery but it was not sufficient iam very normal use not gamer and browser , but it was only 10 h backup so think before buy this

"
"

  I'm giving 1 star because of no automatic call recording feature. When i start call recording other side person also got voice notification. ""Your call has been recorded "". This is big disappointment thing.

"
"

  Not happy with phone battery backup very low . Not compaired with 4115 mah battery very poor battery backup

"
"

  It's soo greatThe great display ,good performance and battery backup ,Overall a good phoneI purchased the phn for that damm good blue colourUpdated--The performance is great,but battery drains fast when in 90 Hz ,but that was expected,,well it's tooo good and smooth.-BNOrD

"
"

  It's been few days since I got the phone And it's really Amazing. Design is good. Fingerprint reader is fast. Battery life last for slightly less than full day if your usage is hardcore. Camera quality is not like flagship camera s but still at this price one of the best cameras. Overall really Amazing product.

"
"

  I bought  on September 8 OnePlus nord 12gb ...but after 15days it's speaker is not working properly.calling voice is not come clear.Camera üì∏ in joom shots very poor image quality.Sound- speaker is also very poor quality.Before this nord I was using OnePlus 5T that was good phone in its range.

"
"

  Totally happy and satisfied with my this purchase this phone has everything what you are looking in a premium phone it's really affordable and awesome phone totally love in this phone üòç

"
"

  If you have professional work so don't go for this Oneplus phone. Also Oneplus using GOOGLE PHONE APP that's VERY VERY VERY IRRITATING app for use. Phone lagging if you using navigation gestures. Camera quality like redmi's 10-12k phones.NO AUTO CALL RECORDING.BATTERY DRAINING SO FAST.

"
"

  Camera gets massive improvement after updateNow Google ads AR core support to the phoneSmooth near stock android experienceFreq software update from one plusA good buy for 27k

"
"

  The most worst experience  . Don't  buy oneplus nord because  after using 20 days the phone mother board destroyed  and the phone become a empty box of 28000 and I have to visit  service  centre . It have manufacturing  defect . Manufacturing  of the phone is of poor quality.....oneplus customer  care told me.

"
"

  Battery life is really low. Yes it supports fast charging but you might need that twice a day even with an average useage.Even after the update the video quality of the front camera has not been up to the mark gives an unnecessary pale shade.The finger print reader works really well and super fast.

"
"

  This screenshot is from the OnePlus diagnostic app which shows the battery health.i have bought this on sep 14 and in one month the battery health was reduced to 86% . I donno why this happened. So is this because of the updates or the manufacturing defect ? OnePlus has to fix the battery drain issue for nord.

"
"

  Nord is a good phone and overall the running and processing experience is very good in this phone but there's something more that if OnePlus should provided in this then this is going to be killer like almunium frame and at least 4500mah battery other than everything is excellent about this phone

"
"

  I don't know how but my phone. Better was just like damaged because when ever i used it or not the battery still remains drained . I didn't understand what to do with this product. I ordered one plus 8 pro first but didn't face these problems . If ur looking for this please check the review first

"
"

  Phone is good in all aspects. If you wish to experience oxy os, you can buy it. Camera quality in day are excellent and for night it needs to be improved. If android is my choice I will go with one plus. But they mentioned it as budget but it's not that's a only drawback.

"
"

  Taking 4 stars because of the purple tint in the display, never expected from oneplus, i should have gone for the x2 pro. It is very noticeable in pitch black environment. I was annoyed with this, i never review products usually but this i had to. Will change the ratings if the problem is solved.

"
"

  Little bit camera quality need to improve... I think it can be done by some software update no big issue....Don't worry abt battery lyf....Easy one day lyf fr hard user also....Charging speed upto 70% in half an hour.....

"
"

  Don't go for negative reviews. I was literally shocked when i saw the negative reviews.I am using this phone since last one week just thanks to OnePlus entire team to make such type of phone at this range. Worth of money.

"
"

  Light in hand,Beautiful camera quality,Slik n slim smarphone.Highly recommended to buy.Also a mid range phone.Thanks Amazon for superfast delivery.

"
"

  ¬†The camera is decent and also the battery performance is up to mark,screen is gr8 ,my opinion if you want to buy a camera phone go for it and also the gaming is also good and after sometime it will be getting an update to play pubg in extreme graphics ,go for it üëç

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is a good option for buying a 5g phone. but , OnePlus Nord's camera quality is poor. But over all the phone is best.And the phone heats after playing two PUBG games. But it's a good phone üì±. I am telling you it is very good phone

"
"

  Bought and returned item. My unit had a pinkish tint on display and battery was draining very fast. Playing a 480p video for 15 mins itself drained 8% battery. I could get only 5 hrs battery backup with light use. Amazon helped me return this faulty product as there was no scope for replacement.

"
"

  This is the best mid range phone. Camera & UI is great.

"
"

  Phone is too responsive, camera is good, however battery drain is like a big hole in pipe!! It does not retain charge.. I was browsing fb.. few other web pages and it was like 1%charge would drop every 2 minutes.Apart from this, rest looks fine, but this is really frustrating...

"
"

  Camera good, but battery life not good..gallery get delete without confirmation.essage do u wish to del.. notification led missing..Amazon not customer care based now.. became purely business mind.Couldn't give satisfied level work to customer..Totally I disappointed.I got loss due to Amazon..

"
"

  Overall a good phone from one plus.Nothing extra ordinary.Camera is good but not upto the mark.Build quality is very good.Display and touch screen is well.Battery and fast charger is there but now a days every smart phone of this range provide the same.

"
"

  After using it for a month.. I'll recommend not to buy this phone.. instead of this you must go for OnePlus 7t.. this phone hangs.. camera is also not up to the mark.. battery life is also not good

"
"

  I recieved this phone this morning only...and I am not experiencing any lag or glitch...The phone has excellent performance...The packing of the phone was also of very good quality....

"
"

  Super mobile battery backup is awesome camara same time blur issue looking mbl full freety speaker sounds good

"
"

  I have used this for a day and I have to say it's very very good to use.Can't go wrong with OnePlus.I see no issues as I heard about different colour at low light.No issues with screen.

"
"

  It's good with the software experience and use the on hand experienceYes have a decent camera with a light conditions and dark area conditions have not up to mark resultsBut overall all with price range it's good option to buy if camera is not first priority

"
"

  As Nord comes with Oneplus 8/8Plus camera, i expected lot from Nord Camera. Frankly i am very dissapointed with the experience. I am using for 1 month+ now. Maybe some update will come.. Hope so.

"
"

  Camera is looking grainy both front and back ultra wide is poor overall highly disappointed is better to go with oneplus 7Texcept camera is good I will give 4out of 5 for performancefor camera 2/5If u want better camera go with K20 pro or oneplus 7T don't waste money for 1plus symbol

"
"

  Camera quality is good. If you will compare OnePlus 6 and 6T which is having 20 & 16 MP camera is better than OnePlus nord 48 MP camera.Not satisfied with camera quality.

"
"

  Super  mobile...  display quality super....Battry life.. 2days

"
"

  The phone is the champion of this price range. It feels like a flagship when you do actually lay your hands on it.......it's the best phone you can get under 30k.

"
"

  Best Phone in 2020.

"
"

  Super smooth experience.. no lag or delay.. charging speed is lighting fast...60% recharge happens in 30 mins..Very good phone.. overall Scores 9 out of 10.. considering performance, display quality, battery life , camera, future ready..

"
"

  Should I say anything about this beast. Complete package of everything you need at an affordable price. Really the experience with Nord is great. In hand feeling, the screen, the look, the camera everything is really superb. If you are looking for the best phone under 30k you should go for it.

"
"

  Battery is moderateCamera:Wide range of camera is awesomeNight shots are really goodBut normal range camera photos are not so up to markLook:Its look premium

"
"

  Best smarphone ever it's just so smooth and comes up with flawless performance. Battery life and fast charging is just awesome. It's almost 12 days using this phone I just loved it.

"
"

  Amazon could have handled delivery and packaging well. Received product with minor damages on the box. At one moment i thought this product is used because i couldn‚Äôt see a seal on it. Later i found it. One plus should use better packaging. Product is working fine and as expected.

"
"

  I purchased one plus nord yesterday.  There is a big problem with phone. Phone is getting switched off automatically. It happens randomly. There is no fixed pattern. it seems it's getting crashed even there is no app running.Trying to follow up with amazon and one plus to get it resolved or replaced.

"
"

  If you are planning to buy one plus nord seeing one plus branding , then please don't buy. Its completely waste of money. Worst camera ever, the phone hangs , camera screen flickers, network is really poor. Everyone is facing the same problem.. buy pixel 4a or iphone se instead wasting money on this phone.

"
"

  It's design looking very good . Battery life wasbin pubg almost 5 hours but charging capacity was too good almost 40 min in charge upto 70 %. Other wise this product very good in this price. Last two months i waiting for this phone when I was sew first time that felling is gorgeous ....Thanx one Plus

"
"

  This phone just wow.... completely impressed i was worried that i didnt saw phone yet even dont know how in hand look but to be really i love this really appreciate the work done by oneplus just i didnt like ghe camera but ya it can be fix with dome updates

"
"

  Extremely bad battery backup.Performance of the phone is really up to the mark.Finger print reader is also outstanding than samsung phone.Single firing speaker is not that loud.Not happy with battery and speaker.

"
"

  Awesome phone. I am using it since 15-20 days & it's worth the money. Very satisfied with the product. Pros: Fast Charging, Amazing finger print, No lag, photos quality are superb as well. It's feature packed phone. Cons: Not found yet.

"
"

  My pre-order arrived almost most late than 10 days. I hope it can improve.Phone is good but boasted camera is not better than OP 6T dual cam. Processor is also older than it's 2 year older models

"
"

  EXPECTED LITTLE BETTER.....BUT A GOOD DEVICE....i would like to request oneplus please work on battery life and head phone.....as Normal user but battery and head phone jack needed....i am tell you(oneplus) i am a huge fan of one plus brand and one plus nord is my first experience as per my budget...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

"
"

  I bought this for my sister expecting that the overall product would be thought through, because it belongs to OnePlus family. But really disappointed with the camera quality. It feels pixelated with all kind of settings. Better to go with oppo or realme, you would get a really nice product in this range.

"
"

  a wonderful products

"
"

  Only Replace no return??Please don't buy, lot of technical issues with this phone1. Speaker if turned on, does not get turned off2. Recording function is very loudly says call getting recorded3. Poor battery life4. Camera quality is not upto the mark

"
"

  It is not upto the mark as previous one plus phones ,It Don‚Äôt have the automatic call record saving option to Files.Every time we need to share someone , save these audio files

"
"

  Fingerprint reader doesn't fetch finger properly, although OnePlus have fast chargelung system but still it drains battery also very fast, camera quality is worst and worthless waste of money

"
"

  Got worried  .... After 10 days of usage .....my phone automatically rebooted for several hours ....i don't why ??? .I can't able to return my phone ...... Badly disappointed .........

"
"

  Why macro camera given? ..... OnePlus creater r u mad ? What a disgusting product?mid-range premium not this is third class mobile .... And camera is weired .... Selfie is third class .... It take pictures like 2 mp camera.....so much blurry ..... 12 mp camera is bad ..... 6T is so batter than this .....

"
"

  Camera is very poor as far as now I hope one+ will fix it in software updates. I think there is an issue with sim card management. Sometimes sim card automatically goes inactive. Otherwise gaming, finger print reader, battery everything is good.

"
"

  Overall phone is ok..Camera is very cheap not expected from oneplus....Its just a market gimic on cameras .they even not even better under 15k....Main problem is camera performance hope they will fix it from software updates...

"
"

  Wonderful phone. Awesome device by oneplus. Value for money. All specs are as a FLAGSHIP. I truely loved it.best buy... GO FOR IT..

"
"

  Pros :Smooth experiencePremium feelLight weightSome amazing featuresOxygenOSDisplayTouchCons :Battery drains a bit fast(30W charging compensates for that so no issues as such)Macro lens of poor quality

"
"

  OnePlus is amazing brand. Fingerprint reader very fast and camera quality awasome. this is best phone under 30k.

"
"

  1 plus nord lags sometimes, i shows no response suddenly for 1 min. It gets heat up while charging and not that fast charging as 30 warp charger should give. In a day, functioning lags 6 times. Better not to buy it. Go for 1 plus 8pro far better. 1plus always fails in case of budget phones.

"
"

  I'm writing this after using my phone after two days even it is too early to say but it's my turn to say that I'm happy to be a part of the one plus family with its latest Nord version though having some cons but it's amazing performance giving me nice experience thanks for one plus team üòä

"
"

  I have 8gb RAM one plus Nord.Even with minimal use like call and browsing. The battery hardly lasts a day.I have all optimisations in place with 60hz refresh rate.My old one plus 5t had better battery life.Camera also seems to be average

"
"

  Not as expected. Very very average mobile from one plus. 90hz refresh rate was disappointing. Finger print sensor going blackout suddenly. So many issues.Amazon won't care even if raise any complaint. Once delivered there end their responsibility and thereon you need to roam around for any issues.

"
"

  It's a nice phone Display is great. Camera 8/10. Ram is great 12gb,256gb storage is very sufficient for mobile users. Battery life is very nice for gaming , recording (not for 4k)... normal usage etc etc... internet speed is also very nice .... fast charging is amazing full battery in just 50to60 mins .

"
"

  If you want to use oxygen at any any cost then only go for it1--battery is below avg ,2--camera is very bad ,and3--green tint is very irritating you will notice at any point anytimedon't buy k20 is best option

"
"

  Apart from all good questies... The phone is little heavy , and the projected camera.. Is a problem in long term without cover..Rest the phone is a great choise.... Go for it

"
"

  The product is wonderful on such a price, but the seller send me a damaged product and refunded me but i actually wanted a replacement....too disappointed...everyday trying to buy another one from oneplus.in but i can't...so eagerly waiting for 20 th augest...

"
"

  At first I was sceptical about the slight yellow tint from the display as I've never used an OLED panel before. But now I'm used to it.  The only thing that bothers me is the haptic feedback which is nit quite as strong as I'm used to so it took me a while to familiar myself with it.

"
"

  Absolutely fantastic with Amazon camera superpBattery superb and display is awesome everything in this phone in this price segment is next level no one can beat OnePlusExtra comment i had totally check the display is no issue there no green tilt or something10 on 10

"
"

  Value for Money. If you are looking for mobile phone under 30k then there is no other choice as of now in comparison to Nord. Oneplus nailed it with 90hz amoled display, camera, design and oxygen OS. JUST GO FOR IT.

"
"

  First OnePlus upgrade and totally worth it. Solid performance( SD 765G is very underrated), Good camera well it be much better with coming updates, Good battery and super smooth 90hz super AMOLED display.

"
"

  Look is beautiful, fast processor. Excellent battery life. Camera is good.Still exploring new features ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"
"

  I am not fully satisfied on one plus nord,there are some problem in camera like I have not vedio recorded 60fps in front camera. In pubg I enter match again and again I don't know why it is happened or heating problem after 20 min only play pubg.But overall performance is good I have only rare problem.

"
"

  Amazon is giving pathetic service. Just now the display of the OnePlus mobile has gone.. I am trying to avail the product support which I am eligible for but the page is not leading to any help centre neither the customer service people are contacting me! Its a 30k mobile and it's display has gone off!

"
"

  Nord is the best for those who are using One Plus first time as compared to the existing users camera quality is best and sometimes it is hang and sim also deactivated automatically of slot 2.

"
"

  ONEplus being a step ahead with the snapdragon 765G in the mid range premium. So its a good choice as oneplus keeps its devices upto date with regular updates. Camera quality works good in noise and traffic conditions and low light imaging good at this price range.

"
"

  Built well, comfortable design90Hz AMOLED display5G-ready processorGood daylight camera performanceSolid battery lifeNord Receiving OxygenOS 10.5.7Software Update With Improvements for Camera, Display, Power Consumption, and More

"
"

  This can be considered as the best phone in mid range budget. Kudos to One Plus for launching this  phone.

"
"

  A good phone to have...one plus is always a trusted brand to own..don't look at the paid technical reviews of all negative things that are said about this phone....own it and you won't be despointed

"
"

  Very Nice Mobile

"
"

  Overall the mobile is excellent but its automatically comes on factory data reset whenever put it into the pocket, i did 4 attempts to start the phone till now from the date I bought the mobile such a bad experience with purchasing mobile online. Don't buy this product üôèüôèüôè

"
"

  Battery gets discharged very quickly , need to charge the phone 3 times in a day , worthless battery. What's the point of buying a 20k+ phone if it u r getting battery issues within months of buying, ultimately a Chinese product. :(

"
"

  I don't like the 1st pic that i have take otherwise I'm enjoying to use the phone

"
"

  So good!!!. Just in love with this smartphone! Only con is it doesn't have an earphone jack. Otherwise everything is good.

"
"

  Battery backup is not good. My full charge battery only work 4-5hrs.As mentioned in the add abt the battery quality n backup also good but not it's good. If you want same range of mobiles then u can go with another options. There are many options available in the market like samsung Galaxy M31.

"
"

  Not Worthy Of 28k. I am having Blue marble 8gb, 128gb. Over hyped. Over price... Heat too much during recording video. Camera is below average. Even other below 20k phones have better camera. Battery life is average I will tell....Only pros are its OS and Processor....I will not recommend

"
"

  Fast device performance ,

"
"

  Worst product from OnePlus. After using this mobile, am having internet issues. The speed is too low when using on both data and WIFI. Camera quality is disastrous. Selfie camera is the worst feature. Battery issues are also there.

"
"

  Beautiful mobile in the mid rangeü§©, Very happy though!One plus Nord really awesome at this price they are giving a 5g with slot of specs.

"
"

  Writing this review after 15 days of usage.Camera is not to the expectations what they promoted.Decent battery lifeFingerprint needs 3 sec to unlockSometimes the phone goes to silent or vibrateNever recommend !! You can buy this phone only for the Name ONE+

"
"

  Big issue network problem some time very low network connection my old phone support very well same place but this phone not supporting games also don't  believe the mobile reviewer YouTube channel command and recommend this phone..This phone only buildup brand OnePlus otherwise worsted

"
"

  Super I like this mobile

"
"

  This is my first one plus phone, When I received phone some issue in battery but after update OS it's fixed.. camera quality is nice, fingerprint sensor is ok not as fast as another one plus series, overall phone is superb light weight easily to use one handed..

"
"

  Very good on looks n hardware. Extremely unstable on network reception; keeps hanging, gets stuck to one dot on screen n other colored dots rotating around it. Doesn't reboot when u want it to.Avoid the handset purchase for the price ur paying for an unstable software it carries.

"
"

  GOT FRUSTRATED FOR THIS USES, WHEN I AM VISIT THE SHOWROOM THEY SAID, ITS MY MISTAKE. I DONT KNOW WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM IN MY PHONE AND HANDOVER THE DEVICE TO SHOWROOM, THEY NEED TWO DAYS TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE. THEN WHY WE GOING TO BRAND LIKE ONEPLUS. TOTALLY UNHAPPY WITH MY PHONE. DONT GO THIS MOBILE

"
"

  Super phone camera is good and it is working so smooth it is my first one plus phone and good one and value for money camera quality is so nice finger print sensor is amazing and the face unlock is also soo fast and the battery life is super

"
"

  I was using OnePlus 6 and switched to Nord. Nord is sleeker than OnePlus 6. Has improved features. It's been three days since i started using the product. It's amazing so far. The migration was seamless.

"
"

  Very good performance & battery life, value for money product. Tad disappointed with camera as pictures are more saturated & selfie has beauty enhanced pics despite turning it off, camera can be categorised as decent for price point overall experience has been great.

  ¬†brought a 1plus nord,I have a issue with the contact number sharing  in  sms.the issue is sending  contact number is going to mms but I want sms.(typing message is sending but sharing contact sms not going) so please solve my problem as soon as possible

"
"

  Overall a good performance is delivered by this phone..90hz,Oxygen os and Amoled display make the experience smoothCamera is okay for this price rangeJust a bit disappointed by the battery drainage although the charging is fast

"
"

  I am in love with this phone.

"
"

  Not so worth it for its price bracket..... Display isn't very satisfying.... Seems more like an LCD with high brightness...... Over the phone is good..... But would appreciate if the price was 2k less than the original price.... Cause its its a bit expensive for the specs they provide

"
"

  Finger print reader is good but at times takes some time to just detect and unlock the phone. It is not as fast as I expected. Same goes with battery life, and camera quality is good in this budget. Overall Nord can be recommended as it has nice features other than these.

"
"

  The phone is pretty awesome. However, my phone with 4k 60fps selfie recording is not working.Whenever I am trying to switch to 4k 60fps selfie recording, camera crashes. Need some leads

"
"

  This is my second buy from OnePlus and i feel that the fingerprint scanner is bit slow, battery is long lasting and the wrap charger does a full charge in one hour, Camera quality is good but not best other one plus phones have better quality than nord, otherwise i feel satisfied with this phone.

"
"

  I am very impressed for this device.The smoothness of this mobile is very impressive.I almost like all of its feature.It is a great mid range mobile phone with 5g.Only one problem for the Gamer is battery drainage problem and for those who are not addicted to game it is a very great product

"
"

  I loved this phone. But I have facing a purple colour tinting issue on my display. It's make more irritation for me while using in dark mode. And I am realized that I can't go with this issue because I am a die-hard fan of Dark mode. And iam going to replace this one bcs I loved OnePlus oxygen Os

"
"

  The volume buttons should have been placed a little higher because while switching on both fingers are touching both sides and frequently I get screenshots without requiring them. Other parameters like battery life, quick charging, camera quality are all good.

"
"

  The phone you all need

"
"

  If you are concerned with battery life, this phone is not for you. Otherwise everything is perfect. No heating issue, camera quality is fine, speed of phone is awesome, premium look, very handy.One cocern with delivery- even though I am prime member, delivery took 5 days.

"
"

  Not a good product from one plus less processor less graphic on pubg very disappoint from oneplus

"
"

  Not satisfied with quality of photo it captures  Samsung M31 takes good pictures then this which is half price of Nord  I brought this phone special for its camera and the big screen. But display is also not gives that much quality result

"
"

  Great phone at this price....the best thing i like about the phone is the 90hz refresh rate.the screen feels so smooth.all these feauture at this price range that a big wowww.

"
"

  This is my first one plus model.... Price vs.  performance is really not comparable... With this price u get far far better mobiles with better features...  In fact my old samsung is far far better... I think this is my first and last one plus... I will ever buy one plus

"
"

  review after use of one month,Now the device is working fine in other Feature, but the main issue I have got with this device isNETWORK ISSUE, many times my network got stuck in this time I'm not getting any call or SMSI have to restart the device all the time to make it in use.

"
"

  Pretty good product except camera. Camera is good but not enough that hype they given initially before launch.Display is super smooth, battery is good it charge 60% for 30 minsFinger print scanner awesome speedAnd I got mobile few days back and I doesn't have any display issues

"
"

  Really Oneplus ? Is this type of product you deliver ? Battery is getting fully drained in just 2hours ? Is Battery is duplicate or the mobile or making people fool is your business. TBH very disappointed with product. Hope you will fix Battery drain issue in upcoming major software update ASAP.

"
"

  Very Fast Refresh RateCamera was GoodBattery charging powerfully red cable dart chargingStylish LookSmooth WorkingClassy ProductDnt Confused people Just Go For It.Oxygen Ios765G ProcessorAwesome

"
"

  The only con i found is the bluetooth disconnection on 2.4 Ghz wifi but they've pushed an update for the same . Other than that issues like then screen tint or black bar thing both of these are present tbh but i highly doubt you'll ever notice them . Overall it's a satisfying phone.

"
"

  Worth the wait and alos the money. I had seen a lot of videos stating that they've received the product with display issues. I have not experienced any such issues. Really good product and I would say one of the best in this price range.

"
"

  I will stop buying any product from Amazon it is making fool by addding only replacement plan below . Beaware before buying if you are not happy with device you can't return . Stupid !!!

"
"

  The brightness of phone is very poor.. in hot sunlight.. I'm not able view screen at all.. other things I found good.. only the issue is with phone brightness.. atleast in daylight something should be visible.. it been week since I got OnePlus Nord. If this could be fixed updates then no issues

"
"

  Best price phone ....don't go for realme, mi , oppo , vivo 30k range phones, I used most of them, no one can reach this level of ONE PLUS.

"
"

  Very much satisfied with all the excellent work by OnePlus. This is my first OnePlus mobile and I like it very much. Value for money

"
"

  One plus nord is very beautiful.I'm excited this one plus nord. I'm very happy Today. I'm pre ordered this mobile 28th July and delivery today 16th August. delivery is too late.

"
"

  Pls don't buy OnePlus device, totally lagging issues, poor battery performance, not upto bench mark, 30k waste for this device if you buy this.

"
"

  Bad camera front and rear ,in low light conditionsCamera defeats with any other phone under 25k, overall performance is good,battery life is good,But Charging is little bit slow,phone built qualitySeems good.

"
"

  Over all 3 üåüCamera aur batter  ho sakta haBil quality inko metal ka Dena chahie thaAgar 3.5 mm jack nahin diya gaya hai kam se kam Inko 3.5 mm Jack adaptors provide karna chahie thaLekin Inka Oxygen os  lajawab ha mobile ka ek alag fil deta hai

"
"

  Definitely love the hand feel of the phone, good software, good hardware but don't get high for camera quality,the camera really suffers in harsh lighting condition.pubg runs smoothly no frame drops till now.overall a promising phone,due to oxygen OS we can hope for better update in the future

"
"

  There is nothing to not like about this. It has everything. Dont compare camera quality to the 50K phones as this is a mid segment one. Works like a charm!

"
"

  I like the product but I am little disappointed with the camera quality. As the hype was created for camera but in reality it's not that good.

"
"

  Phone doesn't reach expectations at all. Battery is very good though. Back glass is very weak. Back glass broke on slight pressure. Camera is good but expected to be better. Fingerprint sensor is slow. Face unlock is better. Overall the phone is not worth its price range.

"
"

  Today is my first day, phone is awesome no issues, as today is 1st day so not used too much but as used for 2 or 3 hours, phn is very good, all things r very smooth, camera is awesome, finger print is working smooth at this price range the phone good no doubt, go ahead with this one plus ....

"
"

  phone is good. nothing to worry for daily usage (normal). if you pro photographer or pro gamer it's not for you. you can play games smoothly without lags but in this price phones with better processor are available. i like it very much cz it's having things which i want. and it feels premium.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Everything feature works much better as I expected. The camera really similar to OnePlus 8 camera. Speed is amazing. Battery is amazing. But just one slight cons is the speaker, which doesn't provide a rich sound. There is more treble than bass.

"
"

  Pre booked through Amazon and delivered promptly as per schedule. Good phone from one plus sold on Amazon with good packing and safe delivery

"
"

  My one plus nord purchsed.last day showing darker colours to the right side of screen.. predominantly shown in dark mode..seen in whatspp, insta ,youtube also,more bright towards left side of screen and going right at the rightmost end it becoms dark..Any knowledge on this?

"
"

  I wish battery would last a bit more but it's fine it lasted the whole day under heavy usage giving me more than 10% at the end of the day the best thing is that it has 30w warp charging which charges it up pretty fast over all the phone is a bang for the buck it is a bang for the buck

"
"

  It is claimed that the phone can be charged upto 70 in 30 minutes but mine is not able to charge even 50. It is taking almost 1.25 hrs to charge from 20 to 90. Also the battery life is not so good, you have to charge it twice a day if you do little gaming also but overall it's a good device.

"
"

  The first one plus phone in this range. Camera is decent and working good so far. Value for money but no headphone jack is a setback. You have to purchase bluetooth headphones, and also my home theater system (that's not bluetooth enabled) is useless with this phone.

"
"

  Absolutely Perfect for gaming and photography everything is perfect in this phone but OnePlus charging promises is fakeüòÇ it tooks 45 min. to charge 70% and in 1hr10min fully charged

"
"

  This phone has good battery backup and charges very quickly.Camera quality is good at light. For low light or indoor photo it's okay. For night photography camera has a option which is good. Performance is good at this cost. Finger print sensor is quite impressive and fast

"
"

  Fantastic display....and hands-on screen look and feel is nice.....Good camera (selfie camera is ok ok).... Not so bad battery back-up....fast charging...no heat issues...12gb ram...256 internal storage.....fits well in your hand....what else do you want....with 30k price...üôåüíØ

"
"

  For this price...., I'm satisfied...But I've expected more for this camera...

"
"

  Good 5G phone at best price

"
"

  good product

"
"

  Absolutely buggy mobile in all aspects,Just a marketing tactics nothing works well with the mobile.Not recommended.1. Poor battery backup2. Poor browsing speed3. Apps keep getting crashed and shows not connected to internet and4. Poor multitasking

"
"

  Being oneplus brand, phone is too costly for this specs. Phone is fast but not as other oneplus device. Marble blue color is good. If u r planning to buy without offer or exchange then don't go for it. Instead of this invest a little amount on oneplus 7T.

"
"

  The over all performance is okRegarding camera 48 mp doesn't have zoomProcessor speed is satisfactoryOtg/adapter not suppliedScreen lay out not attractiveThemes are very lessCustomization not so user friendly

"
"

  Good Phone but price is high for this spec. I went for brand and spec but not upto the expectation.. Especially camera..Facing Signal issues. Suddenly network signal goes off and reconnect suddenly so problem during attending calls.

"
"

  Fast fingerprint readerNice battery lifeGood primary camera qualityRemaining cameras will be improved soon( announced by oneplus officially)Smoothest dispaly

"
"

  Battery backup is very low... disappointed

"
"

  Final opinion : if you are moderate user then go for itPros : smooth touch experience, slim design , better storage , lag and add free OS , warp chargeCons : Camera is just above average but not as expectedBattery life is good for 60Hz but drain faster for 90Hz

"
"

  Everything is fine, but I got this connectivity issue with the deviceThe connectivity like WiFi, Bluetooth and mobile networkWhen we are on call, the whole connectivity all of a sudden disconnects and reconnects backI hope this issue gets resolved quickly

"
"

  Display and photo having green tint, when you take a photo at night without flash a dark pink color is evident. You wont get a black dark color.

"
"

  The screen has a green- pink tint which absolutely makes it look very cheap. I have attached a picture that I took on the phone with 48MP camera. I absolutely hate the pictures. I was using a 15K Redmi phone before this. That phone has a far better camera. DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  I have used one plus 6 , one plus 7 pro but this is by far best. In terms of quality , weight , ergonomics - loved it.

"
"

  I received this phone on 23 August and I am facing internet issues...I used to use same sim in my another one plus phones and in that it was working fineAnd I just saw on Google that many of other nord users also facing same issues

"
"

  Wrost product. Sounds quality poor. Heating too much . Camera result dull. Nothing is working properly . No return policy available after receiving phone. Wrost service department.

"
"

  After a weekusage I realised that I finally found a best phone in recent in low budget under 25kGood camera,smoothness,performance everything was superb best phone must tryüòò

"
"

  Worst cameraHave focus problemsMacro mode is totally uselessOnly primary camera performs average and in low light condition it also fails to satisfy usIf you are a camera oriented person better go for other alternatives  Thank You

"
"

  Good Phone in this budget.Great Camera Quality, specially wide angle mode have great stabilization in video.Not much heavy. We haven't observed any screen flickering issue or low light issue. It's same as OnePlus7.Only con is two front camera takes space from screen

"
"

  Camera quality is not upto the mark as expected battry also drains fast if you are a real game or used to play free fire u can't play in this device becoz of some issue.....overall device is good if you are a normal user then u can go for it otherwise so many options are there go for that.

"
"

  Good decent phone, with good fingerprint reader, battery life and decent bcamera quality, a complete good package for day tovday office useBut no recordibg facility available and few glitches seems to be there in software, which is not expected from one plus.

"
"

  Very good mobile. With best features no hanging bright vision superb camera quality finger lock üîê sounds quality wonderful 10/10

"
"

  This is a brand new phone in the market for a reasonable ptice . Affordable , Sleek and smart looking one. The probmem is with the ear phone as only bluetooth version can be used and that has to be bought separately which costs another 5000 rs. Exorbitant rate for a ear phone.

"
"

  The quality and look is so premium.i loved the glass back.nord blue is super excellent and its so excellent than in the photos.camera is also good but not that of oneplus 8.finger print is so fast.its so accurate for value for money

"
"

  ProsGood cameraGood soundGood displayGood performanceFinger print sensorConsBattery life

"
"

  People who like dark themes should beware that OnePlus Nord has tint issues. I thought it wouldn't be a big problem but it definitely looks something like a damaged product in low brightness. The overall specs are decent but for a phone this price one should not expect any display issues.

"
"

  The bad thing about oneplus nord is that when you wants to record someone's call , it will say your call will be recorded. The other person will come to know that you will be recording the call.I advice oneplus to bring latest update and remove this automatic call recording message.

"
"

  Battery discharges rapidly using 90hz. If you are using this phone for multiple apps and continuous calling, texting or video calling, it is one of the best phone to use. Camera is also good. Only issue is the battery but due to warp charging it can be manageable.

"
"

  Phone is pretty decent look wise. Battery drains slightly faster and to prolong battery life one has to keep it in battery saver mode most of the time. Camera works good except for low light photo. UI is very good and finger print works smoothly. Given the price a decent buy.

"
"

  Cons-Camera is ok-ok.Call drops initially when calling (hope s/w update fixes this)Battery drains way too fast (4 hr screen on time)Pros-In hand feel is amazing, nice materials.Oxygen Os is very responsive and clean.

"
"

  This phone is the best of allFirst of all the camera is greatest. You can't ignore taking pics from it. The fingerprint scanner is very smooth. The battery life is awesome and it takes just one and a half hour to full charge with its own adaptor.

"
"

  Finger print sensor isn't that great. The camera is good. I order 128gb so no storage issues. Too smooth to handle. Happy shopping.

"
"

  Very handy and comfortable to hold in the hands.Battery life is ok,it stays for 12 hrs once charged(for me).I did not find the display green tint issues.The Blue marble color is awesome.And also u get regular updates from OnePlus which makes ur phone more better.

"
"

  Pros:Battery lifeSpeedPriceRegular OS updatesCons:Slow fingerprint sensorCamera quality not upto the markPhone is a bit heavy

"
"

  I am using this phone from a month ago everything is going good sometimes I found the hitting problem while charging the phone otherwise this phone is amazing in this price range .

"
"

  Nord is excellent phone in terms of speed, display, software experience. However camera is just average. Don't buy this phone is you are looking for great camera. Also buy 12GB RAM variant as it gives you smooth experience. But disappointed with camera setup, use of gcam is recommended.

"
"

  It is not as best as said by themIt is just as normal as remaining ones,They said cam is equal to OnePlus 8But it didn't. The 48 mp camera while taking pic with flash on indoor it takes much time to processAnd there is no zoom with 48 mp camThe 12 mp cam is just good,

"
"

  Worthy purchase

"
"

  Going truly back to the roots! Anyone who started thier journey when they Oneplus One will truly appreciate this beauty. Premium, elegant and smooth. The Never Settle experience!

"
"

  Device is amazing as it is OnePlus phone but I think price is costly as compared to camera but this is what you get for what you pay....go for it good phone with good price but so much hypes lol and Amazon should improve their delivery as I have received my product very late very very late..

"
"

  smooth as butter

"
"

  Good mobile good product battery life excellent & fast charging is amazing üëçüëå

"
"

  prosoxygen os,smoothness while handling,12gb ram,video quality,face lock is super fastconscamera is worst,battery sucks,fingerlock take times.no tint issue for me

"
"

  Such a good phone in this price range segmentCamera quality is unmatched. Battery is fabulous. Easily lasts a day after heavy gaming use. Design is the best feature of this.

"
"

  Camera quality - Average (same as other mid-range devices like poco x2)Battery life - 5:30 Screen on timePerformance - Good but not for gaming.Screen - Good but too bright in dark and little green tint issue on my model.Conclusion - Overpriced

"
"

  Camera is pathetic... Battery life is average... Design id ok...Not at all justifies the price.

"
"

  Within a month of buying this, I have developed a problem where I cannot answer phone calls, one plus site or service is not being helpful. I never had issues with my BlackBerry.

"
"

  The phone looks really awesome the material is obviously not cheap oneplus has done a great work in this price and the color is eye catching

"
"

  Display is amazing along with the finger print lock and face lock. The camera is awesome in bright light but in low light its equally bad. The phone is really fast but 90hz refresh rate but i experienced some lag while using multiple apps.overall it seems like a good deal to me.

"
"

  I was using One plus 6. I am ok ok with this phone. camera quality is not so good because it doesn't seem like to be an original photo similar to one plus 6.Performance is little slower than one plus 6 because of the processor.Takes time to open appsllications.

"
"

  Best phone under 30K price segment..üôåIt is a all round and versatile device. You get flagship experience of oxygen OS, the 90 Hz refresh rate fells buttery smooth, the camera is decentish. It is a phone you can flaunt at an fairly good price.

"
"

  Awesome mobile üëç camera üì∏ quality is excellent and its resolution is of 4kFastest technologySuper fast charging 70% in 30 minBest in one of one plus mobiles

"
"

  Super fast processor, great ram management, camera is also great, look and color of the mobile is very beautiful, display quality is awesome, 5g ready for future use, overall great product. I'm 200% satisfied.

"
"

  When I on Wifi and Bluetooth simultaneously then Bluetooth doesn't work. It gets auto closed.And when I on my gps location then also Bluetooth is giving problem, it gets auto closes. Pls let me know how can I fix this issue. Thanks.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is awesome. Battery life is good .Overall very nice product in this price range with 5G compatible.

"
"

  Phone is fantastic. It is a premium experience giving phone. Go for it. Dont wait for overpriced 8 or upcoming 8T.I loved this phone.I don't want to type much about all the specs..But one phrase sums it all""Totally worth it""

"
"

  ProsBattey life was good.Screen display was so nice and the screen refresh rate was amazing.No tint issue till nowzen mode was amazingConsType c ear phones are not supportedAR CAMERA was not there and zooming also not there.

"
"

  Nord performance is nice, Amazon delivered on schedule day but battery is big problem, drain in 8 hours till evening and switch off as I was not carried C type cable.

"
"

  I am big fan of OnePlus still am using OnePlus2 mobile, after buying nord very disappoint abt camera. Please don't buy it. Camera quantity is very bad, worst..Phone performance is ok. But I am very disappointed about camera quantity. Not worth for money.

"
"

  Great

"
"

  Amazing product. As people were talking about some issues but I didn't find any issue with One plus nord. This phone is superb. Good camera, battery life and best performance.

"
"

  Nice product üëçPrimium feelingAwasomeBut rear camera üì∏ (mainly deept camera is totally unvernable throw it!)3jack is not available.If 3jack pin for earphone is happen than this is one of the best phone .....üòÄüòÄ

"
"

  As per the brand oneplus the phone is very good in terms of software experience,camera not perfect too but good enough but there is some system lag while using 3rd party app due to aggregation of cache file oneplus should need to recover this out soon with their update .

"
"

  This my first oneplus mobile.I was using Note 6 pro before.My WOW experience is for Camera, Apps opeing speed and user friendliness.Phone generates heat more than normal which is not expected from Oneplus.Overall mid level experience you will get from this phone I guess.

"
"

  Apart form indoor photos everything works great but when it comes to indoor photography this camera setup doesn't comes great this is the only reason of 4 start otherwise its a perfectly balanced phone main pros: Oxygen OS & 90hz display

"
"

  cant see better then this.. oneplus name is enough to discribe.. dnn wry abt camera.. its really gud.. great results.. display.. 12/10.. bettry capacity nd charging awsm.. its a dream phone.. must buy if u want more then perfect phone. nothing to compromise..

"
"

  I m using this phone since 2 months and I haven't found any issues regarding camera battery or any thing... Its really amazing and very Handy product

"
"

  One plus Nord is not worthy phone , Automatically factory reseting in poket , I lost my data, please don't buy. OnePlus cheating the there customers.

"
"

  Don't but this product becoz after one day of delivery of phone having a issue on display with a large line is show somtimes and disappear sudden after unlock the phone so is too bad experience of oneplus with me and bettry is not satisfactory draining so fast can be used just oneday

"
"

  Video Recording More Than 10Min Counties Then Mobile Gets Heated And Flash Gets Disabled

"
"

  First gameing is worst...free fire is not working properly..Bluetooth is not working..the device not connecting to real me earbuds.I am trying to return the device..they are not accepting...worst experience.. kindly go for resmi k20 pro in this price range..

"
"

  Pretty much satisfied with the smooth functioning of OnePlus Nord and it is one of best smartphone in this budget. Camera is exceptional and so is the fast charging. Lots of hidden feature but some issue while trying to switch off the phone via Power Button.

"
"

  I am totally satisfied with this phone , it is light weight slim and a powerful smartphone, oxygen os is so smooth and snappy and the camera quality is superb ,but battery backup is not good and cahrging speed is mind blowing

"
"

  Im writting this after 30 days of use.. Fast fingerprint reader, Amoled display and camera quality is awesome... I compared One Plus camera with Poco X2 which has 64MP IMX 686.. But it seems One Plus has more saturated colours....but One Plus should have latest flagship processor.

"
"

  Phone is not working after 10 days of deliveryHalf an hour ago I had a talk. Phone did not fell even though it is not working why....Not good quality at allCould not return because of 7 days return policy.One plus you have degraded the quality in Nord

"
"

  Don't Buy  ONEPLUS NORD as it does not breathe same Oxygen OS. It is mixed with Google Apps which doesn't provide important features of Oxygen OS.  It has Google Dialer which doesn't allow automatic call recording and don't have speak caller ID and many more features of Oxygen OS.

"
"

  The whole performance of mobile excellent everything is working in slick way but can you guys please upgrade the camera clarity because the pictures are extraordinary but I need the clarity make my words a bit serious you should improve the clarity the camera in update

"
"

  Oplus nord has software issues phone automatically factory reset becarefullToday morning my phone has factory reset all my data is gone ,most of the users has this issue

"
"

  I loved the Grey Colour it gives a beautiful shine in daylight and looks premium..I liked how the camera works as expectedSpeed is very goodBattery charged in morning at 11 and is 55% with proper work from home usage...Happy with the product ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  The main missing is Dolby audio and other was k display was also little disappointment

"
"

  Battery backup not complete, maximum 3 hours charge is down,then other futures do smooth,and good product, worth id amount

"
"

  It's good phone for a casual user.Not a good battery lifePerformance wise it is goodCamera is decentDisplay is awesome (I didn't face the tint issue) 90hz is goodOxygen OS is the main highlight.

"
"

  OnePlus NordCamera goodDisplay excellentBattery drain quicklyOxygen os is smoothGood productLittle disappointed by battery performanceOverall great product in this price rangeNo display issueNo connectivity issue4.5 star

"
"

  Must buy phone , see if you are searching for a good daily driver then this phone is for you also the gaming is pretty smooth,camera quality is awesome,best battery life,charge within 55mins, display is wonderfull.

"
"

  Unique Fingerprint Sensor in this model with a lot of features, i really loved this model.A little bit unsatisfied with battery backupOverall Good Model...Specially thanks to the Assemble of INDIA

"
"

  Overall phone is worth for money .. display and camera quality is very good..... But speaker quality should be more better which we expect from OnePlus....

"
"

  Worst Mobile. Display Blinking Problem. Suddenly Brightness Decreasing. Fingerprint Not working Properly. Don't Buy OnePlus Nord. My Previous Mobile OnePlus 3 100% Better than this mobile.

"
"

  The phone is good doesn't heat or no tints or any screen defects in my unit, so far very good although i feel like touch isn't that responsive but helps the job done, and cameras are the worst part of the device if u do take more photos this phone is not for you sucks in camera.

"
"

  Excellent mid range phone , this is my 4 th one plus device. Best phone in this price range , camera needs improvement.

"
"

  Mobile was super , everything is good, battery backup problem ,waste of money ,don't buy this mobile ,main problem battery backup,, camera clarity is almost gud,fast finger print not work ,long press finger print ,so OnePlus all series ok,nord is very bad experience

"
"

  I bought it after seeing various positive and negative reviews on social media, but I do not see any of the issues mentioned in this phone.I really liked this phone.

"
"

  Worst phone . Please don't go for it. Camera has the worst picture quality. I gifted this to my sister and it was the biggest mistake.Battery drain so fast.If u want a camera phone don't even think of buying this phone. Nord my a$$

"
"

  I'm looking for solutions to solve camera issues in snapchat and Instagram filters. This phone is not well optimised for social media apps. Photos looks very unatural while clicking and Ads also look pixelated. Screen cast stops unexpectedly. Going to return if problem persist.

"
"

  This is one of the best budget flagship phones that is currently available in the Market.Performance is quite good. Camera could have been a little better. But it's worth the money.

"
"

  Performance is smoothIt does seem that the phone has mid range processor.It is better than samsung 2 years old flagshipsFast charging is commendableUnlike in other phones Charing constant with speed

"
"

  this phone is perfect for me. it has everything which I need on my phone. Solid Battery Charging and Battery Life System.

"
"

  Premium feel and higher screen refresh rate resulting in great display. Recently rolled out updates have given more stability to the camera

"
"

  Battery is running out speedly.Some apps features are not working ex: camera zoom in snapchat app etc...Final veradict : Not upto the mark

"
"

  Fentastic for a basic user. No ads non sense . Smooth android os n user interface is awesome. Camera okay okay. No heating issues at all. Delivery was quick arrived before the date.. Exchange facility was smooth.

"
"

  This is really osm phone. good finger prints scanner and good build quality. nice in hand felling main camera is good another 2 camera is ok ok super fast 90Hz refresh rate panel full HD screen and our all phone is osm i love this oxigen os and One plus brand......

"
"

  It's showing 12 mp and 48 mp but worrest photography

"
"

  Am a one plus 7 user I love, one plus series so I decide buy one plus Nord problem starts first day battery very poor if I charged full charge after half hour without using battery drain 30% about so every day same problem so I decide return the phone I was really disappointed

"
"

  I found the color very attractive, though there is an air bubble in the back body of the phone, I raised a replacement and the technician visited me the very next day. The phone will be replaced within 4-5 days says him. I would like to thank Amazon for their prompt service.üòä

"
"

  I like the phones overall function like it's ever fast snapdragon765 OS,gigantic 12 GB ram,spacious 256gb ROM,fast n clear lightning camera and super fast internet.I dislike this phone just because it doesn't have aux jack supported provision hole for playing music and others.

  The phone is very smooth to use and the charging is very fast. But little bit disappointed in the case of camera, its depth sensor camera does become useful. Overall its a good phone. Comparing to other branded phones, oneplus is so fast and smooth to use due to its Oxygen OS.

"
"

  ¬†Very Good mobile awesome Camera, lovely and smooth displayI'm happy with its Performance....

"
"

  Smooth as ever because of the 90Hz refresh rate and the processor is also great. Switching apps is very fast and the performance is great.

"
"

  Battery drain fast and not a good camera. Softwere problem when playing prime video. Automatic hide front camera but in setting is full display option selected.

"
"

  Best phone in the price range...many are comparing nord with 40k plus range phones...thats the main problem of degrade...nord gives you get good processor, display and other good features and camera performance is good....definitely this is the best in below 30k...

"
"

  It is not something like worth for money in 30k I was expecting something premium class mobile but it is the same as like oppo Poco realme MI redmi CEO so don't waste money putting 30k. Real MI 7 aur poco instead of I feel regret now I would have bought pixel4a or apple basic

"
"

  Its a nice product from one plus i don't know why people are giving negative reviews. Overall i love the product and as well as its camera quality.The only negative thing i found it that tint effect ..that is for real..The picture is clicked from oneplus nord only

"
"

  Most like things is body design but not fingers prent resistance

"
"

  One plus Nord is an awesome product available in this price range. Its touch is so smooth. Battery is getting low fast. But the it charges at a great speed. Camera is good except the macro lens need to be improved. There's no lag while using the phone.

"
"

  Everything is good but i literally see the tint different in call dial or in Google messenger and it is be visible only in medium black, Other than that this phone is lit

"
"

  Didn't expect this kind of nature from One Plus.... Totally disappointed with the camera and battery life...I would recommend people not to go for this one..If you spend half of the amount in other phone( Mi Realme and samsun) you will get much better than this..

"
"

  Well to be very Frank mobile is good in terms of performance smooth UI battery is pretty decent.Camera not up to d mark.There is bit luggish on when u open google photo.Definitely not for heavy users.

"
"

  On day one .there is an issue on calling screen when we are putting call on speaker/mute ,whole screen is refreshing . I can see blinking on the screen not sure in future how it will work. very disappointed :(

"
"

  I loved using this mobile. Such a awesome software which provides many customisations.Its a complete alrounder

"
"

  I am trying to get used to the software. But all three, camera, battery and finger print reader are took. Sleek, less weight.

"
"

  Nice device , best phone which launch one plus in this price sigment absolutely nice all about it best camera , performance, fingerprint, etc ..... Charger is also best.

"
"

  This is worth for 30k and the beast in its segment ,the main question is will we get benefits for pre ordering I have pre ordered on July 15th ,still didn get any info from Amazon for the pre ordering benefits

"
"

  Finger print is too fast n accurate it works on apps too...50min battery will be charged 100% it gives excellent battery life wen v cm to camera its too good n excellent on potriot and 48mp lens gives u a very good photos n videos v cn record video upto 4k 60fps n 30fps too

"
"

  After the recent software updates...phone camera quality is much improved than before. Fingerprint reader is quick.. battery life average..one day usage for normal users

"
"

  Superb experience with camera, design and color of the phone and sound is also good with quite handy phone, nice can buy worth for it.

"
"

  Great phone from oneplusüòçIn display fingerprint working perfect ‚úîBattery life awesome ‚úîFast charging working smooth ‚úîDisplay butter smooth ‚úîCamera perfect üî•For daily usage anyone can blindly go for oneplus nord ‚úî

"
"

  The phone is amazing. Works pretty smooth and battery life is also good. 30W fast charger charge the phone from 0%-27% in around 10 min.

"
"

  1. Oneplus Nord camera quality is very very bad.2. Picture is too blurry. Even mobiles for 15,000 rupees will get good clear photos.3. It's completely waste of money.My suggestion is not to buy this mobile. It's completly waste of money.

"
"

  If there is no display issue its a better choice. Really comfortable to use. Good battery durability. No heating issue.. If the display issue cleared its a better choice... I think its software issue , i got this issue after my last update before that there is no issues...

"
"

  Very Smooth To Use With A Great Oxygen OS and 90Hz Refresh Rate.Battery Life Is A Concern As It Drains Faster With 90Hz Refresh Rate So You Have To Charge It Twice A Day But Warp Charge is Very Quick and it takes just about 1 hour and 10 minutes to get fully charged.

"
"

  I was really scared at first because this was my first time to order a phone online but I am amazed it was just impact no harm was done to phone. Also, camera quality is amazing but battery life is not that good . I love the purchase no problems occured yet . Thanks Amazon

"
"

  Very bad, I am very disappointed about one plus brandThe phone is automatically restart and automatically erase all data after 15 daysDaily routine of mobile

"
"

  The phone is amazing ...I have been using the phone for almost a month ...the speed is amazing as well as the charging ....camera is good not great ....battery lasts a whole day ...I was using a phone which was five years old so the nord was an amazing upgrade

"
"

  It's little bit heating problem while using the phone for short period of time..and it battery performance is good and camera quality is good ..at this budget phone is relevant but heating problem is getting so please check it why it's heating problem coming..

"
"

  OnePlus 1st time user , Super product with  features, camera good, OnePlusNord‚ô•Ô∏è

"
"

  The camera quality is extremely worst of both front and rear.It doesn't justify the price...very worst quality camera. Cameras are only for numbers just for counting.

"
"

  Front camera clarity was terrible. A 10k phone would have better camera.After using one plus 5, I kinda hate taking pictures in this.

"
"

  I don't like this product. This is worst mobile. The battery back up is worst. When you full charge 100 percent mobile then it will give back only for 9 hours. I am very disappointed. Please don't buy this product and I have also suggested my friends and family don't buy.

"
"

  camera clarity best, Ram speed is best.

"
"

  Battery backup not upto the mark over all good

"
"

  Poor battery backup, it doesnt last a day, drains very fast. Camera average.Unnecessary hype given to this phone

"
"

  not good phine very high price ramge thia phone  other company very low price in this feature mobile

"
"

  Value for money!

"
"

  Very very pathetic mobile I have ever seen. Worst than 12k mobiles.Major issues am facing:1.Hanging while calling- very very irritating, I think my 4 year old phone won't hang this muchüò°2.Touch pad is not3.While typing text it acts very sensitive

"
"

  Superb,Delay delivery very log time to deleverd but product very fantastic this phone tq one plus üòç pre order but delivery releted issue so plz fast delivery next time

"
"

  I am using this phone from past 1 month and yes apart from battery it is very smooth as it runs on oxygen os

"
"

  Battery life is not that good as compared to other OnePlus phones.Camera quality must be improved.No sensors in phoneWrost experience with OnePlus.

"
"

  Everything is perfect daylight camera awesome.. overall experience goodFingerprint reader is fastBattery life Normal and camera quality in daylight is great

"
"

  Camera quality superbFront cam also goodGood Battery lifeSuperb Warp chargingFinger print is little bit slow

"
"

  1)Voilent shaking may cause blurry photo this message continuously display whnever u open camera or click photo which is annoyying2)don't provide any eye protection continuously watching some video effect ur eyes mostlyOther overall performance is quite good

"
"

  Camera quality was not good.Sound quality also not as expected.Please please before buying read description.Because it doesn't have a return option only a replacement option available that is also if you have any issues on your phone.

"
"

  Good mid range mobile phone this corana  year Camera and finger print software battery life  good fully one day morning 7am to around night 12pm long life battary I am writing ofter 1and half month on purchase I like awesome mobile phone 12gb and 256 memory,

"
"

  Superb delivery by Amazon, Hats off.. mobile is too good, very smooth screen, fast, nice camera, overall awesome experience with my first one plus..

"
"

  Dispalay and speed is awesome, little issue with the battery as gets discharged but with 30 watt charger you can charge from 0 to 100 in 75 mins. Little heating issue is also there with continuous use but I would say Excellent phone in this range. You will never regret.

"
"

  Very good phoneCamera has no issuesCharging is very fastBattery is goodLittle smaller than I expectedOnePlus switch help to recover old phone data

"
"

  Display is great ! (90 hz refresh rate is really fast and responsive)Battery life is good, warp charger is amazingly fast.Notch is a little bit annoyingCamera is satisfactory, not amazing.Overall 8/10.

"
"

  If you love to watch content & won't play heavy game it's perfect for you, but i have found the green tint issue on my mobile tbh & camera is avarage i expect Betyer from OnePlus hopefully they will fixed it with next update.

"
"

  I have blue marble 8 - 128 varient, camera quality is not so good better than some mid-range phones, overall experience is good, but I purchased for camera - photos, video purpose, but this is not good in the field of camera.

"
"

  Doesn't feel like a one plus phone , Poor battery life , poor camera , lot many other issues. I am a one plus fan as in my family all other phones are one plus but this one is not the phone I expected from ONE plus.

"
"

  RAM is 12gb but working as 6gb. Not refer to buy this phone.Now days Amazon service is also very bad. even refund amount is getting delayed.

"
"

  Have been using this for more than a month now. Great display, decent battery life..around 7-8 hrs of screen on time. Good camera..can capture some really great pictures and the cherry on the top is the OnePlus oxygen os. No issues faced till now

"
"

  Getting disturbance while receiving incoming calls which is truly shocking for one plus standard. Not able to hear the incoming voice. Totally disappointed since my return time also expired on 16/09. I don't know what to do & to whom to complain.

"
"

  Worst one plus device I ever bought. Totally disappointed. There are lots of issue with charging and phone is getting hanged multiple times

"
"

  The screen quality is not fully satisfied.Its showing some yellowish color always I've tried everything but nothing happened. Otherwise all good with the phone. Amazing phone

"
"

  Wonderful phone..My first oneplus mobileWorth the money

"
"

  Best mid range processorGoodFast charging 30W90hz displayRegular updates12 256 at this priceConsMono speakerBetter camera optimization

"
"

  It hangs and has to be restarted again and againBattery life is lessRest all good about phone

"
"

  Overall worth purchase. Was using 1+5t and this brought more freshness. 90hz dispaly is smooth to use. 12+256gb good at this price range.

"
"

  Voice is breaking when receiving voice during the calls..I checked in my other phone and it's good ..however Nord has a problem over voice clarity. whats the point of buying a phone which doesnt satsify the basic need i.e. voice clarity.

"
"

  The battery life on Nord sucks!! Very bad.. I get an SOT of only 4 hours to 4.5 hours max. There are also heating issues and front camera shutter lag. Don't buy Nord.

"
"

  Fast charging, very good battery life and nice display. It‚Äôs a good mobile. Value for money.

"
"

  After 3 month, phone is fabulous, but some time its lag.. But not issue i m happy with experience..

"
"

  It's really good phone , everything is awesome. Impressive performance , carmera is great , light weight, easy to handle , colour is awesome ,Good phone under 30k.

"
"

  Battery life very bed.In 24 hours 3-4 time charge required.Fully charged work 4-5 hours only.Network problem is also.

"
"

  Please do not buy this product..immediately after the return window is closed, the phone turned non-functional....what shall I do now?  I have gifted this product and lost all credibility of that gift and now cut a sorry figure for gifting a very poor product.

"
"

  OnePlus Nord phone display is too goodBattery is too goodVery fast chargingPhone good lookingNetwork connection is too goodFront Camera is best back camera not best but not bad aAl over to good

"
"

  The seller Rocket kommerce llp sent the used phone by covering it as new phone..all previously used email logins...saved emails were available on browser...this is totally not acceptable...not worthy to buy with the seller.

"
"

  The only thing that I didn‚Äôt like about this phone was the battery life. After a full 100% charging, it would last for 16-18 hours, whereas the phone would show that two days of battery life was left. Eventually, I ended up returning the phone.

"
"

  Great phone earlier I was using OnePlus 7 pro I felt it's more smoother everything is fine but one problem is that when I connect it to my boats earbuds so it's keep disconnected while talking on call only IDK why. The earbuds didn't have any issue with last phone üòë

"
"

  I purchased this phone for my fiance'..got great feedback from her...best delivery from amazon like always...Now as she has nord, i would have to purchase one plus 8 considering the status factor with oneplus phones.üòÇAmazon please gift me one plus 8...üòõ

"
"

  I am using almost 10 day's everything fine. Video recording is super but camera quality little bit different except all good... Fast charging pubg also running fine..... If any thinking to buy under 30k budget nord is better.... If only u need camera go with vivo v19

"
"

  This a great device for daily usage. The performance is good. Even for gaming it is decent i haven't felt ani lag while playing PUBg.Main camera is the best in the range.Though the macro and depth camera are useless.But still a great device overall.

"
"

  Heating ProblemPerformance is not goodCamera quality is not good

"
"

  My new was 11 days old ...problem was on an onAutomatically switched off...then I will start botton then screen was 1 hours shows the logo... please help me

"
"

  Camera is worst than redmi and realme cames front cam is too worst  battery life is very lessFor this cost is too high better to go for others phones

"
"

  I am first time OnePlus user and nord makes me feel very comfortable because of oxygen os+ amoled display

"
"

  Pros -SoftwareLooksBatteryCons5k worth free gifts for pre-book customers is still not given, no information about it as wellCamera a big let downDisplay brightness out doors is not up to the mark

"
"

  Was scared my unit might have the screen tint issue but thankfully I got a proper one.It's a  good phone for the price.Although oneplus 7 was 32k with sd855And Nord is 28k with sd 765 and plastic frame? OnePlus is changing their motive step by step

"
"

  There is been a colour Shade on my display where I also compared my mobile with other one plus mobile of my friend. So, I found this as my device issue.

"
"

  Great performance, great battery Life. Superb charging speed. Body is good and can be improved. Camera is best in class. Should be made in India.

"
"

  I havr a issue on display......while using mobile ...display was dim and bright ....for few sec ...that was a main issue I faced in this 3days...

"
"

  Honestly, its a very nice phone. Hardware quality is very good. So is the look. But battery is draining fast. It charges quickly, though. Not for travel. Camera is good but sometimes less than expected.

"
"

  The Phone quality looks like a cheap phone not worth the hype created.  The camera needs a lens selection option.  It takes a long time to charge. Pixel 3a  camera works better.

"
"

  In hand feel is great..Camera is very good.Display is best SUPER AMOLED.battery backup is not up to the mark.But overall it is must buy device with good specifications..

"
"

  Superb phone for everything camera, design,look battery life, processor,and last one plus brand. Value for money product.thanks to Amazon for fast delivery.

"
"

  This one is a super hero phone. It does all the job smoothly. Excellent camera, Great processor, smooth transition, decent battery backup and all of it a fast WARP charge which charges ur batter from 19% to 72‚ÑÖ just in 17 minutes. Excellent job sone by one plus. üòé

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is a really great mobile, in terms of specs it's a beast and as a filmmaker, the camera is sooo good to be honest, but battery life is just Fine and it's best in Price segment and most importantly I haven't seen any greentint screen issues.

"
"

  Super annoying pink tint in the display .. heats up even on a normal use like Instagram and WhatsAppBe aware before Yu buy . I don't recommend this phone to anyone. Lost hope on oneplus.Request for return let's see what's Amazon gonna do ...

"
"

  Everything is very nice about this phone, be it the touch sensitivity, response time, battery charging..slim in size and great in hand

"
"

  I have just opened the box seen there is gumming vissible between frame and display

"
"

  great phone , must buy, do not go with bad review. those people really do not understand how to use a flagship

"
"

  Despite not the latest memory used, it has good speed overall

"
"

  GoodThere is no invoice with product, kindly arrange to send to my address.

"
"

  Battery life is decent not that great and camera is not better than my x3 superzoom. Oxygen OS does not mean everything is optimized. OXYGEN OS is trash.

"
"

  EverytimeI buy Oneplus, they amaze me. Oxygen OS is the next best thing to stock Android on Pixel phones. This one wont burn a hole in your pocket but will still deliver top notch quality. Samsung has a lot of catching up to do with Oneplus.

"
"

  I had pre ordered this oneplus nord i hav got the phone bt there is no info abt the second gift box..... Plz update on thy asapThe phones camrea is not as good as my oneplus 7 pro, bt the overall performance is at oneplus flagship levels.... Good job oneplus

"
"

  Everything is AWESOME, but I have got some display issues. The colours are shifting even in white background and with screen brightness even greater than 50%. This part is really annoying. I am applying for a replacement just because this issue is really annoying.

"
"

  The looks, the camera, the display everything is more than what you can expect from a mid-range priced phone.Battery life is satisfactory to me I guess. I am yet to discover the downfall of this phone. Till then a great buy.

"
"

  This is quite expected phone which I really needed it from a long time finally happened this.Thank for wonderful innovation by One+.

"
"

  Overheating in short time, camera not upto mark, display good,  not a great choice for heavy users Finally ok mobile

"
"

  Worst

"
"

  True butter smooth experience. I also bought Nord's 3D tempered glass which is awesome though a bit expensive.Really worth paying for this phone. Also this is my first one from Oneplus. Hoping for good security updates and waiting for OS11.

"
"

  This mobile return not accept..beee carefully.amazon product return not accept.I want OnePlus Nord 12gb ram 256gb storage mobile. But my mobile OnePlus Nord 8gb ram128 gb storage. Amazon return option not accepted..how to return my mobile.. answer me AMAZON

"
"

  Kost of all i like the display quality it's amazing and it's performance is so smooth camera quality is also good  i never expected i will get all the 60,000  phones quality in just 29,999 whenever i look it's buildup quality it's really like some premium phone..

"
"

  It's a nice phone but the front camera is not as expected and the battery life is also average back camera is great and oxygen os is very cool and phone works high end games very smoothly.the display is crisp.

"
"

  Propar note working camera Bluetooth headphones and ishu phone hitting

"
"

  The nord was not good as expected and the camera was also not well as per quality and now the speaker  got damaged when the full volume we keep it get noise and sounds get broken within one month .If u want one plus product go to 8 and more model. Dont buy nord.

"
"

  I have bought one plus nord on 29th of augustAfter 3-4 days problem occured in my celloneSometime my keyboard not opens my return window is also closed what should i doI have complaint about the same before return window but no action has taken

"
"

  First of all I write this review after using this product for two days .Really awesome product from One plus. Battery life is super and lasts for one day. Camera is fine. Performance is highly satisfied. A mid range phone with all the specifications made superb.

"
"

  This smartphone is over hit issue

"
"

  My dream was to buy an Oneplus phone.Fortunate to have been able to order and get one plus nord 12 gb, 256gb onyx grey with excellent features and speed.Thanks Amazon for swift delivery and thanks Oneplus for Oneplus Nord.

"
"

  I have ordered on 07/09 and received on 08/09 ,The camera quality is best in this range.Currently the best phone in market now, sometimes feeling a battery heating issue ,however that is sporadic.

"
"

  Auto call recording option not available so it's serious issue in this price

"
"

  worst product ....network issue....dont buy ..no exchang....no technician support

"
"

  Fingerprint could have been more faster.Live Caption is not at full capacity. It just translates slow and clear English, not rap, fast English, song ones with little lousy music.When compared to YouTube caption it performed 50% of what YouTube gave.

"
"

  The best phone so are in the low budget, amoled display, 90hfz refresh rate it really fast to use, and the camera best in industry. Tank you oneplus

"
"

  Stable performance90Hz AMOLED displayOxygen OS is incomparable at this priceVersatile camera's

"
"

  This is bundle of quality and class. OnePlus stood upto it's standard even after compromising on certain components to price it competitively. The camera and user interface is flawless, which I like the most and made it the best phone at this price.

"
"

  Camera is best in quality sharing few samples. 2mp Micro camera is low performing. You can use separate micro lense which can cost you less than 500 Rs. Battery backup is also good. Overall performance of one Plus nord is good.

"
"

  received the Nord after 14 days. though got a defective product. there is a white smudge in the inner surface of the primary camera lens cover. going for a replacement. dont know when the new set will come.please check your devices carefully

"
"

  Very worst battery backup and heating issue found in this device without battery backup can't use more also one worst future added while taking if have to record the voice callers could be know that voice being recorded my suggestion is do not buy this mobile.

"
"

  This is the best phone under 30,000. It's fingerprint reader is too fast.. It gives more specs than other phones like - realme, redmi, oppo, etc.... One plus nord gives a royal and comfort handset....It proved me that my decision for buying this was perfect...

"
"

  Missing feature it doesn't have auto call recording

"
"

  It's definitely very good phone and having lots of features. I personally like Oxygen OS, it is easy to use and without any bloatware. I have received this phone on the 3rd day of order that too in the early morning.

"
"

  Battery life cud hv been bettr, the faster the charging the more faster it drains, camera is not upto the standards of OnePlus. Sound is good and built is very good. Easy to handle. Ambient sensor cud hv been better.

"
"

  ¬†Its the best in class, by its value..Not dissapointed at all by the product.Just work so smooth.The packing was good.

"
"

  Pros:Premium feel50 min full battery charging time (30 W WARP charge)No laggingPremium touch screen feelCons:Average battery capacity (4115 mAH)Plastic frameAvaerage camera

"
"

  Very attractive product really like it

"
"

  Look wise awesome. Fingerprint and face unlock  response very fast. Sound quality good. Front camera not up to the mark in this price range.

"
"

  The phone is good, hardware is good.. but built is a bit disappointing.. at this price point plastic built of this device makes it look like it is overpriced.. considering other brands offers metallic built

"
"

  Charging bettry is very slow..Camera quality poor 2mp camera is vest..

"
"

  Hell lot of isssues with the phone, blur pictures, ringing voloume is getting low every time, callers voice is dropping and getting low on every call , just got this phone yesterday and so many issues l. This was really unexpected. Please help me immediately.

"
"

  Its a value for money. Its can be a perfect mid range phone for all the youngster like me!

"
"

  There is serious flaw in the One Plus Nord, everyday it is goes switch off during call or working. can I get refund my money I have bought this on 01.08.2020.

"
"

  Just brand name.. doesn't offer anything worth the price...this phone is even costlier in 15k. I am regretting now that I just considered brand name.

"
"

  Battery time is low, although phone at this price is amazing ,back camera is amazing ,but I feel some issue with front camera

"
"

  Dam Dam DamAwesome üëçTouch üíØPerformance üíØFinger print üíØBattery backup üíØSound quality üíØCamera is ok but update quality is more much better..I am really recommended

"
"

  Nord doesn't have automatic call recording, it has google dialer which doesn't support automatic recording and on pressing recording button it gives a clear loud voice prompt saying that your call is being recorded.

"
"

  All things are awesome ,go for it in this price range

"
"

  This is the best midrange OnePlus smart phoneThere is no issue I found till now....even no tint issue. Regular update is given by OnePlus in this smart phone.

"
"

  Camera Quality and other features are really good but battery drain fastly when we play online game. But I can say that if anyone want to buy a mobile in this range then they go for it instead of samsung .

"
"

  I am a long time One plus user.... Happy with the phone looks but expected it little lighter in weight and front camera is more on left side have to be more specific towards the position while taking selfies or talking on video call... Rest m still exploring

"
"

  A average daily driver.. battery performance too average. Pathetic camera performance.dont buy this phone if u considering a good camera phone. A good OPERATING SYSTEM. Clean and bloat free and that's the USP.. POOR AUDIO OUTPUT..it's a single speaker mono..

"
"

  Touch response is not so better, video recording is awesome, camera quality is ok, doesn't not have an 3.5mm audio jack is an major drawback, have to fix some bugs, no heating issues, camera is heading outwards that may damage the upper glass cover of camera

"
"

  Facing purple n green display tint issue üò´.. anyone else is facing this issue ?

"
"

  ¬†I never satisfied with one plus service. First time i buy one plus services and i am totali disappointed with it

"
"

  Nice camara premium quality 1+

"
"

  Performance wise it's gud product but build quality is very delicate.Battery is not as such gud but average.Honestly I will give it 3.5 rating.

"
"

  Best phone but camera is not good struggle lot in low light front camera comes with mirror mode on and u can't turn it off. Shutter speed is very slow it takes 2 second to click a pic. But user experience on UI and daily use is premium

"
"

  This is first time in my life, i ordered onenplus and this is really pathetic phone, please don't buy..battery gait drained so fast, phone is getting heated without using internet..Company is making money but worst customer service...

"
"

  Great.. superb cam quality.. worth for price

"
"

  Really awesome phone and value for money. Everything this is really good. Just one thing that didn't impress me is the camera, mind you the cameras both front and back are good, but not as good as you have expected

"
"

  Touch screen not sensitive, signal quality is very bad, headphones never works properly, I was happy with One plus 1, 3 & 6, Not working properly what do now.

"
"

  Good phone with reasonable price. Using close to a month, so far no call drops, Bluetooth connectivity, battery life issues.

"
"

  Best smart phone on this price segment and the best part about this phone is its camrea and video quality.The only worst part about this phone is its battery performance it not even last for  10hrs a day. Oneplus should do the needful changes on this.

"
"

  Worst phone ever according to this range..Front camera not good because not a steady pics and pics have much noise and distortion. And back camera 48 MP does not have zoom facility... Vibration during calling not so good. Touch sence not so responsive

"
"

  I don't know about the negaative feedbacks but this is the best phone I could ask for the battery is average it last almost a day even after heavy usage . Camera is really good actually macro lens is poor but I don't use those the main camera is really good

"
"

  I wish they have provided type c to 3.5mm converter in the box.Everything else with the phone is topnotch(after using for 2 days).

"
"

  This smart phone's Battery life is average. Battery should be at least 4500 mAh.The display size is average. At least the display size must be 6.55 inch.And storage type should be Ufs 3.0Other functions are very good

"
"

  Camera quality is not good. Phone price is too high better take one plus 7 or 8 if you want one plus experience.

"
"

  I bought this product and am not happy with one plus. One plus Nord is not as expected . Functions are very different from other ONE PLUS mobile's.

"
"

  Good battery backup, amoled display, fast charge.Cons:Main promotion agenda was camera and it's quality just sucks, too much noise in the photos, macro camera is useless.No led indicator for notifications.

  I bought it on 8th this month and the overall performance was good... But the only problem is that the battery drains very fast .  If the phone is also in idle condition also the charge will drain.. So please do something for the better battery performance

"
"

  Camera, storage and speed is the best part of this phone. I got this for my elder daughter and she is really enjoying using this phone. Battery come for 8 to 9 hours max at 70% continuous usage.

"
"

  The phone performance is decent as well as the camera but the battery is worst. Not for gamers..

  THIS  PHONE IS NOT WORTH 28K(Base model)PHONE`S BATTERY DRAINS VERY FASTTHE PRICE RANGE SHOULD BE INBETWEEN 18-20KPHONE`S CAMERA IS AVERAGEONE PLUS IS MINTING MONEY DUE TO 5G LOGO

"
"

  os some time lag while multiple work,No extra edge in camera pictureProcessor do its workBattery life good, screen on time 5:30 hrFull charge in one hour

"
"

  Low light photo quality very poor and micro photo quality very poor

"
"

  Love it for the price, low light Camera is Average but I don't use it much anyway ! Best you can get for the price, I got it for 24800/- for 128GB variant!

"
"

  My experience after 3 months I'm write review .Don't buy This mobile pls. lot's of bug's some games are  not working properly.camera quality average not reach expectations poco realme less price provide nice features

"
"

  Phone having network issue ,network are doing up and down many time phone disconnected during the call I want replace the phone

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is beast but missing Dolby atoms,water resistant etc

"
"

  Value for money but it is draining more percentage of battery for Whatsapp in 90HZ display.Allover the product is good

"

  ProsOxygen osDisplay5gConsProcessor should have been improved for this price(855&above)Camera could have been betterBlue color is more brightIt takes an hour to 100 percentage charge

"
"

  Finger print sensor is very slow, Front camera quality is not Good. Overall Battery life, Rear camera and Performance is good.

"
"

  Phone performance is good and build quality is also good. Camera performance not great. Macro is  useless

"
"

  For 30K, you will not find better phone...

"
"

  Value for money, 12GB/256GB at 30K is no joke, good performance, better battery backup, smooth as silk 90hz with Oxygen OS

"
"

  I am writing this review after using this mobile for 4 days.Delivered with neat packing, Smooth display and good quality, camera quality is nice. After 2 days of usage I received an OS update.Battery is draining quickly

"
"

  its good oneplus phn is reallly awsom go for ittt

"
"

  one plus nord blue marble is such a sexy colourand i personally liked it so much ‚ù§Ô∏èfeatures are pretty good within the budgetno such huge problems with sound quality or charging or pictures üòä

"
"

  It's my first one plus device.It feels good in hand.I got it in appropriate time period.Classy one üíô‚ú®Camera require some updates I think .Overall it's great.I don't face some other issues. I would suggest to buy if you are not a heavy user.

"
"

  Battery life is good, fully charged in 60 min.No hitting issue, No Green tint issue,Performance is also very good.

"
"

  Fingerprint is good,battery life is good,camera quality is medium

"

  Excellent phone by one plus. It's a budget phone. You guys never gonna regret after buying this. It's just awesome.Thankyou one plus for an amazing productAnd thankyou Amazon to deliver it before expecting date as always.....üòòüòò

"
"

  Phone looks very Premium, sleek design, smooth and fast interface and processor, camera quality is good - both front and back, battery runs for full day easily. Satisfied with the purchase completely.

"
"

  The camera quality not reached expectationsIt's just normal.It is over heating in day to day use alsoEven the gaming performance is quite averageIf you like OS of OnePlus it's awesomeDisplay is better

"
"

  Front camera disappointing beauty mode ai overdoing, back camera is great... Battery life is above average so far, still i think value for money..

"
"

  Overall phone is not goodHave many issueApp close automaticallyClick on a photo in gallery and another photo openInternet issuesLow quality coverHeating problem .Overall process is not good enough for UI oxygen

"
"

  The fingerprint sensor didn't work a lot of time and it unlocks slowly. Battery life was not good it drains mero than 5% over the night and gives me the screen on time around 6h from 100-13‚ÑÖ in normal usage(no gameplay, camera usage and video editing).

"
"

  Everythibgs is awesome in the phone. From opening to every features but only thing that the camera is not up to mark. It is taking good pictures but colour are coming so dark and that feeling best is not from camera side otherwide everything is awesome

"
"

  Worth every penny. If you are thinking of buying a smartphone and your budget is on higher end than should definitely go for this phone. One of the best in class. BUY IT IMMEDIATELY.

"
"

  After using 6 days1) camera-3/52) display -5/53)sound- 4/54) battery life-4/55) value for money-5/56) fingerprint reader-5/5Overall a good smartphone in this price rangeI pay 29150 rs for 12/256 verrient.

  It's awesome Phone with 12 GB Ram and 256 GB storage.Very awesome selfie camera and very good back camera and 5G Phone ..it's really awesome Phone

"
"

  Allover phone is good. But battery and front camera should better as my expectations. Both battery life and front camera quality is not good.

"
"

  My google is not opening nd i have to again turn on nd off data too make it work ..i thought it is software issue but after many update also it is not fixed even service centre was not able to detect problm ..its a fail model of oneplus ...

"
"

  Over all good phone in this range nd specially camera quality is too good.Thanks Amazon for delivering these items on time.One thing noticed in this phone is back side The camera is slightly bulging so it is difficult to pocket.

"
"

  Its very slow , specially during reboot . Overall performance is not like 12gb ram .Phone ring is also creating issues , some times is ringing but others time it is not ringing...I have doen all settings ...same phone ring behaviouring like this

"
"

  It is a great phone. I am loving the smoothness of the screen, the camera as well as the other features.I just feel the charging adapter is a little too big, rest all is fine.It looks sleak and nice even without the cover so that's a plus point.

"
"

  The display started acting up (as shown in the photo) after three days of purchase. Have contacted Amazon regarding the issue. Will update review once the issue is resolved.

"
"

  ¬†One of the worst experience form oneplus camera is not opening at allI have preordered the phone nd the camera is not able to runn

"
"

  Excellent Display, Excellent Overall Mobile performance, Excellent battery charging and standby.. Awaiting Camera updates..

"
"

  GUYS PLEASE DON'T BE CHEATED BY THE ONEPLUS BRAND THE MOBILE IS OF VERY CHEAP QUALITY AND FACE UNLOCK OF MOBILE IS VERY VERY SLOW.AND IN THE APPLICATION LIKE WHATSAPP FACEBOOK NEITHER IN ANY APPLICATION U SHOULD APPLY FACE UNLOCK FEATURES.

"
"

  It's not value for money. Not slim, older versions are better.Even one plus 5, 5t are slimmer than Nord.Also precessor is old. Samsung and Mi are providing same specifications with lower prices.Conslusion- Not a good buy!

"
"

  The product is defective. I have complained about it already. There is one more smartphone of the same company, and that product's serial number and IMEI is also same as mine. How can two phones have the same serial number and IMEI number.

"
"

  I am very excited too buy one plus nord but over all this phone is not gud my poco f1 is best then nord even i am working women there is no automatic call recording no music  app after spending 29k i am very very disappointed to this phone

"
"

  After Using for 23 days.Compare to other phone one of my best phone just loved it, performance wise and camara wise best phone.

"
"

  Oneplus nord is truly a budget beast. Loved the amoled 90 Hz screen and oxygen OS was just flawless. Worth every penny. Only flaw is the macro camera. It's just bad. That's all I can say about the camera's flaw. Otherwise, a perfect phone.

"
"

  Biggest problem sometimes goggle is not working, you have to turn off the data and start again.camera is not so good, some frame drop in pubg, battery life is average, overhyped, don't feel premium.

"
"

  Power packed phone, camera is insane and performance is out of the box. I never experienced display tint as im using the phone for 10 days but one problem is the bluetooth stability,it gets disconnected many times . So oneplus needs to fix this asap.

"
"

  Awesome product worth for money excellent camera quality and best and cheapest 5g device and charging ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  I don't see any issues with this phone.... Its awesome üíï only thing is that battery capacity is low and appart from that.. one plus will always rock'.

"
"

  Not met expectation. Bad camera. It look like oppo and vivo . As it's clearly mentioned on box that it's manufactured in OPPO INDIA plant.

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is known for its best in-hand experience & light weight. It's not like other OnePlus flagship product but it's a quite a good option in the midrange segment as compared to its other competitors.

"
"

  Excellent Product!!!Just so very happy with it.Best smartphone i had have ever used!I really couldn't find any cons yet!People should go for it whosoever is looking for a oneplus budget device.Thanks oneplus!

"
"

  I really like this phone. I was using iPhone SE but felt constraint in IOS. I prefer Android.

"
"

  Better to go to samsung M31.It's a mid range smartphone and comes with a massive battery back-up.M31 build quality is also good when compared to oneplus Nord and mainly it's not a Ch*nese product too......Switch to Samsung M31.

"
"

  Battery Quickly drained

"
"

  Battery is not good it's average but it's charger is over powered ao battery doesn't matter alot beacuse it i svery helpfull for me to use mobile  if u wanna olay games u have to keep charger near you cuz it drains so fast although mobile is Amazing

"
"

  It is a nice product of OnePlus. Fingerprint reader is very sensitive and a circular colour around the thumb, looks nice. Battery life is better. Camera is awesome. It has feature to select 1 camera, 2 camera and 3 camera. Overall I like this phone.

"
"

  Hi, The phone gets disconnected after every 5 minutes when on call. I have been trying to reach the Customer service and not been able to. Kindly help in fixing. The phone is just a month old and I did try factory reset still the calls are dropping.

  The product is a marvel.. Amazing specs... really handy.. Camera features are awesome...Good display.. Fast delivery...  loved itüòç One plus nord!!!

"
"

  An awesome phone . The battery goes on for atleast 2 to 2.5 days I am I in tenth so not that much of heavy use but with heavy use the battery will go on for atleast 1.5 days. A killer in the segment a definately one to go gor.

"
"

  Excellent product but camera quality at night is not up to the mark for the price point for which it is been sold

"
"

  The vibration is very weak on the phone. Except that, all seems to be good for now. Also, cannot delete gmail messages from the lock screen, I don't know if that's due to the app or the Oxygen OS.

"
"

  It's waste of money I have recived deficative pic desplay issue last 15 day I am doing follow up with Amazon leadership and escalation team are takeing time.For return my defective pic moble

"
"

  This is my second oneplus earlier I had Oneplus3T, this NORD is hell out of my mind.. Simple awesome on all aspects, I don't have any corns on this for my proselytize. NFC reader is on high level.

"
"

  Such a disgrace to oneplus phone community. This was my 5th OnePlus phone and it was one of the worst phone I had ever used. Kindly do something for betterment of phone and ur reputation.

"
"

  Fingerprint scanner is slow. night camera mode is not good when compared to realme x3. Headphone jack missing is the big drawback. Inbuilt themes customisation is not available.Sound quality is good.

"
"

  The product is absolutely fantastic.. It's soo smoothly working.. I loved the experience of OnePlus Nord.. Worth to b purchased at this price... Amazon delivered it on time nd it reached me in very good condition.. It was nicely packed.

"
"

  Please Don't buy it's a worst product of OnePlusDon't waste your money pleaseThere are networking drop isuue and phone some time hanging issues...battery is very poor

"
"

  It is really Amazing Phone..Amazing Fingerprint n Camera Quality.Battery life is okay okay. It needs atleast one time charging if you have heavy usage.. Otherwise. It is amazing...If your priority is Camera It is the best Phone..

  Likes:Battery charging speedCameraDisplayPerformanceDislikes:Battery draining  Totally ph was very suprb. That's why I gave 5 star and in this budget features are awesome I'm very enjoying every day.

"
"

  One off the best phone in the price segment. Awesome daily driver but needs improvement in battery and camera ü•∫ which I'm sure one plus would update in future software updates.if any1 planning for a gaming better to avoid this one ...

"
"

  It's not a out of the bod phone but has all the latest thing updated.From camera to performance all thing are great and plus the oxygen os adds a ring to it!!If you have budget ..its definitely a top pick!!

"
"

  Great phone, nothing to complain... To me camera is not flagship graded but still best under 30k.. Still after the recent update there is a tinting issue when brightness low.. And company should include the 3.5 mm adapter...

"
"

  Sometimes screen gets Shake.. if your use for long duration other wise... And I feel mobile size is also bit smaller...

"
"

  Fingerprint is very fast battery life is good not bad and average camera quality

"
"

  Good product, good battery life, some heating issues but negligable

"
"

  It's good if you go with 8 or 12 gb ram beause it is a 5G mobile ,camera is good but not the best , battery life is aslo great , fast charging ,some times fingerprint reader is not recognising, face unlike is working good ,no scratches are found

"
"

  Fabulous phone from OnePlus.. Smooth Os, 12/256gb, Camera is great but if you want more from your camera than install Gcam.ü•∞..(Gcam is ‚ù§Ô∏è)..M OnePlus user fron past 3yrs..so i trust this brand and its never disappointed me

"
"

  Love the dispaly.Audio is good.Rear Camera isn't that great. But the front facing is good.The software performance is good too.

"
"

  very pour camera quality and any other good quality . very bad mobile phone . unsatisfied with one plus . this phone is not worth that much money

"
"

  Just that it doesn't have headphone jack for that I need to buy a type-c connector that will be the solution to it. That's only one disadvantage.

"
"

  One plus still maintaining their decent performance when compared with other android smartphone.I am very satisfied and value for money.

"
"

  Nice phone. Ultimate looks and style. Screen is too nice. best phone by one plus

"
"

  Hi Team,Do not buy it it's so mnay software issue this smart phone..... Camera Not Good.... Bluetooth not connected....Year phone not connected... battery is very low and only backup 6 hours even admfer 100% charge.......

"
"

  i used 3 weeks camara quality goodbut gaming is worst phonewhen i install pubz immediately phone was heatedphone was using more timephone it will be heati think nord is more expensive but not satisfiedüëé

"
"

  Everything performance is good in this handset of OnePlus.. only battery drainage is the little problem..I'm satisfied with this product according to features given in it..I must say this is best phone in this price range.

"
"

  ¬†Side body quality is very poor.. And battery üîã drainage time ‚åö is very fast. Camera is very good in day light but in night mode its just worst in the range of 30k....finger unlock time is quite high

"
"

  Superb quality üëåüëåüëåIt is clear winner of this year in upper midrange smartphone.But delivery in same state for prime member is too late by amazon.I request you to Amazon keep all the promises as they send all gift & cashback

"
"

  Heating problem during phone calls.Battery is drained quickly even in phone calls and emails.Camera is not up to the mark.Amazon's and Seller's service are worst. Literally tired and frustrated.

"
"

  The nord is preety much everything you could ask for with great performance and decent camera.

"
"

  Good looking phone and the performance of this phone is nice. Coming to fingerprint reader and face lock they are ultra fast in detecting. The battery life is good and it charges very quickly. Camera is good in normal mode than in potrait mode.

"
"

  Awesome phone and even  battery is draining at medium rareIn the price of 30k it's a best optionI felt smooth experience by using it

"
"

  OnePlus has made the best cost managements for Nord. Loving it ‚ô•Ô∏è

"
"

  I was using OnePlus 5 before it.. and the experience of Nord is also good. There is lots of features in camera. Camera quality is very good. Also average battery life.

"
"

  Finger print is good camera quality good battery life better.

"
"

  Camera is really good...display n performance is good too.

"
"

  Fingerprints reader, battery life & Camera is perfect.... No lag in playing PUBG or more hard games performance is also perfect.

"
"

  Outstanding Phone. Fluidity at its peak . Nice camera(both) , video rcording quality with ois excellent experience,  90 hz amoled display was treat to eye, gud nightscape mode. FAST And Smooth experience Really like it this Nord....

"
"

  Bluetooth connectivity issue... paired devices gets disconnected after every 1-3 minutes... really annoying.. Same has not been resolved even with the latest 10.5.8 update as well.. wondering if it is a hardware issue... Pathetic...

"
"

  The phone is been delivered in very good condition. The camera quality is fascinating. The phone charging capacity is great, it goes from 0 to 70% in 30 mins which blew my mind.Overall experience is great.

"
"

  Nice looking..working fine..I have problem with hotspot...whenever I connect it to my lg smart tv...connection is not stable....I have checked with others mobile...with others connection works fine...I think it's nord problem...kind solve it..

"
"

  Value for moneyBiggest lacunae is the camera ,not upto required standards and quality .Battery drains but charging is also very fast.5G should be one s concern for purchase in present scenario.Rest  all looks cool

"
"

  Fantastic phone at this price. The 256gb variant is just smashing. Only drawback is the battery when isi bluetooth headphone. Drains very fast.

"
"

  Battery draining very fast, Even if normal use. Also camera quality is not up to mark.

"
"

  Its an amazing value for money smartphone  with so many pros and so less cons!

"
"

  I have purchased 12GB varient. Definitely a great value for money. Experience is fluid. Could have made some improvement on camera and also the screen when in dark shows glare near top left. Don't know whether it's a defect of not.

"
"

  Poor Network Support.Battery drained very quickly.Camera Quality not good at this price.Voice Fluctuations too much during the calling.Over all I suggest don't buy this one product to all who wants to buy this product.

"
"

  This phone is very good . Camera quality is awesome.. Battery life is very good if u are using this phone on 90hz refresh rate then it will take more battery comparable to using at 60hz ...This is a very affordable phone in this price range..

"
"

  Everything is in mobile is very good . Like camera , batery , fingerprint sensor , display quality , sound is very good ......But Gaming performance is very bad ........While play asphalt 9 game is hanged or automatically games is closed.....

"
"

  Camera quality is average. Not as good as claimed. But I'm okay with it. Rest, the phone is amazing. My only disappointment was that the width of the phone is less than other phones.

"
"

  Even though this is anlow budgeted phone it is great setting it up is really easy and simple same same it is to use it is one of the most user-friendly phone's I've had considering my last phone was an iPhone X

"
"

  ¬†After waiting for 22 days I got this result. Not only display problem even the default apps are missingTried to click a photo and could'nt view it.Customer care people didn't respond my call.

"
"

  Never Gonna order another Phone from amazon. Not providing replacement after several complains.

"
"

  100% to 20 % in 4  hours only worst battery  lifeinternet slow speed problemscalling problemshang too much sometime i used it for 2weeksand im disappointed dont buy this  deviceits just wastage of money

"
"

  Nord is perfect for normal user and also for gamers. But I am disappointed with the camera.Video recording is perfect but photo shoot is not that much great. Also the macro lens is useless.

"
"

  Best phone...best build quality...best camera....best processorAll over is best...fully satisfied ü§©ü§©

"
"

  I using this phone about 5 days ago ..no problem face.  Only battery is not so powerful.. otherwise camera is awesome..fingerprint reader is so fast..charging is very fast...oxygen os give you a smoothness.90hz display is awesome...go for it

"
"

  Good performance so far. No issue found in the phone so far. Punch holes for 2 front camera are looks bit odd while watching display.

"
"

  Poor performance. Failure model. Continuous hanging

"
"

  Camera quality of the phone is very very disappointed therefore I had returned the product.Also nothing wow feeling after using it. Not wrothy at all.

"
"

  I am giving 4 starts to this.. Pics with back camera are good but not happy with selfies.. battery drains fast which is a negative point but with warp charger it gets fully charged in 30mins.. apart from this phone is satisfactory

"
"

  Battery life is not so great, I can hardly get 4 hour screentime, if I use Netflix battery drains faster than using other apps.Camera quality is not upto the mark for 48mp sensor.Fingerprints reader is great

"
"

  Don't buy this phone I'm facing battery draining issue and heating issue please wait now let it be fix in my suggestion wait sometime

"
"

  Defective product. Even incoming calls could not be attended. Error message coming like close app, send feedback. Advised not to buy. Before returning, the return window closed. Waste of money I feel

"
"

  Nothing so say much, just loved the phone, if you want a phone under 30,000 then just go for it üíôüíô

"
"

  Great phone at this price. Better camera if compare with k20 pro.

"
"

  after sending SMS to some body who is having oneplus mobile I noted that similar type of web site is also delivered to other person which is not correct. I lodged a complaint but no satisfactory response from oneplus then I sold the Mobile.

"
"

  The battery is draining so fast and nightscape was good but after updating device the nightscape is not working well.. I am very disappointed with Nord camera quality and battery...and while playing pubg I see many lags even it is new phone

"
"

  Haptic feedback is soo good. It's above my expectations.

"
"

  Very disappointed to me am first time spend money this much of amount now am think very worst ,battery drain fastly even using 60hz then why this much of issue .pls fix if possible to software update pls do it first.üò£

"
"

  Mobile is good in this price rangeBut it's not as much good as it was expected from battery backup to haptic touch response to camera quality to performance these everything are just as normal in this price range

"
"

  I have face couple of issue.1. Front camera lag issue2. Slow response on finger print reader3. Strange issue that I never expected from Oneplus, during call time call was getting disconnected and the loading page come up.

"
"

  Battery backup is very poor. Heavy drainage is there...you all need to charge your phone 2-3 times in a day. Camera quality is not so good and blur pucture captures. Lots of expectations was there with One Plus but this has fail this time.

"
"

  First time I purchase one plusBut bad experienceCamera bakwasBattery bakwasRest of is okayIf camera and better issues solved through software update than okOtherwise don't purchaseDon't waste money

"
"

  One Plus nord Mobile is waste phone so many problems this phone calls recorder not available contact shering via sms through not support  talking the call internet not connect and file manager photo sliding not support so phone is very bad

"
"

  I am using this phone from last 3 days...my ratings are as below.Looks - 4 / 5Camera - 3 / 5Battery - 3 / 5Fingerprint scanner - 4 - 5Calling - 4 / 5Brightness - 2 / 5Price - 3 / 5

"
"

  Battery life is good chargeing is very fast as well as 90 hz refresh rate is also best and the fingerprint scanner response best camera is also best front selfish is best over all a good 5g buget phone

"
"

  First I was hesitate to place an order due to negative reviews.But Nord is such an awesome mobile...total package in mid range phones..,I am not a gamer...so except games all is working perfectly..no display issues...

"
"

  Excellant mobile

"
"

  1 st time buying OnePlus very very good I love it, tuch screen very smooth camera clearity good battery good 20 mint charging full bettery capacity 24 hrs.

"
"

  Happy with this purchase runs smoothly and don't have any issues

"
"

  More than my expectations after 2 week of usage no issues in phone ... night camera is awesome ..I played pubg for 6 hours in full charge .. battery backup is good .. ONEPLUS NORD is very awesome Thanks to ONEPLUS Team and AMAZON.....

"
"

  For the beginner to ONEPLUS , obviously you can go for it,,, but I used OnePlus 6 earlier,, I wish I couldn't have upgraded!!!Disappointed with camera and display!! Camera is not at all realistic!!! Not expected this from OnePlus ü§ß

"
"

  It's not the flagship product which I expect .... Not so bad but I m confused. Because I don't understand that I paid 30 thousands for this product is worth it or not. Actually I m little bit disappointed. Team OnePlus, please try hard üôè

"
"

  Fingerprint reader working fine..but face lock is working bit slow.Battery lifeüôÉüôÅ

"
"

  After years of only releasing top-tier flagships, OnePlus is back in the mid-range category with the OnePlus Nord. Finger print reader is very fast, good battery life with awesome camera.

"
"

  Most important is it's assembled in India which made my decision to buy OnePlus NORD . Long bettery life Great camara quality and functiong

"
"

  Battery and fingerprint reader is very good. Camera quality is ok.. But not superb!!

"
"

  Worst cameraDidn't expect this from one plusNot at all worth for 30kThis looks like cheap phone in a range of 15k

"
"

  This was simply amazing. Well you all know as ONE PLUS will always do great job. Here is a piece of worth buying the marvelous OnePlus Nord. I bought blue marble 8gb + 128GB varient and to be frank, this was awesome.

"
"

  All is good but a price is little bit higher .Camera quality is goodAnd there is no issue of green tint in screen .Some time i am facing a Bluetooth connectivity issues when i am on call .

"
"

  All in one powerful set. Design, grip, comfortable, camera quality perfect but take little time to process image. Face unlock superfast and accurate . Fingerprint sensor is good.

"
"

  Picture quality is excellent and one day battery life and finger print sensor is excellent overall phone is excellent and  very good

"
"

  Hi there, I just got all new Nord everything good as I understand but similarly the Bluetooth does not warking it's working weird automatically turn off while I play games..please if anyone have any kind of solution then reply thankyou:)

"
"

  The green tint issue is real. I have compared it with another 12gb variant while mine is 8gb, provided your are in the dark mode under greyish background. Below 40 percent it got a minor green tint. Otherwise, it is perfect for under 30.

"
"

  Worst camera ever in this price rangeOxygen OS is smooth , processor is ok for moderate usage. But camera really sucks . Didn't expect this worse. Better go for samsung midranges. I didn't get the feel of one plus like ,

"
"

  I am a light userFound this phone helps in many aspectsRear Camera is by default 12MP and the quality of pics is not soo good.

"
"

  The thing which I don't like, I pre-ordered it from Amazon I thought amazon will provide the same goodies and gifts which was provided by OnePlus if order the same from OnePlus website. But I was wrong, I should have ordered from OnPlus.

"
"

  I am using it with two jio sims. Tha sims get invalid very often. Then callers are given massage that phone is switched off. In last one month of its use it has happened about 6-7 times.

  As a first user of oxygen os, the oneplus stands itself for it's performance and user experience

"
"

  Camara quality and battry life is good but processer and performance is amazing in this device and we qlso compare to apple üçé on thi device

"
"

  worth for every penny, speed is super awesome with 12 GB ram, only front camera is not up to mark but although I do not use camera so often.

"
"

  Camera quality 10/10Battery life 10/10Game Performance 10/10Overall the Best in class in this price pointBought it in first flash saleUsing this for nearly 3 months no issuesWorth the price

"
"

  1st Felt smooth experience in mobile phones. For normal usage also battery draining very fastly. Max SOT 6hrs only. However battery retaining from morning to evening. Except this battery issue remaining all awesome in mobile.

"
"

  Wastage of money... screen turned blue after use of sometimes.... defective piece sent... kindly replace it.... otherwise action need to be sent against seller...sold defective piece...28 k waste

"
"

  Finger print reader, face lock is great! Battery life and cam quality is also very good, overall a great mobile for this price range!

"
"

  Well good phone , though the battery drain a little quick though got fast charging so no worries ! Little bit confused about camera ! Default pics are clicked by 12mp cam you have to select for 48mp cam !

"
"

  Go for your nerd....ignore the negative reviews...its more than you can ask for a phone at this cost...its my first phone ...since i graduated ...and i am extremely happy that it has to be the nord#mynord

"
"

  This phone is beast and has a premium look.  it has issues with front ""camera quality"" video recording even after the updates, gives good gaming And  smooth xperience overall best ""battery life"" and probably best mid-range phone

"
"

  Front Camera is not so good but ok....if you are beauty mode lover...this phone is not for you.....overall good perfomarmance.Low battery pefomarnce

"
"

  Using this phone after 1 week describe about phone1.camera is good2.battery life is ok ok like for 1 day it is good3.fingerprint and face lock is fast4.48 mp camera has no zoom optionOver all phone is good

"
"

  All things ok ..not best but ok..But bettry life is very poor..... U hv chrge atleast 2 -3 times in a day if u r PUBG lover..If u ply 1 game 15 min it will drain 8-10%Nd if u ply 1 hr it will drain üòÖ 50%(approx).....

"
"

  Bad camera quality also sound is not good. They are just fooling the people on the name of sale , sale , sale....we people are paying 28k ‚Çπ  but it's not worthy. Don't purchase OnePlus 5G nord . Genuinely saying just waste of money....

"
"

  Go for it

"
"

  Awesome phone.. Battery charging and battery life both are good, i dnt play games so can't tell but over all performance is fabulous, highly recommended..!!! Hope I get my pre order gift ASAP..!!

"
"

  I really loved the phone. It's amazing. Worth every penny. ""Grey onyx "" recommended colour.. the depth sensor is outstanding. All the people who wants to change their cellphone.. go for it. It's mind blowing.

"
"

  Awesome phone. The best smartphone under 30000 . Display is excellent. Super fast.

"
"

  Display good, Battery backup is fine not bad, No screen issue, gaming graphics good overall good for this price range, only one problem camera not worthy for this price maybe feature camera updates solve the issue

"
"

  I brought this phone in 17 august and return requested ok 20th date. I got heating issue. Phone started heating after using video recordering for just 2 mint. Over all phone is good but returned due heating issue.

"
"

  Green Tint And Pink Tint ProblemCamara very Poor

"
"

  Battery life is not good, otherwise good item.

"
"

  Very good phone in this segment I m happy with this phone camera is awesome display is very clear worth for money blindly go for this mobile who want camera and net speed.Battery should little bit big otherwise phone is awesome.

"
"

  Display and battery life is really good. And the oxygen OS makes the user experience worth the price. The camera could have been better though. Nightscape photographs are good. But the macro mode and portrait mode are not good enough.

"
"

  Good phone everything is fine but I spent 30,000/-  to play pubg in extreme or 90 fps (frame rates) but didn't get that so what is the profit for me to have a 90 hzs fully amoled screen if I am not able to use it in gamesThanku.

"
"

  Apperas that gorilla glass not being used on back camera. Not sturdy as other OnePlus models

"
"

  Best Value Phone By OnePlus

"
"

  Best value for money product....had options like m51 and 7 pro but bought this and after using it I think my decision was perfect .....awesome camera quality and no battery draining at all.... Love this one plus device.....

"
"

  Oneplus wireless z mic is not using by pubg, voice recorder and video camera in OnePlus Nord besides it's use built in microphone in phone . But in calls and Google assistant it's mic work. Please help me out. Give update .

"
"

  All things camera battery back up performance is very good

"
"

  Amazing picture quality. Battery life is too good. Works for 2 days on a single charge. Quickly charges. Plus you get a huge storage capacity. 5 stars!

"
"

  Need to know one thing....before you buy this...it's not flagship level ...it does the job but user interface and software performance is at best....!! Go for 12+256GB so that it  can run for long....!!

"
"

  Wrost ever camera experienceLow light performance is very badNight mood was good but other camera experience was wrostYou can buy realme X2 then this phone it's my wrost experience In this phone

"
"

  Its good but. Not like that one plus created the hype of it. According to me this phone is lower than redmi k20 pro. Only best thing is fast charging but battery consumption is like same as a charging capabilitie

"
"

  Previously used oppo f7 for around 2 years, was a great experience.. bought one plus on my sister's recommendation.. works well but only issue is battery life.. not so good.. other all is good.. you can go for it

"
"

  Ya this product is very good comfortable to use camera quality is pixels coming..

"
"

  Overall best package for me. As a professional I am very impressed with OnePlus os. Really great phone. Only the camera should be needed slightly improvement.

"
"

  This is from amazon linq store, kollam. I ordered this item for my friend. Yesterday i opened the box, packing was ok, but display shown scratches...so kindly request you to change the phone...warrenty not started till now

"
"

  Regular user of OnePlus Mobile Phones and am very happy of commitments fulfilled with Nord.

"
"

  Don't Fall in rumors.For a non gamer no phone is better than this in this range.But a little improvement needed in indoor light camera.

"
"

  Over all mobile was okay. It gets warm if you use for 30 minutes. Front camera is not upto the mark. Don't expect much and create Hype among yourself.

"
"

  Battery Darin very fastLook wise phone is very good.There some issues in display.

"
"

  Best product to buy do not listen to roumers and updates have been come and restored the macro camera and everything is perfect and goodWorth to buy it I bought it on 31st August and everything look excellent now and will good

"
"

  Product  not working ,and poor support for amezon customer service also. . . Thair is no return and replacement chances also. . .  Amezon main thought jest for sale otherways not a customer support . . .  Jest leve it customer . . .

"
"

  It is a quite good overall package. Has nice and fast performance as expected from Oneplus. The software is the cherry on top. Camera is also good. Battery life lasts for 1 day with heavy usage and the charging is impressively fast.

"
"

  Very nice mobileCamera quality also very goodIt's looks like a so goodOne of the best mobile undre 30kGood gaming mobileFingerprint & face unlock is too fastI'm happy to purchase this mobile....üòç

"
"

  ONE+ NORD IS SUPERB PHONE WITH CAMERA QUALITY ALSO SUPERB AND BATTERY BACKUP  IS 24 HOUR,BUT CHARGER OF NORD IS SO FAST IT WILL CHARGE FULL IN HALF AN HOUR AND SIZE OF PHONE IS GOOD& SOUND QUALITY IS ALSO BEST..............I LIKE IT

"
"

  One of worst mobiles from a cheating Chinese company OnePlus. poorest quality camera,worst display and pathetic and phone with lot of lags while using for normal tasks.amazon must return and refund else we have to seek legal opinion

"
"

  Phone suddenly got switched off not getting restart please help me for warranty I bought phone on 6 aug 2020

"
"

  A phone that feels premium and performs like a premium device..Only major complaint is that the cameras need more optimization as there are issues like shutter lag in the front camera..

"
"

  i didnt want tinted tellow display on 30000 device

"
"

  Loving it... would update the review later on....

"
"

  Apt for the said budget.

"
"

  Worst product...Battery drains in four hoursNot at all worth money

"
"

  It's betry must be 4500 mh it may be posible i think

"
"

  big issue with phone as it will not show any signals to make call or recieve and even oneplus team is not providing any support for the same. dont buy

"
"

  Good product and the camera is very nice battery backup is very nice and the life battery life is also very nice it is very comfortable to use and so many new features to explore fingerprint access is very nico

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is slow, battery backup too good, there is grey line along with front camera punch hole, visilbe when we reducing the brightness while watching videos/ movies.Not seen easily.

"
"

  Not worth for itz prize , simply the touch gets struck and it getz hang so often , in my opinion dont buy it, rather than this problems everything works fine , looks good and not a worth buying mobile

"
"

  The only thing I don't like is the camera at times. Else the performance is amazing.Pubg works on Smooth Extreme mode.No lags so far.But heating issue when you switch on the Hotspot.

"
"

  Phone is heating too much... and service option not working.

"
"

  Super fast phoneNetwork superbPhone speed awesomeBattery drain fastCamera quality not good just averageNo audio jack..it's big problemGood designAll over a good phone for professional usage

"
"

  Used this for 15 days now, Battery and camera are decent, display is very good, OS is very good, only disappointed with camera & batterybecause there is no use of other 2 rear cameras overall good phone at this price point...

"
"

  Amazon service excellentBut some function are missing like auto call recorder newer buy this third class phoneTomorrow I have to go to the service centerThird class phone sell my Nord on OLXPlz don't buy this phone

"
"

  Worst phone ever bought in my entire life

"
"

  Not worth for 28k...overpriced phone...23k to 25k price should be ok.for this phone.

"
"

  It is smooth and working absolutely fine. Fingerprint can be more quick but face recognition is good. Battery life is decent and give u full day backup as per usage. Overall nord is buy worthy and it will not let u down.

"
"

  Camera quality does not meet what was expected.And sometimes fingerprint reader takes time. Bettery life is although pretty good if u use it full day then u only need to charge twice a day and still some remaining.

"
"

  Very good product. Marble blue is eye catchy. Vibrant display. Front camera is fantastic. Back camera is good but it can be the best with few updates. The glass finish has a premium quality.Very good product.

"
"

  There is issue with display there is screen tint issue it's slightly reddish near power button try to contact customer support for replacement but no one responding after holding half n hour you can check attached images

"
"

  Its feel great in hand...

"
"

  Best phone all rounder üíõ

"
"

  Not as expected, camera quality is not upto the mark eve. Battery life is 5h in gaming.phone hitting issue while charging. Also i got this phone delivered in around 25 days

"
"

  Nice phone for everyday use and moderate to heavy gaming. screen is best. Camera is not great but not bad as well. Feel while holding and operating is very good. Go for it!

"
"

  Augmented reality AR is not supported... Why given in advertisement... Should clarify on the same.Other than AR support all working fine...Over all good deal...

"
"

  PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS MOBILE BECAUSE IN THIS MOBILE HAVE AUTOMATIC RESET PROBLEM.I AM FACING MORE ISSUE BUT I AM NOT BE GETTING SOLUTION

"
"

  Best mid-range phone. Don't go for any other phone in this price range.This is the best choice.Many may say many defects or cons but don't mind,they are just jealous.Once u use this device ,u never hate it because it is oxygen os.

"
"

  Battery backup last for 24hrs easily.Camera is decent not extra ordinary.Fingerprint sensor works gud.Display runs smoothly 90hz refresh rate quit gud.All the features in phone are balanced.Go for it.

"
"

  Every thing is good but two problems are there1.battery is small2.phone heats even on normal usage or on one match of pubg.

"
"

  Takes a while to adjust to..... Because the processor is a bit slow then expected but value for money

"
"

  As soon as it turnrd on , it updated itself and went back to sleep with crashdump Flashing on screen . Returned back nxt day

"
"

  Phone is good looking, touch and refresh rate is also good but overall issue facing is hanging problems in net surfing otherwise phone is so smooth.

"
"

  It's a pretty good device for the price point. If u want a true flagship killer then 7t is better choice. This one is midrange flagship killer. Oxygen os make it feel snappy. Easily recommendable. Overall 8/10 for Nord.

"
"

  I Buy Blue marble Colour Very Awseome. camera Quality is Very Good. Display is very good. And feel like very expensive phone

"
"

  Sim not working please don‚Äôt buy , display is poor , worst mobile ever, just under rated mobile , don‚Äôt buy please go for apple mobile

"
"

  The phone colour is beautiful. Fingerprint is on the screen. Camera clarity is good. Worth the price. Best Budgeted phone by One Plus.

"
"

  Not worth of 30K, auto switch off and on found within 3 days of usage, poor network connectivity, battery life is worst. Poor display quality. Camera quality is not upto mark. Trying to return with in 7 days.

"
"

  total watse of money....camera quality 3rd class...both front and back.....please dnt buy this phone .....even you cant return this produt....the amazon policy changed....the product can be replaced .....but can't be returned....

"
"

  Pros:1.oxygen os2.battery life3.warp charge4.5G5.90hz amoled displayCons:1. High price2.765 proccesor only for moderate use3.no memory card slot

"
"

  Quality at a best price...Compromise  with processor

"
"

  I have bought a 12gb 256 gb variant and it's heating like a iron rod. Highly disappointed with one plus.. need to return this phone üëé

"
"

  Probably my last OnePlus...no longer the original OnePlus proposition ....to costly, nothing exceptional on features vis a vis half costing options

"
"

  It's a mid range phone with a very bad display u see the pinkish tint on the corners of the display whn brightness is decreased below 25% not worth for the price n one plus is just using its brand name to fool the ppl.

"
"

  Worst phone made by one plus , hang problem , green tint issue , dotted line in the display, mobile gets hang for 10 minutes after. That it returns back to normal position... Don't buy this phone in one plus company...

"
"

  The phone is amazing as per design and performance but highlighted camera is below expectation. The camera is very poor in this price segment. Oneplus failed to deliver the best midrange phone as the hype have created.

"
"

  I use one plus Nord from 2 days but and I found that a calculator is not working properly and I think it's mobile display problem...

"
"

  All though it took time to get it delivered even after pre booking .I am too happy with the phone .It is a beast with all the premium features .Good one One Plus

"
"

  Camera quality is not like earlier OnePlus products. I have a nokia product 12k cheaper, that takes better quality and overall performance wise is better.

"
"

  It's nice. I was previously using MI Note 05. Comparatively the experience is good. I don't see why the hype tho. Should've probably fine for MI Note 09 . It's cheaper ;)

"
"

  Overall it's a good experience only thing I am disappointed with is the camera performance & the gaming experience rest all the experience is good specially with that oxygen colour OS & also the quick charge & overall experience

"
"

  Finger print sensor is not that fast , battery life is awesome it works for more than 12hrs once charged hardly it takes 45 mins to charge fully and camera quality is also good can buy this phone best at this price from one plus

"
"

  Fingure prin reader is ausome, battery life is good and camera quality is excellent.. the time of charging is super fast... Best mobile phone in its range it even compete phones beyond 5k..... Bonus it's 5G compatible

"
"

  Pretty much everything you ask for.. Pretty decent mobile..only battery backup is not satisfying..But anyway a good purchase

"
"

  Everything Okay but phone is getting heating so much, don't know what to do but its heat is much higher than I had ever seen in any handset.

"
"

  This phone is all you need to do every task in daily life. You can play every game at high quality and have no issues in performance. Camera is really good.Overall a perfect phone for your daily needs

"
"

  Camera quality is good as expected.Nightscape is just wow....Overall the product is worth buy....!!

"
"

  Battery back-up is pathetic , barely last for a day. Camera quality is really horrible for a 25k + smartphone that too from OnePlus.

"
"

  Using it since 15 August 2020. The phone is overall ok considering the price. Most disappointing features are battery and front camera location. Camera is good.

"
"

  I don't generally write reviews but I feel cheated. I bought this phone coz I wanted to upgrade my phone camera. I am very disappointed with the camera quality.

"
"

  Very worst mobile ever i have saw. WhatsApp video call is not shown. Sometimes it hangs at calling and slow down. Poor battery life.

"
"

  It's a pure hype rather the phone is like any regular model. This is the most bulkiest and heaviest phone have ever used. I didn't feel premium when I  hold the phone in hand. Looks like any ordinary phone. Not worth of money.

"
"

  Phone is having heating issueAnd on sale amazon is giving 7 days return policy  and jusf adjusting defective piecesUseless customer serviceAnd non-cooperating behaviourDont waste ur money on this # nord

"
"

  Very disappointed with the product when I received the mobile it was having air bubble on the screen and minor scratches too on screen guard this not what you expect from a 28k mobile not satisfied with the product and service

"
"

  The product looks great, with nice finish, but the one plus packing was found slightly damaged at corner. This was never expected from the seller and is unsatisfactory.

"
"

  Full satisfaction in 30k good for future generations 5g and also midrange performance processor sg 765g but it's good and camera wide angle is not good and same has forte camera also wide angle is not good

"
"

  Its good, I think camara is updated ,it is best  regular use except  camara it's very good in every thing  ...I use to give 4

"
"

  Not great battery life. Use to get hit while charging. Also 1 SIM slot getting disabled which after restart getting activated. Not a good camera even with 48 mega pixel. My earlier 6t was much better. Thinking of returning it.

"
"

  If you are an avg daily user using the phone for calls, simple but good photography, couple of hours of gaming, video streaming, then this is the best phone you can get in the price range..Buy it without doubt

"
"

  Excellent display.. better charging speed.. battery life is okay drains faster than anticipated.. camera quality is satisfactory.. really good performance .. no complaints about the product other than battery issues

"
"

  Best in the market at this price range with a set of quality fetures which gives a feel of a awesome experience. No complaints so far with device, performance and user experience... Really worthy at this price range

"
"

  Such a like best mobile under 30000 ....best one plus

"
"

  Withing 20 days of using phone start auto switch off, customer care are not giving proper help. totally dissatisfied... package to just branding not at all flagship.. skull without brain

"
"

  Best product at this price point and decent look bit the problem is in the quad cam setup the two cam that are for depth and macro are just useless don't even bother about that two cams

"
"

  In the limited time spent with the phone so far, Nord seems to be a very good device. Delivery was very fast. Order was placed on 21st afternoon and phone was delivered in 22nd morning.

"
"

  1. Heating problem2. Camera quality is not good3. Network problem4. Not up to the mark5. High price low quality.6. No Automatic call recording.Dot buy this product just waste of money

"
"

  this is not oneplus actuallythis is sub brand of oneplusso don't think about features are same as one plusbut this is good deal at this price

"
"

  I got this phone next day of the order. I like the phone very much. One month ago used this phone and no issues till now..

"
"

  Not so great phone. Bad cam and speaker. The voice is bursting even at low volumes.Camera , I didn't see much difference in normal and potrait üôÇ

"
"

  Premium quality mobile phone. Superb camera, excellent display,  finishing is good

"
"

  Overall it‚Äôs a good phone & good batt life compared to others if we use in 60Hz ,but camera needs a huge improvement and they lack in that departmentDefinitely needs an improvement in camera department.

"
"

  I have used the phone for just an hour and I feel hot over the back side of the phone.Battery life not that much good

"
"

  Battery life not good in half of the day once again i hve to chargeI m seriously thinking to return this order üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

"
"

  The product is not that excellen.  It is much hyped.

"
"

  Loved the 90Hz refresh rate display. Very reactive. The battery is on par with the performance. Can go about 12-14 hours on a single charge. This is with datapack/WiFi on all the time.

"
"

  I'm not that much game lover, but  truly I must say that.this phone at this price range would not disappoint you, and how can forget out Oxygen Os gyus , it gives you way better experience than any other other smartphones üíô

"
"

  Yesterday got update now i am satisfied nord mobile camera quality and process fantastic feeling happy to use love one plus nord

"
"

  Amazing phone...pls don't believe the negitive reviews....for games it's better and rest is all superb.....best smartphone for best price fingerprint is good and camera is excellent and good battery life

"
"

  The mobile is good with 765G series having 90Hz and have 30T wrap charger, charging 100% within 70min. Usage for normal purpose, no heavy load, for daily lifestyle. And camera neeeds lots of improvement.

"
"

  Flagship features and feel and rightly priced.

"
"

  It is best in all segments except camera and battery

"
"

  The battery life is not upto the mark. The night mode of the camera is not good honestly. And 28k is a bit high price compared to its facilities. Otherwise it's smoothness is really comforting.

"
"

  It's very bad experience with One Plus Nord, i received the mobile on 2nd Sep 2020, battery getting discharge very fast within normal usage, who is looking more battery battery don't purchase this mobile.

"
"

  Battery drain very fast...ü§îUfs.2 very bad ...data transferring...lost

"
"

  The phone is good at all aspects but after some days Ms Excel and word were improperly closing and i had to uninstall them. The biggest drawback is no headphone and 3.5mm jack. in addition oneplus earbuds are costly to buy.

"
"

  Amazing phone with all loaded features. Feels very premium and confident.Phone back panel color is just brilliant.Best 5G phone with loaded features in this price segment.

"
"

  Worst front camera in low lighting. It's a nightmare by OnePlus. My previous OP5 is better than nord in this issue. I'll give a five-star if it is rectified by a software update soon.

"
"

  Buy only for smooth operation and camera does not your prime need specially selfie.Selfie camera is too bad .Only for this i want to return this but i have no option.very poor camera quality

"
"

  No.1  under 30000 kBest camera, specially night mode, portrait, 4k video 10 on 10Fast chargeing 10 on 10battery life greAt.Light wieght, Handy phone easy to use single handGo for it.

"
"

  ¬†Fingerprint fast reader ... Battery life havy use 1 whole day . .. but disappointed camera .. but don't worry oxygen os I thik feature update fixx all small problem ..

"
"

  After using this phone about 25days.I found it nice, decent camera, good performance. But it got problem of reboot, as many times it ask for reboot and sometimes got switched off itself.

"
"

  One plus thank u for giving us such a amazing deal nord is the best phone compairing it with other phone of the same price range I recommend it to all of you who are in the search of new phone

"
"

  Descent OnePlus nord phoneBattery backup is better I'm so glad recieving phone from AmazonAmoled display phone run smoothly30t warp charger is best 100% charged only 1 hourPhone experience is an good

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is quick. On an average use battery life is 18 hours, however phone charges quickly. Camera is best. I would recommend this phone.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  The camera still boasts the main primary camera from OP8 but I think they haven‚Äôt tweaked the performance on purpose.Under mid-light or average lighting conditions , It clicks really Grainy and off color photos

"
"

  I am using oneplus nord since 4 days and i am facing very  bad display issue. my device display has screen burn issue . after using some time the pixels on the display goes stuck. very bad experience.  i want my money back

"
"

  Awesome phone ,nice camera, color production was good during video and photos,you can also perform moderate task like 720p 1080 p video editing. Overall nice phone yet I would recommed go for 8gb or 12 gb  Ram varient.  üòá

"
"

  This is my One of the best smartphone

"
"

  I was charging my mobile and suddendly my display was showing some white light and my touch is not working...

"
"

  If you thinking to buy this phone than go for itIt is awesome phone I m using these phone last one month .  it works properly.#fullpaisewasulYou will not regret.

"
"

  I ordered it in GIF sale..VALUE FOR MONEY VERY SMOOTH IN USELOOK SIMILAR AS SHOWN IN PICTURESCOLOUR IS VERY PRETTYBut need improvement in camera, it is not as expected...

"
"

  Superb Phone .Got delivered on 25 Aug 20.Will review again later after usage.

"
"

  My first OnePlus device. Loving everything, especially the Oxygen OS. It's a good midranger. Don't think twice, just go for it

"
"

  They shouldn't have gone ahead with Warp Discharging, as most users dont like it.Fine with the display, look and user experience.

"
"

  I used it for 3 months iam sharing my experience it's a good phone but it's finger prints is laging sometimesFor best phone for this price it's display is very good has HD quality

"
"

  No doubts this phone really is really very great....awesome smooothness and touch and an amazing fast experience with this phone

"
"

  Camera and battery life is not as expected,Google serch is not working properly some time let down. Overall performance does not match the brand image of oneplus...

"
"

  OnePlus nord camera üì∏ very very photo bad

"
"

  Very fast finger print and excellent camara quality but some low light condition avg quality picss.. overoll excellant Phone iam using this phone in 2 months and after I write this review ..such value for money this phone

"
"

  This phone was not good there aree sooomany problem in this phone i m facing in call recoding there is a record ing warning to the caller , if we text someone a contact then it can not be sent as sms it can be sent as mms

"
"

  Overall performance is good except for camera quality which is very bad according to previous one plus phones.In low light pictures are very blurry. And image quality is also not that good. Lot of colour variations.

"
"

  Extraordinary product under 30 kGood cameraFinger print senser sense within secondsI'm happy to say OnePlus has released middle range phone while playing games like pubg it's very smooth to play the game

"
"

  Battery drains faster and camera quality is not at all good. My last phone redmi note 7 pro gave me better battery life in the initial stages not life nord. I can't return also now. And network problem while Playing pubg.

"
"

  camera  not working properly.front camera take bulr pics. macro camera is worst. other all app and functions are superb.oxygen os is better than other.features are excellent.1080p video in youtube is mindblowing resultion

"
"

  Good Phone. Looks nice. Color is beautiful. Performance is smooth. Camera seems good. Overall a good value for money.

"
"

  Disappointed with product quality and camera

"
"

  Display resolution fine good one actually you all feel difference

"
"

  Good quality products but speaker volume very slow and battery also decent but display quality is super camera quality not very good please improve camera quality but over all one plus good work for this mobile

"
"

  Sim slot not working properly automatically off and on . Call also cut automatically and newtork signals  two Sim network off and on . calling senor not working . This is very disappointed to buy one plus nord.

"
"

  All over the phone is awesome better build quality but improve camera quality night shots are not upto the mark they called it that the steal camera from oneplus 8 but oneplus 7 capture better than it

"
"

  Trust me It's the best phone in the range it also does not matter that it has 765G because of he Oxygen Os and you will get a flagship kind of performance.

  I feel it's the best phone in this range. Such amazing camera quality and love shooting with it. The processor is quite fast and sensor detects within seconds. No complaints till now

"
"

  Touch screen is not so good, even back botton is not there keep so slow work, calculator is too much slow. This is a average product.

"
"

  The images shot are are blurry and grainy!! Has video/image optical stabilization issues!!Very bad camera quality experience!!!

"
"

  It's actually dual camera, not quad camera. Last two cameras 5mp 2mp are not useful infact it seems that they are not working

"
"

  I got this as a birthday gift on my birthday and for sure this is one of the smoothest phone I've used ! I have been using this from about 2 month now and I have not faced any issue. You should definitely try this one...

"
"

  Battery drains as fast as it charges. It fully charges in 30 minutes and fully drains in 3 hours. Unless u want to live the covid life at home always and be connecting ur phone to charger 5 times a day, do not go for it.

"
"

  Received phone on 2/8/20, initial impressions are good. Will update further after few days.

"
"

  Superb Phone ... Up to me it is a best one. Attached some photos taken by Nord after updated 10.5.7 . Really great.

"
"

  Experience with Nord is good.i think this product is one of best in it's range.battery life one of the best think in Nord.i feel this product best experience while playing games best mbl for games...

"
"

  Excellent product thank you OnePlus and Amazon ,Ensure next time fast delivery all products, courier not respond properly ....

"
"

  I upgraded from one plus 5 to but it  didnt meet my expectations infact its useless.sold after 5 days with loss of 2500 on olx

"
"

  Camera quality is not good....... Wide angle is below average and macro is awful. I don't suggest this phone to anyone else.

"
"

  Front camera is not upto the mark. Back camera is awesome

"
"

  Sure Worth for money. This is not up to the other One Plus phones. This model is more like a Realme.Selfie camera video quality is amazing with clear voice capture.

"
"

  It could be better , if they would have not moved towards assembling a cheaper phone..Quality of the phone doesn't meet the expectation of investing 28kHope you have a great clientele this year #1plus

"
"

  Camera quality ,first get blured and then clear, slow processing, not satisfied with cameraNot for value for money.In this budget , other brands are doing great but totally disappointed with OnePlus brand..

"
"

  I bought 12\256 marble blue, Mobile is good but disappointed with camera, camera is not upto mark.

"
"

  The front camera has really disappointed. Pls have a camera test before you buy this. Also not able to return this product.

"
"

  Awesome

"
"

  One of the fastest ever Mobile processer and Excellent Camera Quality with Best ever price.Go for it without any doubtsDo not buy Apply or Samsung they are cheap as per my point of view

"
"

  Worst battery life with 4000+mah battery draining like anything. Not expected from OnePlus.@Amazon, worst service providing, why you're not accepting return or replacement of this Product...?

"
"

  The phone is okay with a great display. The amazonn delivery was pathetic. Could have improved battery back up and camera.

"
"

  Everything best in relation to price but battery drains heavily...display is crisp....

"
"

  Fingerprint-goodBattery life-back up normal use 7-8 hrsCamera quality-in zooming image/video bad.micro camara also bad...baring all images/videosAll not good in 30,000,,better camera 20,000

"
"

  Good product, quality and style. Not as good as other OnePlus products!! Cam doesn't seems to be upto the mark, performance is pretty okey, not as great as 7/8 one Plus.

"
"

  I have been using Samsung for years now, but as expected One Plus's performance is just awesome. Camera and it's modes are sharp/natural clicks, GUI is smooth, however the only challenge I encounter was sad battery !!

"
"

  SIM slot was faulty... Amazon's Customer Service sucks..  Denied replacement and initiated a refund even without asking..Had suffered a financial loss of 1700rs because of cancelation/termination of EMI...

"
"

  I just love this phoneFingerprint reader is so awesome üòòBettery life is so good ‚ù§Ô∏èCamera quality is so so good üòòIf you are looking very good phone with high quality in this range so go for it

"
"

  It feels good with OnePlus NORD.. really superb quality pictures and oxygen OS is much easier and customisable. Hardly recommend..

"
"

  Finderprint reader great,battery life improve for update,and camera quality Excellent... great experience thish device.. thanks üëç

"
"

  bought 12 gb version 1 wk back ... very bad main rear camera... till now no update for  same.. pictures look like water color  .. no detail..  even display is not so good... performence wise good.

"
"

  It's awesome,it's best camera is very pro and it feels like a premium phone because it is a premium phone awesome pubg performance and awesome charging ,fastest infact.would definitely recommend to everyone

"
"

  Amazon is cheating with name of sales it is cheap Oppo mobile. Poor display. Even no body will not like to purchase at the cost 10000.Mobile is manufactured by oppo india.

"
"

  Nice design. Blue marble is splendid in looks. Im using 12gb version which is fast as hell. Multitasking is hasslefree. Camera is just Ok.  12Mp camera is good in daylight. Macro is crap.

"
"

  Absolutely fabulous device. I was sceptical about the camera but it turned out to be great. phone feels so much premium in hands and you will love the heptic feed back.

"
"

  Smooth and fast processor, good UI , battery draining is fast in normal usage but it's fast charged so managed well.  Camera quality is not upto the mark but overall good experience.  Fingerprint system is also good.

"
"

  Very fast delivery just in 16days lol. Camera is too poor don't buy. Thought to cancel order at first. Took too much time to deliver. They didn't have stock in india still took orders. Phone is good not very premium.

"
"

  OnePlus will never disappoint, this is the best phone for an average user. Not a gaming phone, but will handle almost all top end games.

"
"

  Happy with the product . It's worth the money. Only drawback s no separate port for earphone .

"
"

  Camera üì∏ quality is poor üëé, sometimes display showing blurred while switching to video frount camera and display issues

"
"

  battery life is not that good.battery life could be better via software update. else a good compact mobile for everyday use

"
"

  not expected this from oneplus, battery draining very fast, mobile will get heat up while recording video, average camera, I'm using one plus 6t which is very good. very poor Nord complete no no.

"
"

  It's the real best for the customer who expect the price if RS.27999....Trust me this phone is awesome like other phone...Within a day of use I got an updateSound and camera are the beast

"
"

  Battery drains quickly5 to 6 hours if Network ConnectedGood PerformanceGood cameraNo lagging for gameInternet speed is highUI goodOutlook is nicepremium look

"
"

  Value for money.. excellent UI.. as always expected from one +. Primary cam and secondary back cam is good but other two just no use.. front cam is good for selfie lovers..  battery charging is very fast..

"
"

  Worst product. Rendomly reboot issue. You may lost your all important data. Poor customer service by one plus customer care

"
"

  Battery life is ok you have to charge twice a day.Camera is ok not good if u r camera user don't buy this .OS is good one more thing u can't even watch you tube on HD , ITS NOT ALLOWED by the developers.

"
"

  Camera is the worst part of this phone. It think even a 10k phone will have better image quality than this phone. But overall I'm pretty much impressed with this Phone except for the camera which is straight garbage

"
"

  Fingerprint is very fast ....Battery gets charged within an hour and lasts for almost a day on normal usage....The flagship 48MP is just the best highlight of this phone....

"
"

  Fast and vivid. One hr 0 to 100 fast charging. Like it.

"
"

  Good product the only disadvantage is that u cannot use a memory card nor normal headphones u need to have bluetooth one.

"
"

  Firstly I thought 2mp 2mp camera is just show off but Oneplus nord is extending in camera as well as processor part its a equivalent to Snapdragon 835

"
"

  1 Battery life bad2 Camera quality both bad/good3 Slow motion record bad4 Super dart üéØ charging awesome5 One plus nord Not best in this price segments

"
"

  ¬†Camera quality is not good,  automatically get reset and all data and photos erase. Battery life average. And I am so disappointed about camera when I  captured at night

"
"

  ¬†Camera is good ‚ù§Ô∏è I loved it... Face unlock is so fast... No heating problem... Camera is cool ... To take vedios it's cool 4.5/5... Gaming 95%...Over all 4.5/5...

"
"

  Overall phone quality is good at this price. But prior this I was using oneplus 5 I found camera quality of that phone more clear and superior than this. Anyway oneplus always rocks...

"
"

  Camera is not good, 2mp depth camera is worst, but still you will fall in love with nord because of its oxygen os, 90hz refresh rate, superb display, overall great phone except cameras

"
"

  ¬†Waste of money return it now

"
"

  Not properly üì∑ cameras results in front side at night time , And battery drain too much. Later reading fingers

"
"

  Brilliant DisplayAwesome Charging speedExcellent qualityValue for money.Thanks Amazon and OnePlus.

"
"

  Restarts automatically, sms opening will take 12 to 15 sec for each massage and not at all good. 12gb/256 gb i have opted but useless.

"
"

  Simply Amazing! But improvement needed in Camera segment

"
"

  Over all good product butWhere is my pre book gift

"
"

  Nord have magical reset feature. Which can erase your all data without taking your permission,  and all this happened when your phone is in your pocket. Oneplus shame on you.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader goodBattery life not enough for whole day  if use the camera for picture or vedio shooting it will be dry after 3 or 4 hrs.Camera quality good.Hotspot disconnect frequently....

"
"

  Don't buy this phone..got this phone a week ago it has multiple problems the camera takes time to get started and cant make the video..when visited the service station these people ask to keep the phone for a week

"
"

  M just loving it. It's camera is getting better with updates.And nothing to say about oxygen is. Just a killer thing in this price range. Hardcore gamers would really love this device. This deal should not be left

"
"

  This phone is amazing,not only has it got the perfect blend of features for the price but also doesn't skip on the build quality,it's a great way of joining the OnePlus family,an incredibly easy phone to recommend

"
"

  Bettery and front cam not good

"
"

  Product is good...but Amazon is worst. Worst service. OnePlus should change there selling partner to Flipkart.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is Awesome  but battery drain fast . Camera quality goodGood work one pluse team for this phone

"
"

  Amazing Phone, battery life and multiple apps can be used, no hanging at all, very happy... Boss of All

"
"

  Feels premium, though the price is reasonable, worth it!

"
"

  Got my Nord today..so far it's good...I used redmi phones so far..this one is cool ..

"
"

  Camera quality as expected and battery life higher than my other phones overall good product by 1+

"
"

  One plus nord looks good,but I received defect mobile.üò°,but I received replacement, it's working good no issues.

"
"

  Super phone.... At this price... Camera the best ... Battery could be more better.  But for me it's fine....

"
"

  After 17 days use display complaint

"
"

  Display tint issues in low brightness to purple/green. Overall white looks yellowish in this phone. When u pay 30k u dont want to experience such things and hear no update from company. Do not fall for the looks.

"
"

  + Looks+ Display+ Processor+ Fingerprints, Face Unlock+ Storage 256GB- Camera(Both) too bad (except outside daytime)- Battery draining too fast- Not Value for Money

"
"

  Very  worst battery life,will drain faster i charging 4hrs once , battery is not coming 4hrs only ,very bad ever experience I had sittttt......Amazon given defect phone or more only is like that I don't know.....

"
"

  Amazing product good service

"
"

  Am not Happy with the battery back up. But charging Speed id good..you have to charge  before you leave office...Hope this will be fixed by OnePlus in future update

"
"

  poor quality phone,poor service from amzon,this phone is not able to load whatsapp and facebook..havent expected this type of service from amzon and this type of product from oneplus

"
"

  Awesome at this rate and this is best product in this range

"
"

  Not satisfied with camera,it's worst and seems like 10k budget mobile cam.Only Marketing with no quality in mobile

"
"

  Phone is awesome as expected, but the battery time feeling very low..

"
"

  Pathetic Battery life. You have to literally stand next to the plugged charger as Battery drains in few hours of usage.

"
"

  As per the price quality is good.. If ur not so technical u cannot find the problem which is minor.. Overall camera, battery n touch sensitivity very good. Go for it without any second option

"
"

  Camera is the absolute worst that I've seen in any phone till date. Shouldn't have gone by the brand name at all. Totally regret buying this piece.

"
"

  Everything in this phone is very poor 12gb ram not equal to 12 gb ram very. I almost lost my money but don't waste your.Look other mobile available in this range.

"
"

  Smooth phone ... Really amazing performance... But battery back up.. and activating google pay with airtel sim is not all possible in this phone.. So airtel users please be cautious while purchasing this model .

"
"

  Extraordinary Performance and worthy for 30K.....Never seen such mobile with these specifications in the low cost..... Good performance in all the way like camera, fingerprint, sound performance etc.,.....

"
"

  looking very good , 5G new smart phone.Service very good

"
"

  Very goodFast charging it's fast charging looking very good colours wood packaging and good ke charger

"
"

  Good phone in this range camera quality is good, Battery life is fine, warp charging is also fast, 3.5mm headphone jack slot is not available so it's not good rest is fine.

"
"

  Overall I'm not satisfied with this low quality one plus Nord... except this Nord series I love one plus...

"
"

  Good product .....  Processor speed not up to the mark

"
"

  ¬†Battery backup is very less and cell was hang more in the working hours.

"
"

  No basic features like multiple sms forward.No seperate lock for screen and Apps.No face lock for apps.No numerical search for sharing and forwarding.Dint expect this from one+

"
"

  Phone is decent .... I'm facing issue . Middle of call it's automatically disconnecting airpods , where as for media it's working fine but middle of calls blutooth pods automatically disconnecting ...

"
"

  Badass phone with Badass specificationsBattery life and charging time is superbBlue colour looks way better than Black, considering its OnePlus - it's definitely worth the money.

"
"

  Very slow finger print readingOver heat exhaustionCamera is not goodBad battery backup lifeBetter to go with Redmi or Realme

"
"

  Tried my hands on an android phone after 5 years, and absolutely loved it . Apart from the delay in delivery thru Amazon's end which did cause the only disappointment. Rest assured this product is power packed!

"
"

  battery drains terribly fast even on very minimal usage like normal calls.There is a need of charging the phone twice to thrice a day ....and the screen gets heated up even on using the phone for 30 mins.

"
"

  Great device,Only mono speaker.Charging is awesome.üì∑ of rear and front are GreatFor gaming is best phone

"
"

  I don't think Amazon wants to replace defective product. They give different reasons to justify themselves. Amazon will have to learn respecting customers. The low rating goes to Amazon and Birds display issue.

"
"

  Getting green tint display issue in dark mode. Asked amazon to replace my phone. Looks like Oneplus not serious to do quality check that's why most of the customer getting green tint issue..

"
"

  Phone is good but it get too much heat when we put in for charging which can damage the phone

"
"

  Writing review after 1 and half montThis device is quite good in this rangeBut many bugs are there which are to be fixed but OnePlus fixing the bugs by software updates

"
"

  Not good product. Samsung M51 is much better than wasting money on this Chinese product

"
"

  Phone is good, but battery charge is taking more time. Missing one plus dialer and messaging app. O really good phone.

"
"

  Didn't meet expection being from one plus, very poor. So many drawbacks, couldn't mention all here.

"
"

  Phone is not able to connect to 4G network. I have complained to customer support and on 15 Sep they promised to rectify but even after 3 days there has been no recitification of this serious defect,

"
"

  Camera 10/10 , performance 10/10, display 10/10, sound 9/10 , design 10/10 everything is perfect üëå

"
"

  The mobile phone is quite good and handy to use. The disply is not bad at all as their are so much rumors going on for disply. But back camera zoom and battery backup is not up to the mark.

"
"

  Best android phone in 5G and delivered within 48 hours

"
"

  Good phone with 5 gValve for money

"
"

  Even 512 MB mobile work faster than Nord, automatically reboot while using teams call and outlook.

"
"

  the phone is so smoothcamera quality is very crystal and clearthough it has one speaker but the sound comparison to other phones is far better than any single speaker phone1+ is lit!!!!!!!!!!

"
"

  It's feels just ordinary 15k - 20k price smartphone.. I didn't feel as OnePlus.

"
"

  The overall phone is impressive, I have not found any lag so far.After the latest updates camera performance have been improved.If you look forward to buy your first one Plus Device than go for it.

"
"

  Nord on the whole is a good one to buy, if you don't mind the picture quality. Also the battery is draining faster than my 5T phone even though it's of a higher capacity.

"
"

  Phone got heated like fire and battery draine very fast , I would like to suggest not to buy this, bad luck.

"
"

  Bright ness and display is not to the OnePlus standard,blue or green tint Exists,overall it's price shuld have been 25k with the standard

"
"

  Heating issue's , device gets easily heated when you're using it for more than 30 minutes , not with just heavy apps but also with medium apps ,i hope 1 plus will fix the issue in their next update.

"
"

  Fingerprint performs good and battery capacity is ok not much higher for this rate ,camera quality is too bad.the image stabilization is bad in back camera ..if ur looking for camera sure don't buy this phone

"
"

  Camera qulity, battery life, fingerprint sensor, etc are performing very well. Phone is very handy. Bluetooth ptoblem is there, when ever you connect to bluetooth headset it gets disconnected again and again.

"
"

  Volte not working in this mobile. Both sim not working in this mobile. Jio sim frequently got disconnected. Network connection problem is also there. It is a wastage of money to purchase this mobile hand set.

"
"

  More than waste, i have sold my nord within 7 days.Don't purchase it , Its camera quality is too bad

"
"

  Screen disturbance within 24hrs.

"
"

  Very smart phone in good range

"
"

  Bluetooth is not getting discover on a brand new device. System has been update once connected with wifi. Is this an issue or anything i need to verify?

"
"

  Amazon sent it at the earliest. Everything is brilliant except camera. And an memorable unboxing experience.

"
"

  Very much budget friendly product from OnePlus . Flexible display and very less screen enabling time. Good battery capacity. Camera can be further improved. Overall good product.

"
"

  Very nice phone with transparent silicon cover included. The packing was very elegant but camera is a bit extra bright which makes your pic look fake. Also it is thick from sides

"
"

  Good mobile at reasonable rates by one plus

"
"

  Writting a review after 1 month of usage little bit disappointed with pictures taken in night or in low light otherwise it is good as it mentioned already midbudget phone quality is also in middle.

"
"

  fingerprint is fast battery life is just okey nd camera quality is quite fine....but i recieved warp adaptor but the data cable isn't supporting warp charging...data cable is defective üòëüòëüòë

"
"

  Overall its a good phone. Not a flagships level.Ram management is good, no lag's,am using 12gp variant but experience is not good while playing pubg üòîcamera's good not very good.

"
"

  This is a best midrange phone  best camera and sound effect is okay nord performance is excellent amazing phone i recommend this phone budget friendly phone premiaum look mobile everything is superüëç

"
"

  Network issue while playing garena freefire... totally lost.gamers not suppose to buy this mobile

"
"

  Nice phone

"
"

  Battery drain is high....battery is consuming power while i didnt use the phone....battery  is consuming 5% on my sleep...i want to charge my phone 2 times on a day...if the battery is improve,nord is superb

"
"

  Phone is excellent but the only problem I face is the battery issue it drains quickly it hardly last 12 hrs when i charge my phone 100% and when kept on standby my battery starts draining

"
"

  I just want to say that One plus has disappointed me like never before. The camera SUCKS. WHAT KIND OF A QUALITY ARE YOU GUYS DELIVERING! Never buying a one plus again.

"
"

  Battery is draining fast as of now. Camera is not bad at all. Don't know what people are complaining about.

"
"

  Best Mid Range King...

"
"

  Writing this review after 2 months of use..an  amazing seamless experience..no hangs, no heating, no software issues. Connectivity is smooth. Overall a superb buy at this price.

"
"

  It's nice product  and perform is very good , look are very calssic , but I have facing the display issue in dark mode , and  camera is good but not excellent one (it's give Little disappointment)

"
"

  Nice phone, value for money.But disappointed about the camera quality.Makes the images too soft.If you're looking for good camera quality than this is not the phone u should buy.

"
"

  After almost a month's use, i feel altogether it's worth it. The fingerprint reader is smooth and fast. I feel like the battery could have been a bit more better. Camera is good as well for what it's worth.

"
"

  Well my ist 1+ phone got it on 6Aug. So far everything is good little bit improvement in cam. Needed .Thats it for now.Will update after some time.Also their is no display tint issue in my unit.

"
"

  The battery back up is extremely bad. What is the solution? Is there any possible way to return the phone? After investing 30000 there is no profit from the bettery point of view.

"
"

  Was having OnePlus 6t before buying this .  Felt like degreded after shifting to Nord . One good thing about it is lite weight n may b better camera. Just purchased as a OnePlus follower

"
"

  Liked the design, performance, picture quality etcJust 1 upgrade was needed for 5 stars i.e Battery 4500mph at 28K

"
"

  It's frequently rebooting and many apps are not working I didn't expect this from oneplus. It's very disappointing.

"
"

  Totally in love with my phone. In this range I think this phone is the best. Better features nice look. Battery lasts long. Camera is good way else you need ü•∞üòò

"
"

  Overall best product at less prize. I have never seen at this cost of one plus mobile.I‚Äôm happy to buy this awesome mobile.Thank you Amazon for Deliver before time.

"
"

  It is not good mobile get very hot when internet is running many time switched off due very hot it may blost if you can change the mobile please change it I am get sacred.

"
"

  Very very nice product by OnePlus under 30k.Excellent phone under 30k.It is a 0hone of complete package.

"
"

  Mobile super butAmazon delivery wrost most slow delivery I have mobile book 30 July but I have received 19th Aug 20 days dealayCustomer service don't help any queries... Wrost service

"
"

  Everything in this phone is perfect. Under 30k it gives everything one can ask for..

"
"

  Well it's aoverall package everyone will at apoint show some error and point to cons but the actuall fact is that the phone comes with reference to the needs of the genuine user and it is best in segment .

"
"

  Awesome product. Good network . Net speed is very good. Smooth experience . Both front and back cameras are very good . Display is great. Mobiles looks nice. Back camera 4k CINE video  is amazing

"
"

  Worst battery, 3rd class camera , display is also not good as described, total waste of money, just like android one mobiles , cheap

"
"

  I'm not satisfied with the battery performance because drains if you use it continuously for two hour. But is has very fast warp charger you can charge it anyway. Overall awesome Phone.

"
"

  Misbehave while nothing did.automtically factory reset and take 3 hours for reseting..

"
"

  Battery is worse

"
"

  I bought 8+128 version on sale for 26500/- not disappointed with the product , decent one , you can go for it üòä

"
"

  Fingerprint response good but camera quality and battery life is not good as expect from oneplus.

"
"

  Very smooth to use.....but battery life is not as expected...that should be improve...camera quality is too good...no headphone jack.Now the phone is getting hang and Bluetooth connectivity issues too

"
"

  Nothing great except good speed.Same fearures available in lower prices.

"
"

  Overall the phone is very good. Performance, Camera and Software all good only problem I face with this device is the Display tint issue otherwise its a perfect phone

"
"

  I have to charge twice a day though I'm a moderate user,Camera works good with GcamNo notification light, No 3.5mm jack both these things should have been there

"
"

  Everything is excellent. I really liked each and every aspect of it.Only battery drains little faster but the charging is super fast...

"
"

  Excellent phone, value for every penny,Buy 12 GB 256 GB.Onyx grey color is awesome.

"
"

  It seems like a cheap heavy phone... It works okay though.... Interface not exciting like the old oneplus

"
"

  Good phone .worth for the hype .but there is a slight tint but that is not noticeable ....camera is soo good to say ...it is not bad as said in the reviews...go for it without a second thought..

"
"

  A pink tint on tight side I hope one plus will solve it but I'm disappointed with tint tint appears when brightness below 25% in dark mode and at incognito mode all dark areas at right side....!

"
"

  Heating issue & Camera is not that much good rest everything is okGood to have product !!Not Must needed product have lots of other option is also available in the market

"
"

  Received my phone on same day..overall phone is good..Good display but camera is not as marketed.No where close to oneplus 8 camera.. hopefully software update will resolve the camera quality.

"
"

  Depth Camera didn't use in any condition, and also OIS didn't worked in night photography, and ultra wide selfi camera and macro lens is totally waste. I think OnePlus should use ultra wide for macro shot

"
"

  Observed over heating with just 20 min call., With out heavy usage like gaming. Battery draining fast. Camera clarity not as expected.Feared to use the phone due to over heating.

"
"

  Battery performance is ver poor . it doesn;t last for even a day at normal use

"
"

  Superb mobile i like it...Planning to take 1 more OnePlus Nord mobile phone to gift my family in future..

"
"

  Camra quality is a very bad... OnePlus nord phone is very unsatisfied..if any purchase nord only OnePlus name...very unsatisfied phone.. camera quality very very bad

"
"

  Everything is good ...but issue in operating games and Facebook app ...Speed of processor is not at par as per price ...u can experience same speed in OnePlus 3T....

"
"

  Dont buyInstalled amoled is terrible, i am in contact with Amazon to return itit was my first one plus device and it sucks i am really dissatisfied

"
"

  Well good but battery life and camera is not so good if you are taking it for camera forget it otherwise awesome ui awesome speed awesome everything

"
"

  Although the battery life is not extraordinary, the charging speed compensates it with its excellent speed.Fingerprint reader is good.I'm not a big fan of cameras, it does good enough for me.

"
"

  Its really cool phone camera is bad even worse than low budget phone for indoor photographyIf u doesnt give that importance for camer and loves the feel of oxygen os just grab on it i just loved it

"
"

  Awesome mobile.. Great experience... Battery backup great... After full charge I was used it 32 hours continuously.... specially micro camera is superb.. Those who like photography this phone is best....

"
"

  The product is good camera quality is excellent fingerprint sensor works very fast but as oneplus provides USBtype C connector in this product they didn't provide it but overall the product is good

"
"

  Awesome phone something I have to say that I am using OnePlus brand phone from 3t,5,5t,6,6t and now finally nord always a good experience from the company's oxygen os to all specs perfect phones for all.

"
"

  Battery backup is very poor just only for calls it is not even working for 8 hours. And I complaintes Amazon in my last day of replacement but they refused to sort it out. Very poor response from Amazon.

"
"

  Fingerprint is fast,battery life decent,camera quality is good not best.Compact size and light weight.Display superb.Good processor.Gorilla glass 5 is good.

"
"

  A great ram management with good processor and camera set-up

"
"

  OnePlus Nord must buy phone ..cost effective.. battery life is good. Good one in the range of 25k to 30k..

"
"

  One of the best out there but if you are a dark mode fan and details matter, DO NOT BUY this phone until the screen tint issue is solved. It's the only drawback of this quality device

"
"

  Not happy with mobile after 2 months usagebattery life goes worse ü§ßcharging time increased ü•¥network issue always üòµphone getting heat while 30 mins gaming ü•µ

"
"

  Buy it for Quality most of the features are 2nd best when compared to flagships some of them are top notch..ex display superb

"
"

  The best phone with this price tag.

"
"

  Phone is amazing.. superb build quality.. premium look.. leave the negative reviews.. it's a value for money product..

"
"

  Good phone on that budgetCamera quality is not better don't expect much

"
"

  Above average camera. Very good display. Very handy phone. Tint issue is a small issue. Average battery life. Best software experience. Final conclusion. Best product at this price segment

"
"

  Good phone. A first midrange phone for me. Tint issue? Yes. Noticeable? No.Camera is fantastic, GCam support is best. Stock camera also good.

"
"

  Camera Quality is awesome, Internet speed in OnePlus Nord is fast as compared to other 4G phone. Voice calling quality is good. Overall OnePlus Nord is a best quality phone.

"
"

  Overall a good performance but price is little bit higher

"
"

  Amazing.. Top notch design and performance.. camera quality is good.. battery life could have been better.. so have given 4/5 .. rest 5/5..

"
"

  tha next leval phone..finger print reder is awasome camera quality is next leval super speed cell value for moni but battery life is not gud....sound qulity is very gud..phone style is super..

"
"

  Overall it is great in comparison with other samsung phones in same budget...

"
"

  It's good phone but OnePlus Nord could be better in all waysI would recommend only the UI of this device in this price rangeIf u want specs then there are better phone than the OnePlus Nord.

"
"

  Unboxing - adapter with type 'c' cord.  Phone cover - silicone  OnePlus stickers+red cable cardHighly impressed.Phone that's equipped with all high end specifications, light in weight.

"
"

  Camera quality has to be improved. Definitely it is not matching with the quantity it has built.Facing tint issue in display while locking. Any software update to fix the same will be handy.

"
"

  Performance wise the phone is very good. Works smooth and can handle mulitple running apps quite well without crashing/lagging. Camera is not up to the mark but yes its good. Macro lens is just useless.

"
"

  12GB/256GB Varient- After using 15 days. It's Awesome phone. Fingerprint reader is very fast. Camera quality is Awesome.Only problem is Battery drains bit fast.All okk. People go for it üëçüëç

"
"

  Battery draining very fast and camera was not good.After the update camera become even worse.And fingerprint sensor also not so fast.I'd like to return the product.

"
"

  Awesome handset

"
"

  Batwry life so bad and network issue.. one plus should work a better ..I have lot of expectations but I m not satisfied

"
"

  Fingerprint is working smooth.Battery life is excellent.Best camera in this price range

"
"

  It is Good

"
"

  The oxygen os is very fresh every user gets a good experience with it.The main thing which I want to highlight is the performance.The performances is absolutely mind blowing.

"
"

  Rear camera is not good as aspected , battery backup also not good at all ,these two things are more important for Indian people , it's my first OnePlus phone but seriously it totally disappointed me .

"
"

  OnePlus NordThis an excellent phone,works with Qualcomm snapdragon 765G 5G ,and The performance is good, camera quality is awesome,and this phone you can pretty much everything u could ask for...

"
"

  Poor battery backup and camera quality not upto the mark. Waiting for the replacement by Amazon - we'll see if it's the product that I received defective or the production of Nord is not upto the mark.

"
"

  At first. E mera first OnePlus phone. Oxygen os is lob ‚ù§Ô∏è. Battery in 90hz is should be much better but it's ok with 30w warp charge. And display is mind blowing..

"
"

  Poor performance and the build quality is sub standard. Bends like iPhone 6 plus

"
"

  I miss the call recording feature. But overall it's a good product

"
"

  Excellent product! Good battery Life, excellent camera quality.

"
"

  My experience with oneplus nord is very good,Better battery life.Good design.No defects with my varient

"
"

  It's a quality product from OnePlus at this price point. It has that premium feel to it and doesn't look like a cheap phone

"
"

  VALUE FOR MONEY8gp ram 256 romBest mobile but battery life is low1hr 25% battery down'

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  My mobile green tint issue

"
"

  Very fast and as expected as good as other phones of onplus.

"
"

  This fon is so so amazing. Its size very much compatible to use by single hand.  Its punch hole camera look really fine. I truly love the fon in every aspect.  P.s  I am OnePlus user since 4 years. üòç

"
"

  Amazing phone. Couldn't have expected a better camera from OnePlus. Full charge within an hour. Excellent performance. Awesome look. In short, don't go for a 2nd thought in buying this phone

"
"

  Over all it good but camera quality is not good. So please focus in camera quality.

"
"

  Must purchase its good in simple words I can say that cost of the product is valuable

"
"

  Completely unsatisfied with the product, phone got hang on just the 3rd day and after this it started everyday

"
"

  Iam purchase OnePlus Nord 12Gb Ram 256 internal model... Unexpected performance this device I was surprised.ultra smooth experience..best phone this price segment

"
"

  Everything is osm but when i connect hotspot to my laptop my phone is reaching high temperaturesThis is the only problem i have noticed but for a regular use the phone is osm

"
"

  One of the best phone. Super fast and touch is so nice that feel amazing. It has 8GB RAM so working effortlessly and very fast. No comparable in this segment. Best in this segment.

"
"

  First time use oneplus device value for money best deal

"
"

  Disappointed. Not upto OnePlus standard

"
"

  Battery backup is very very bad,so i request don't buy the mobile

"
"

  Purchase it at ‚Çπ25473 Amazing phone recommend to buy purchase it.

"
"

  While playing pubg network suddenly it comes connection error.. and you will be out from the game.. you have to restart the game for 2 or 3 times than only you can play the game.. very disappointing..

"
"

  Battery backup is not as per expectations.Budget phone from OnePlus.Cammera is also ok.

"
"

  I received this product which stop working within a week visited the one plus store and sought refund

"
"

  Over all not goodWant to return back to company ASAP.Please contactI used 5T before

"
"

  Awosme product in this price in IndiaReally quality is very good product is excellent.Recommended to buy more.

"
"

  Battery backup issue only

"
"

  Very poor build and one of the worst camera I have ever seen in the price. Getting hanging frequently

"
"

  One plus has disappointed me with this version.. poor camera quality is the major reason.. image processing itself is slow.  If the hardware is great as they claim, they need to work on the software.

"
"

  oneplus should have gave one geniune camera. instead giving a crap like macro lens .except camera  performance of the device is good.also facebook, messenger apps comes pre-installed(bloatware)

"
"

  Issue is Only when you give Hotspot to Other devices..... It's getting disconnected Again & Again......Hotspot & Tethering is not good......I think it's very poor performance in  29999 category phone

"
"

  Received the phone with a black particle on the screen behind the screen guard. As it was behind the guard I couldn't remove it and it was constantly seeking my attention as I was operating my phone.

"
"

  Front camera is useless. It's a fake dual front camera. The image quality is ver bad. Not satisfied with front camera one Plus should improve it otherwise it's fame is going to vanish soon.

"
"

  Overall awesome mobile phone under 30000 price.Performance is amazing. Camera quality is also good. You can compare with other mobiles with same price ranges. Good product of oneplus.

"
"

  In good light the camera is really superb...but low light camera quality is not that good...apart from that phone is good....I haven't faced any heating issue or low battery life issues yet

"
"

  Never disappointed üí™

"
"

  Phone slow. Automatically switch off

"
"

  The flash lights are epic failure!!!Apart from this everything is fine......I cannot believe, they concluded a low valued flash lights....

"
"

  At this price point Nord is just ok...12/256 gb variant at 28499(including discount) is a great buy...but you can consider for other devices with better performance at same price.

"
"

  Good product with premium looks and performance but battery camera need to improve

"
"

  If you don't care about gaming and micro camera then go for it .. because software experience as they said is smooth and Amazing with very good battery.

"
"

  Not worth for the price..  hv other good mobile . Camera zero ü•ä

"
"

  Camera is average. Rest everything is acceptable, nothing great.

"
"

  Best smartphone in the segment. No display issue. No green tint issue. Everything is just perfect.

"
"

  Battery backup is less compared to my old mi phone (4000mah) which i was using before. But overall good phone & performance also good.camera is also good. If it is 20k to 25k then it is more worthy.

"
"

  As of now very frustrating, as Received the defective product yesterday and battery is draining so quickly in just 4 to 5 hours after full charge. Let's see what will Amazon do in my case.

"
"

  I like everything , if front camera should be a little smaller than it would be much better ... I like its colour overall well balance phone ... Very fast charger mobile

"
"

  I loved d camera, speacially it's storage, figersensor it's superb, battery life good and most important it's classy. I totally loved d product within my budget

"
"

  Not good product.. I just perched few days above and speaker voice are blur and not getting proper voice.. even never find any nearest oneplus services centre..

"
"

  Awesome phone from oneplus

"
"

  Such a worst product.Entire in my life.Batterys sucks.Front camera is too much poor in  low light.Don't buy this  until you don't have problems with battery backup and cameras.

"
"

  Macro camera is very poor and the color is very different from the original. There is a green tint in low brightness in the screen. Not worth the money. The call drops in VoWifi.

"
"

  This review was posting after using the mobile for one month and I will definitely say this is the best budget phone and try to buy 12/256 variant if you are a photography lover.

"
"

  Nice one..got the delivery today...No tinting issues all works well.Little bit bulky

"
"

  Everything is great except the rear camera.The screen is the smoothest and gives you a premium feel.

"
"

  It's a good mobile....but not upto the mark....after using mobile for one week this was not upto the One Plus Mark... Back Camera Performance Is Worst...

"
"

  Totally worth of money.They said they delivered.Just amazing.

"
"

  It's hanging. Normal mobile far better than this.üò°ü§¨

"
"

  It's one of the best segments in one plus.I don't think you can get anything better than this in 30k. Best for its value. Plz ignore the bad reviews. No one is 100 % perfect. Just go for it!!

"
"

  Simply awesome in every area. Battery life needs to be optimised. Below are my rating for phone out of 5.Camera: 5Display: 5Battery: 4Charging :5Overall performance: 4

"
"

  The battery life sucks from day 1 . It drains quickly on standby that's the main issue. The display quality is nice.The front ban enhances the image too muchI am returning this product.

"
"

  Battery life is not good , fingerprints sensor is not good and plus i am facing a lot Bluetooth issue ....not expected From OnePlus i hope Amazon and OnePlus will provide some solutions for it!!!!!

"
"

  The Battery charging with the charger received with the mobile is very slow. It takes 3 hrs to fully charge the battery. Whereas with other one plus nord charger mobile gets charged within an hour.

"
"

  If Camera quality can be omitted, rest of the phone is smooth and fast. Given the price, this can be the best value phone. Although if taking photos is your concern, maybe go for pixel 4a

"
"

  This was a complete waste , my phone is having netwrok issue, the sim is not working in this phone and many people are facing this issuw and one plus is having no software update for this

"
"

  Screen quality and touch sensitivity is excellent

"
"

  Phone is nice,smooth opration ,camera is good browsing speed is normal not flagship but battery performance is very very poor so finally I am order for replace this product.

"
"

  Excellent mobile only issue with Bluetooth as it get disconnected automatically. But it will pair again. Everything else is above expectation.

"
"

  Battery life not good, even without  gaming. Also have heating issues when you watched cont. 10-15 min. Youtube or use the camera.Camera quality also not good as expacted.

"
"

  Good parformancebut some compromisation by OnePlus with respect to other OnePlus flagship one....Love to use oxigen os....

"
"

  Good overall. Camera is very good improvement. But still can't all the best flagship . But definitely competes in that class of phones

"
"

  Battery life is worst comparing any other new phone it's just drains like in 6 to 8 hours. Waste of money

"
"

  Not bad good phone for daily users and battery little drain.overall 4.5 and display very good better than other company fingerprint reader little slow

"
"

  Phone gets hanged during video call and gets switched off...... major problem i am facing from 5 to 6 days otherwise phone is working excellent...i think one plus will resolve this problem shortly

"
"

  All are good in this phone except automatic call recorder not avilable and manual recorder is wrost of one feature which alarming before recording.one plus please update the call recorder feature.

"
"

  One Plus Nord is really pretty much you could ask for at this price point. As I was an early bird and pre booked Nord, I got a lot of merchandise with the phone with some additional minimal price.

"
"

  Fast, nice design, wide angle selfie is very good, camera is good, display is good, fingerprint scanner is fast.Camera doesn't capture moving objects.Gaming graphics not upto the mark.

"
"

  Best camera. Best Amoled Display. 30W wrap Charge. Good battery Backup. It‚Äôs 5G ready.90Hz refreshing rate.Best in segment.Value for Money.Must Buy.Oneplus NORD‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Recently buy  8gb 128 gb mobile was excellent but blutooth is not connecting  so many Times tried but con't connecting the device  in future update solve the blutooth problem as soon as possible..

"
"

  Doesn't recognize the SIM .. whereas basic functionality of a phone is to use a sim card.. one plus brand out does itself and forgets to cater to basic functionality.battery drains out like water.

"
"

  The phone is excellent but the display can be problem especially the blurs at night which is for real. Till now it's been ok but some times it hangs out of the blue, overall rating 3.5/5

"
"

  Till now no problem. They should also provide port jack and headphones. Sometimes voice issue can be there. So just check loudspeaker once. Otherwise its working great

"
"

  Very poor battery life

"
"

  Awesome and by best price 5g NORD one plus.i love one plus.

"
"

  Nyc mobile...and fast processing..good quality camera..only one problem battery drain very fast...

"
"

  Very nice camera,fast, clear,user friendly and yet to use video recording. battery seems good, improvement in battery life can be done. Awesome features.goodluck for new buyer.

"
"

  Great phone at this price point

"
"

  Poor network connection, can't play online games like pubg freefire. Average battery life but charging very fast. Performance is good

"
"

  Camera is not as great as OnePlus other phones.Battery life and fingerprint sensor are better.

"
"

  This is beast at this Price Better battery Life, Display, Experience But low light Camera Quality must be improved..and It's getting Better Day by day by new updates from oneplus... Just Love it.

"
"

  Macro camera not works as it should, even you can take better photo without choosing macro option.Camera quality not like a 30k phone, if we compare it with 15000 phone both are same.

"
"

  Its pretty good but the battery could be better its drains faster on comparision of other phones so  i think that should be better and in next update this prblm could resolved and camera is good.

"
"

  Finger print reader is very fast..Battery life is goodRear camera is GoodBut front camera is not shot good images at nightBut overall good phone at this price...

"
"

  Fantastic Product and true to the One Plus quality and features offerings !

"
"

  Nice performance

"
"

  Amazing quality, very nice color, performance is great, value for money

"
"

  The best mobile in my life . A very good change from IOS to OXYGEN OS. Very good value for money.

"
"

  It's worst ever phone made by one plus.I was talking to someone and then automatic it turned off after that I turned on but it is still turning on since an hour

"
"

  Battery performance is not upto the mark.Camera is also not that good according to one plus standards.It's better to go for RealMe 7 or 7 Pro in much lesser price.

"
"

  In india autocall recording or call recording not available in oneplus nord  and its is main problem in this one

"
"

  Only 1problem is that when u pull down menu in lock screen n back lock opens any1can open lock like that.

"
"

  This one is  the worst camera ever, ashamed of oneplus about this phone, lot of legging issue in my phone

"
"

  All is good but camera has to be little good to control light and contrast.Although it is a good device.Delivery took more time but it's ok as they gave the product as good as it is.

"
"

  The nord is just what you could ask for.It's everything packed in a single phone.The CAMERA is just so amazing and click's amazing pictures.The Fingerprint scanner is very fast

"
"

  Camera quality is very cheap ,& especially front camera is too bad ,when we click the pic photo is blurry ...also hitting problem , battery is draining too fast..... not expecting from OnePlus ,

"
"

  Fine

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is good, battery is draining so fast as expected max 4 hours of battery life, camera is better but it can be best.Battery is worstüòìüò¢

"
"

  Third class phone, empty phone is hanged even after one day of purchase.Very poor service of Amazon and they are not allowed to return the phone but showing you can return phone.

"
"

  I have purchase Two One plus Nord 1 month ago. and I am facing many problems this mobile hang and Restart automatically etc.Please don't one plus  Nord Mobile.

"
"

  After 7 weeks of usage, I could say it's a masterpiece at this price. Camera, battery and phone performance has improved since update 10.5.8. Happy using this phone.

"
"

  Good for people with Good User Experience

"
"

  Best smartphone oneplus

"
"

  Bad cameraBad battery stand byYou get a case with it which obstacle when you swipe from out to inYet to use it to talk about the tech part

"
"

  Buy redme note 8 instead..Cons1.Under performer camera2.not impressive battery lifePros1.not seen any over cheap phones.

"
"

  Pathetic phone and pathetic service from Amazon after Quality issues..

"
"

  Nice product and display quality, sound are good

"
"

  I see lot of software issues on the phone . The network connectivity hasn't picking up right . Loud speaker on call only work at times.Not satisfied with product.

"
"

  Good Product, worth buy. Had random shutdown issues in oxygen os 10.5.7 but after 10.5.8 it was fixed.Best mid range performer.

"
"

  I got my one plus bord and back side of phone and blue color is really good m satisfied with device

"
"

  Display issues plz return tha phone please accept customer service is no response!!!! I hate Amazon üò†

"
"

  Best Phone 30k. Very smooth and powerful. Display of this phone is awesome üòç

"
"

  Overall a good package ..... But lately I have been experiencing the automatic rebooting while in pocket. Read on internet that this problem is also happening to many Nord users.

"
"

  It's a good product and seller has sent the new product as per description in time

"
"

  Nice product worth buying. While booking in the boxes it was mentioned as 3 back cases will be there with product but I can see only 1 back case provided in the box

"
"

  Fairly impressed with the product.The Oxygen OS live upto your expectations even though the hardware doesn't. Lack of cases provided by OnePlus in Amazon is problem

"
"

  This mobile is hanging lighting issue suddenly switched off and switch on

"
"

  Preety good phone to but I network issue problem by which I know soon be resolved by and update otherwise price worth phone

"
"

  Moto one plus fusion is better than thisNot meet the expectations

"
"

  Bakwas.. Mobile battery is Heating.. Camera also not good.. Giving reddish and blur photos.I have complained about it.But Amazon and technicians told me battery heating is normal..

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is Awesome ...The price is also very comfortable and The mobile specifications is Awesome...12GB Ram, I'm using lots of Applications though phone is fast ...Thank you OnePlus Team

"
"

  ¬†Packing was lit, camera is good, but the thing is u need different connector for ur earphones

"
"

  Fantastic all round phone. Solid OS.I only miss the headphone jack now and then.No other regrets.

"
"

  Prosser is so worst . Camera quality is bad. I like one pluse 5 compare to one pluse  nord . Hanging in pubg.

"
"

  I bought 1+Nord on 10th October and its totally dead yesterday.Software fully crashed and Blinking Qualcomm Crashdump mode..I cheated myself by seeing false reviews

"
"

  Amazing phone. Worth every penny

"
"

  Just received the phone there is some scratches on the screen may be on screen guard

"
"

  Amazon delivery was terrific late. I ordered mobile 29 July and got on 14 aug. Mobile is very good. Camera quality is little bit disappointed.but performance is impressive.

"
"

  My first one plus phone.I'm enjoying itFast chargingAverage batteryDecent front cameraAverage back cameraDecent speed and sexy colour üòâ

"
"

  Full pasia vasool

"
"

  The beast in the best mode

"
"

  Great phone with beautiful back. Great camera and battery life is great as well. If your budget is 30000, go for it

"
"

  The phone is an all-rounder in this price range, a bit of everything. I just wish the battery was a bit more long lasting.

"
"

  1. Good display2. Good camera3. Smooth performance4. Fast charging

"
"

  Disappointed with the  build quality and main camera  tooo (it wasn't as expected to be ) speed is fine and display is awesome , there are still few bugs and I hope they will clear them in next update

"
"

  I have used it for 1 month now and camera and battery is good. Fingerprint sesnsor is also fast enough. Though I have found twice or thrice the device hanging even when it was idle for hours.

"
"

  Battery life is avg but it charge up extremely fast...... No doubt go for it

"
"

  Not satisfied with camera performance

"
"

  Excellent phone.. love it.. everything is good.. battery drains faster. Charging is also very fast..

"
"

  First 2 months working is good after that I am getting issues mobile hanging, automatically restating and blue screen error (os corrupted)  in Service Center also there is no proper  response.

"
"

  It is a good productNice cemraNice betteryValue for moneyIt is a best mobile

"
"

  Camera quality is very very poor and i can feel lagging during call of duty

"
"

  Camera quality is worst , don't buy this phone.Its not like othe one plus phones completely disappointedI want to return the product but no return is available

"
"

  Great value for money. Sleek premium look. Awesome display and good pic optimization.

"
"

  ¬†I dont know what has happened to this.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is lightning fast also the battery is good enough to last for a complete day for a moderate user and camera takes good shots just low light shots could have been improved.

"
"

  Only 3 issues in  mobile  please solve that issues1  battery draining fast2  camera is not working properly3 little bit heating Give  updates to mobile as soon as possible

"
"

  Nice product

"
"

  1.Fingerprint scanner is quite good ,2.Battery is also pretty good around 6 to 7 hours screen on time with 90hz3.camera quality is descent i think avarage but i like it

"
"

  I do not like phone as expected.Heating is so much. With a normal use, it heats so much and hard to use in .Camera quality is not up to mark as described with features.

"
"

  Really impressive

"
"

  Like-fingerprint sensor, speedy performance, light weightDislike-Battery ( not even a days backup), fragile product.

"
"

  Not buy this phone automatic switch on offff isuee when auto switch off and auto on alll data erse phone plz don't buy ..i face problem i alreday going care centers but my issue not solve.....

"
"

  Plastic quality is average.... That's the only problem which I can say about its cons.....

"
"

  Inferior performance compared to even OnePlus 6. No LED indicators, no step counter.

"
"

  Superb in 5g categories just wait for 5g to cheq performance

"
"

  Iam facing sevre problem. I can hear the people on the other side clearly whereas they are struggling to hear me.This is major issue be careful while buying this...

"
"

  Worth the price but battery could have been better... except that no cons I have found...

"
"

  Not value for money phone

"
"

  One of the best phones you can buy for this price.The chipset is pretty good, it can run through casual apps easily and can game well. Good Job Oneplus for making a budget beast. ü§üü§ü

"
"

  Fingerprint : very fast and quickbattery life : its not  a turbo charge its warp charge 3 times faster than turbo charge its really niceCamera quality  : Front camera is awesome

"
"

  Facing so many issue with one plus Nord, call recording issue, bluetooth connectivity issue, hanging issue, processer problem, battery life is not up to mark, etc.Not worth it for 30k

"
"

  Very bad experience this mobile camera not good internet speed is disconnect everytime and earphones not working maps using time totally wastage of my money

"
"

  It's a great budget phone the colour was amazing and the build quality is better at this price range

"
"

  Good batteryWorst front cameraAverage fingerprint sensorHas network issues

"
"

  Battery life so bad

"
"

  Camera quality nice

"
"

  Good product with solid performance. Display is the awesome part of it, so flawless. Loved it.

"
"

  Phone hangs with white. and red dots.. Very disappointing..

"
"

  Awesome

"
"

  Verious type of problem -Such as heating problem of mobile andCamera is bad in various segments..Oneplus , u guys pls fix this camera problem,

"
"

  Value for money....gud battery backup...gid to use...

"
"

  Extremely glitchy phone. Need to restart it atleast once a day. Keeps hanging. Lot of dropped calls.

"
"

  The phone is worth buying don't listen to the bad reviews if you want a phone a mid range phone with all of the quality like battery,camera and performance this is it ‚ô•Ô∏è

"
"

  True to its name One Olus Nord is a excellent product,and true value for money

"
"

  Product is good but not issue with network connection while playing games on phone and also speaker reconnecting problem when resume whatsapp video call after cutting audio call on network

"
"

  I would say it's so soft handling ...sad that we don't have anything in the box like tempered glass or something ..but camera is fantastic ...phone is pretty fast to use üëçoverall loved it

"
"

  The Camera Is best comparing to other phones in this Range. Smooth UI and 90hz display makes it more easy to use . Battery Backup is Good and I'm fan of fast charging speed in this phone .

"
"

  Camera is excellent. Battery Back up is low. Facing abnormal mobile Heat after taking photos.

"
"

  Great phone with good camera. Loved the color marble blue. Battery life is something which I am concerned about.

"
"

  Please don't buy yar this is worst product as usual Chinna dump piece even we are spending 30k for this usefuless.. you won't feel /get as your using a  flag ship mobile trust me

"
"

  12gm ram is looking like 6gb ram speed  very slow downloaded.Battery is good.Charging is very fast.Camera average.Phone we can use like ruf and tuf.

"
"

  Only if they have given less but better cameras, this phone would have been perfect.Nevertheless, overall experience is very good.

"
"

  Tints issue(but its normal). Camera is okayish. Gray color is looking cool. Premium feel.

  1. Camera 7/10 due to slow speed2. Battery 6/10 drains fast3. Software 10/104. Speaker  7/10Only problem is phone get heated during normal day to day use.

"
"

  Front camera quality to be Improved...

"
"

  Plus/ OnePlus phone 765 snap board performanceCons/build quality camera display average

"
"

  This is a well balanced phone with everything you need. Though Metal body would made it complete. But it's value for money and future proof as it's 5G enabled.

"
"

  Awesome Product at this  Price range .. Phone performs well is every aspect expect battery .. but one plus should start thinking about big battery Like 5k mah or 6k mah

"
"

  Battery performance is very low & poor that's why I return this mobile. I don't like this mobile.

"
"

  Came quality worst this not acceptable by one+ and battery backup is also not  good  as far I use

"
"

  Front camera is v poor. Screen light and pixels are dull.battry drains v soon. 3 times charge if using phone frequently a day. Gets warm too while use

"
"

  Huge battery drainageCamera is not upto the markLow performanceIrregular hang issueI am very disappoint with the product

"
"

  M buying  this product only for charging and camera purpose but both are not good as compare  vivo and appo provide this with almost less than half price... overall not happy with product

"
"

  Pubg grafix not support on extreme but phones with less processor than Nord support at extreme quality.Camera picture quality is not good as expected.Loved the charging speed.

"
"

  fingerprit &camera quality good.battery backup very bad...It is getting very hot during charging, even when the phones are not being used, the battery% is decreasing by itself

"
"

  Not even one week I started facing network issue in mobile, network will disappear some time when there is network in other mobiles. Approached OnePlus store but no proper help from staff

"
"

  Nice and light in weight

"
"

  Over all the mobile phone was good but only disappointed me was no headphone 3.5mm jack

"
"

  It's an Amazing Experience for Fingerprint Reader, Battery Life, Camera Quality and Performance with OnePlus Nord. Definately they launch perfect product by Every Perspective for Everyone

"
"

  Great phone ü•∞

"
"

  Display quality is not that much good as compared to one plus 6..color contrast is not that much good which one plus giving in earlier phones.. display is like using cheap phone

"
"

  fake promises by OnePlus. bought this for my friend to obtain pre-order benifits

"
"

  Over pricedNot look like premium phonePlastic frameAfter updates charging speed decreasedNo need of 4 cameras

"
"

  It's all right but can't say so good

"
"

  Liked the Device.But my screen is having green tint in maximum brightness.If I go for replacement it will take one month to get new device. That was very bad for me.

"
"

  One plus is best phone maker around at the moment. Nord is the best. You get value for your money.

"
"

  Some times automatically switches to vibration mode, call recording is not working and whenever after finishing the call it shows on the top as call updating.

"
"

  Best phone for under 30k in the market.The camera quality somehow less than compare to One Plus 7.

"
"

  Super fast delivery..Best phone if you want best display with best UI experience..

"
"

  One plus should Improve this Nord Series as a One Plus User I am Highly Disappointed with the Product...

"
"

  Camera not upto the mark.Battery is Not bad..

"
"

  Very good

"
"

  Battery life is just ok and camera could have improved also it looks perfect if the phone  length would have been shorter.But after its nice üòä

"
"

  Display and Build Quality is nice... But there is some issue in battery... Battery is draining in standby mode also... Camera is Ok not super nice...

"
"

  pls dont buy it..waste of money,one plus scarifised its quality first time ever., after 2 days usage phone got switch off automatically and shutdown completely not able to swith it on...

"
"

  Nord's display has pink tint issues on low brightness. All gray content is shown as gray-pink gradient color under low brightness. Cameras are mediocre. Everything else is good.

"
"

  Phone is awesome but it don't have auto call recording and also if you record call""your call is recorded"" voice will come while recording call it will hear by other person also

"
"

  Best phone in rate

"
"

  This is the second Oneplus Nord in the family. That itself is the best appreciation I can give. One of the best midrangers out there

"
"

  One of the Best ..Future packed phone..One of the most awaited..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è..ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞..

"
"

  First and foremost I would like to say that it feels premium, no need to fuss about plastic body and SD765G as in day to day usage you will not feel the difference as it is that we'll optimised.

"
"

  I m using from one month phone wil suddenly reboot in pocket and whole data wil exhaust..., i don't except this from one plus team., hope this issue will solve by one  plus team ASAP

"
"

  Got it delivered in 4 days. Delivery experience is osm. About the phone very happy. It has great camera. Battery life is good. Overall good purchase. HappyüòÅ

"
"

  Below average mobiles

"
"

  All good except battery life. It could have been better hope they will do it with updates

"
"

  It is not so good its hanging problem.My phone is facing network problem since we have updated

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus phone. After a day usage I would say it is one of the best mobile I ever used.

"
"

  Amazing mobile must buy it nice working and all good nice color

"
"

  Battrey life is good.Camera quality during daytime is excellent but during night the photos are not clear and noise can be seen in photos.Charging is very fast .

"
"

  the OnePlus Nord makes a solid case for itself in the midrange segmentüëåüëåüëå. It might not be perfect, but it is a good smartphone in its own right, with a bit of something for everyone

"
"

  Very worst mobile phone.  After one month mobile screen shows  Qualcomm dump crash system after downloading  the update of android.  I think that total loss of price. Valueless phone...

"
"

  The battery of phone lasts for 1 day ,and if heavy user then it will lasts for half day. Ovearall it is good in this price. But this is not oneplus flagship phone it anyone looking for.

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is a value for money smartphone has made my life stylish and easier and the experience of using it is Awesome, really it feels to next level experience... Thanks to Oneplus

"
"

  Product is working fine and battery quickly draining.

"
"

  Not sure suddenly ..after using upto 4 hours have noticed blue spot came into my display.

"
"

  Both front and back camera are poor and battery is just normal as compared to other phones.. not worth it please don't buy if you are looking it buy a performance based phone.

"
"

  In this price range this phone is not match the requirements, it must be more cheaper than today price. The main thing which ia disappointing me the size of screen and camera.

"
"

  Not a flagship but overall best budget smartphone in this price range

"
"

  Always oxygen os rockzzzzz.... Everything thing is good... But low light camera must improve...

"
"

  High range budget phone with decent chipset performance, good battery life and little above average camera performance. Overall a good buy.

"
"

  Wast of money

"
"

  Very bad experience my phone charger is not working and i have raised it to 6 time  to replace but didn't get any response from you

"
"

  I was worried about the performance but it's great. I can play all games at 2nd highest settings if not at highest . So don't worrie go for it .

"
"

  Everything is perfect except battery need to charge twice atleast in day, it needs more than 1 and half hour to charge while hotspot is on. Max 5 to 6 hr battery life with 100% charge.

"
"

  Fully disappointed with camra qualityGaming performance also averageDisplay performance superFinger print superBattery performance goodBut camra worst....

"
"

  Oneplus have tried to come up with the midrange variant but frankly it doesn't give u the oneplus feel as it gives when we use oneplus 7,8 and others the quality is somehow compromised

"
"

  Worst phone Evr I had use.. camera quality like VGA ..Most unusable camera..Face unlock work not properly in low light conditions.. please don't buy this phone.. don't waste ur money..

"
"

  One plus Nord has factory data reset it self in pocket  don't buy this phone i lost all my data in this phone it has automatically factory data reset in pocket battery life is not good

"
"

  I have network issue while Playing games and phone heats up if we go to some high settings very fast .And I face regular glitches on pubg btw that's no longer available üòÇüòÇ but still.

"
"

  Worst mobile ever Bluetooth connection issue camera picture not clear no call recording.

"
"

  Display Tint Issue.

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  After 1 month usage Except battery everything is awesome . Battery drains very fast even in 60Hz.So upcoming update let hope to see the improvement

"
"

  The phone has not met the expectation at all. Camera is the biggest disappointment. Battery life also nt that great. Over all a very bad experience

"
"

  Happy to buy

"
"

  Hanging problem

"
"

  Everything about the phone is good. Only one problem is that I received a defective Phone. The Proximity sensor is not working at all. Now I have to visit the Service center.

"
"

  Overall good at this price

"
"

  Awesome Phone...I really loved it.Only the delivery is too late with prime members also.

"
"

  Over all one plus nord mobile phone features are user friendly really good

"
"

  Everything is awesome,,,,,speed super and overall performance excellent

"
"

  ¬†It was a very good experience , mobile is very good ,each and every thing is good and also camera click by one+Nord 12gb ram 256 gb memory

"
"

  That is true review phone  all mostLight weight all camera design so goodDisplay oneplus is so good. Much better than iPhone se2020. But charging no fast and no sliw

"
"

  The overall product is GOOD but I slightly feel that it is not worth the money. The camera quality is decent but not very good. But I would say if your budget is around 28k GO FOR IT!

"
"

  Phone look is goodbut front camera is worste .Front camera look like 9000 RS mobile phone.Price is very high.So Don't go this mobile because

"
"

  Camera quality: niceBattery: 8hr screen timeCharge:1hrLooks like Premium & flagship phoneGaming: üëçOverall: good product in the market

"
"

  One Plus always give at its best and Everything always best in market by Camera, fingerprint and etc ..Happy For This one.

"
"

  Poor battery backup. I m very desappointed for battery backup.Rest all are superb

"
"

  Everything is good for NORD except White balancing and Saturation in camera. I think it isa software glitch and may corrected in upcoming updates.

"
"

  Good Deal but laging in most appand camera also not good as per one plus standard

"
"

  Battery could be better, inserting 2 SIM cards slot is tricky. Make sure to buy a case along with it.

"
"

  I am using this phone from last 20 days but the side button for on off is not working properly.It start creating problem after pressing 3-4 times it open up the phone.

"
"

  I have to say its must by Phone!!! Super Display, Super Fast,

"
"

  Great speed and features

"
"

  what is the oxygen os is like most beautifful os in android, and camera is awesome...

"
"

  Finger print reader is best battery life charging fast camera quality is super I LOVE THIS PHONE in lower price üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è and good daily delivery packaging giving 5 stars

"
"

  processor was ok but GPU was not really good not support the high quality games but phone is worth the price

"
"

  SUPER FAST CHARGEPERFORMANCE SMOOTH FASTCAMARA IMPROVEDBATTERY 7 HOURS WITH 90 HZ DISPLAY

"
"

  Nice. Good features.

"
"

  I am  faceing network problem in my OnePlus nord. And company is not takeing any action. What should we doSo please OnePlus team take action and solved our problem üôèüôèüôè

"
"

  This phone has beautiful shape and also it looks very standard, coming to the performance, it is well and good, for the people who want buy a phone below 30k just go for this ""NORD"".

"
"

  This phone is having bluetooth issue it cannot connect to my newly purchased boat rockerz 255pro and not having headphone jack other people on oneplus forum are facing the same issue

"
"

  If you were using a phone around 10k and now you want to upgrade inbetween 20k-30k thenThis phone is the bestI really loved itLike no complaints.

"
"

  Battery Life Is Poor Battery getting Fastly Drained When sleeping Mode

"
"

  Wrost thing I received this mobile on 17 aug frome starting to till this mobile phone too much heating problem. You don't calling on earpiece ear heat up Very very disappointed

"
"

  This is the best phone for this price range...believe me its camera is not that bad as they say in the reviews...oxygen os is spot on...its a value for money go...go for ut

"
"

  Very bad battery life. Wont be suitable for long drives and long journeys. Need a powerbank/backup for this type of needs. Wrap charge is fast. All other features are good.

"
"

  After OnePlus 6 this is my 2nd phone, amazing performance for daily use. Value for money

"
"

  Phone is getting heated at the time of using.

"
"

  Great amZing phone

"
"

  Liked so much

"
"

  Bluetooth keeps getting disconnected again and again.Not happy with customer care servicesNot ready for replacement.

"
"

  If you get a phone with no tint issues, then it is a bliss. I won't suggest this for graphic intense games though. Other than that this is a cool phone.

"
"

  In my fone mic is not work what can i do for mic when i am calling to someone from my fone my voice is not hear to those persone whod i calling please tell me what can i do for that

"
"

  the phone had proximity sensor problem and the date given in invoice bill was 28th august but the phone arrived on 4th september and now i cant replace the item neither to one plus.

"
"

  Camera is excellent. Battery backup is good.Screen is much smooth. Altert slider will impress if you haven't use OnePlus smartphone before.Nice Design and build quality.

"
"

  Smooth experience,fast, camera osm ,

"
"

  Though it is 12 MB RAM 256 GB STORAGE phone is slow. Loses tower abruptly.loses data connection abruptly. Slow loading of data even though showing full connection

"
"

  Everything is good but only Google apps in this one plus is very bad decession by one plus team phone app ,bluetooth connectivity is not at all good very pathetic servcie by amozone

"
"

  Camera quality is slightly poor, compared to same cost other devices.

"
"

  Good at it's price point

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is good camera qualify is desent ,battery life is also ok -ok 30w charging

"
"

  I am facing in this mobile of hanging problem form first day of purchasing not a good smart phone in this price.I am not satisfied after purchasing with oneplus nord

"
"

  Nord provides you better value for money as compared to other brands in this range.

"
"

  Its my first oneplus mobile. Very good experience with it. But camera not too good.

"
"

  This is what I exactly needed. All in one phone. Good user experience. It's an all rounder.

"
"

  Packing was nice... don't expect too much about camera... overall performance is good...no audio jack is provided with the phone and original audio jack isn't available in onlineüòí

"
"

  Camera must be improved in software update. Battery backup is decent. Apart from this, brilliant phone. Software + display gives totally premium & smooth experience. Look is great.

"
"

  Wonderful phone.Pure Android resemblance.Light and  easy to hold.One hand operable.Good battery backup.Nice camera.Dont believe in negative reviews.Allrounder power pack.Go for it.

"
"

  OverhypedRedmi note 8 pro is better then thisStudy before buying

"
"

  Battery life was impressive at 90hz. Rear camera is okay. Selfie is bad at this price point.  Had no issues with gaming.  Had screen tint issues and so returned.

"
"

  Descent phone for the price

"
"

  It's not up to the markCamera qualityIs below the  level of 1 + familyIt is nowhere in the reach of 1 plusBetter buy 1 + other phonesNot nord

"
"

  Average phone with overpriced price tag... Average battery, Average camera, nothing in front of Realme X2 pro... If you haven't purchased it yet, go with X2 pro, it works like charm

"
"

  Fingerprint is to much good, Aliso Camera & Battery life hood.

"
"

  battery is not long lasting otherwise everything is great.

"
"

  Calculator is pathetic.....you have to press multiple times to get the right number typed...some times even the after pressing the key the number does not appear on the screen....

"
"

  CONS. Sound quality without headphone is poor.PROS. Rest of the things makes it MASTER PEACE. Best in price to performance ratio as compare to its rivals.

"
"

  Good mobile for reasonable price .You can try the Nord...Battery is super , display is excellent and phone is less wait and easy to handle and carry

"
"

  It was told to us, for pre-booking we would get 6000 voucher from Jio digital. Were is it?

"
"

  Awesome product everything is fine.Nice packaging and 100 percent authentic product.

"
"

  Battery is heating not inserted sim card and camera quality is bad not worth for money and software is normally

"
"

  Descent sound quality , display quality is absolutely great , camera is also descent , good battery life

"
"

  Gud one but camera need to improve

"
"

  Everything works superbly , camera is fixed after update , I am very happy that one plus is fixing the bugs very instantly by providing updates.No issues till date

"
"

  Overall performance is great. Nice build quality and finish. Awesome display quality. Camera quality is also good. Battery backup is disappointing it's draining quickly.

"
"

  A great product. Proud to be a member of one plus team

"
"

  One VERY IRRITATING problem: It makes a sharp beep sound continuously until restarted. Remains okay for sometime or somedays then start again.

"
"

  Everything is good except headphone Jack.Headphone Jack is missing.

"
"

  Battery capacity good,phone weight looks heavy,looks premium,over all am satisfied previously am iphone 7 user,switched to nord for battery and speed!!

"
"

  Processing good .all good .I want battery little moreAprox 5000mah.üòÖü§©

"
"

  I'm like this product

"
"

  Ones you Full charged for a day good enough,which I received one some options are not working and camera wasn't good ( Colours are not displayed in screen exactly what they are )

"
"

  Another successful phone from one plus no words needed to explain

"
"

  Don't go behind of that if you are concerned about battery because its just last in a day with normal usage apart from that it's ok especially display quality. Camera is nice....

"
"

  Go for it...used for 15 day ... amazing experience. Let's see the after service of OnePlus.

"
"

  Right side of the wide camera is blury.. Other than that great but it's a fresh product and it's not supposed to have any issue.. It was disappointing

"
"

  Camera is seriously very bad.....after recording the vedio when play the vedio then moving pixels easily can see.camera is very bad..

"
"

  Nice phone

"
"

  Everything

"
"

  Earphone is not included with box and 3.5mm jack is not available also it is slow in browsing

"
"

  i really like oneplus series mobile. noard is overall good but camera quality is not up to the mark as compare oneplus 6t camera is bestrest overall good (5 star)

"
"

  The selfie quality earlier was not that good but with the updates later its been rectified , battery life is satisfactory, overall is a good phone in this price range .

"
"

  Not that much good I noticed even after taking 12 GB ram ,I see some hanging issue and wallpaper going default image how many times I changed

"
"

  Rear camera good front camera ok baattery life is not good you charge it's  2 times a day

"
"

  One off the budget premium phone ..camera and battery are really amazing

"
"

  Good phone, but expensive for the quality, you can get similar performing phones at 20-22k

"
"

  Not so better but atleast good In this price...

"
"

  Very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very gd

"
"

  Good to use, light weight , performance is awsm battery is quite good but charging is too fast and overall this mobile of this range is awsm, I bought 12GB ram and this was awsm

"
"

  I have taken oneplus nordphone in this device after using half an hour the phone is getting heated after using the YouTube and videos so I want to replace this phone

"
"

  Did not enjoy that thought was too expensive according to the price. Utter nonsense.

"
"

  This is the best smartphone in this range

"
"

  Overall A good User  Experience , Decent Quality .OS is the best clean UI .Camera could have been better . Not the best 7/10Overall 8.3/10 .

"
"

  Camera quality is average and battery is ok but not that great overall its average mobile not up to that hype it created i think soo

"
"

  Every was good camera quality,battery,ram management but there are some bugs like cloud service i want one plus team ro work on them

"
"

  Only display is good, Camera is very bad with over exposure, Sound quality is below average, Battery backup is hardly 6 hours while using. Not value for money

"
"

  The best so far !You can feel the premiumness of the oneplus in much lesser cost !Best in everything !Macro lense can disappoint you but never mind !

"
"

  The display has poor quality polariser, plagued with tint issues and has an SoC with 3 year old GPU not capable of running all apps at 90Hz. A good buy only below 25k.

"
"

  Best phone u must buy this, fingerprint scanner and face detector is very good.camera quality is excellent.batery stands for 1to2days,batery full charged within 1hour.

"
"

  Very good

"
"

  Awesome deviceUsing from past 1 month no issue yet.Only design would be better

"
"

  Superb touch,Camera quality good,Sound very nice,Fingerprint reader also superb,Battery also nice in OnePlus phones.

"
"

  Beyond expectations,really greatThe""super macro mode""was not so goodBut shooting macro using the main sensor is pretty great

"
"

  Best Mobile.,. battery life is very Good.Charge is also very Fast.But camera is small not good.Performance is best.Mobile speed in Gameing is Top level.

"
"

  Really a nice product and I don't have any issues in display. But the battery will drain quickly and not in the good. Otherwise, specs and all good and oxygen os..thumbs up ...

"
"

  It's heating up literally without doing anything .I have not played any games yet still it's at 40 degree celcius.It feels warm .This should not happen.Please fix this problem.

"
"

  Very Premium OnePlus smartphoneI like it  by design and speed and camera and battery charging and all of itAnd I am waiting 5G network to launch in india to test it

"
"

  Awesome phone.''battery life'' pathetic.. Camera quality is awesome.. first few days charged so fast..but now phone take too much time to be charged.. Display is super üëç

"
"

  Fingerprint reader and camera quality is good but battery parformance is not good

"
"

  Nice phone to buy for sure . But you have to handle with care not as rough as other OnePlus devices. Otherwise with 90hz refresh rate smooth working.

"
"

  Battery life is very poor .it's drastically discharged even in stand by mode .It does not have more than 6 hr backup even in very limited use.

"
"

  The most hyped phone for a reason. Its a beast in every category. Loved the cameras. 90hz display is mind blowing. The look of the phone is premium.

"
"

  Gud phone.. but camera is not good as much i expected..

"
"

  It's a wonderful phone in the budget seent the only drawback is it gets heated sometime

"
"

  Camera quality is very bad . Never expect is from one plus...üòå

"
"

  Battery life is not good 100% charging getting only 8 hours and suddenly getting getting hang while using ,and Google assistant is not working and really disappointed

"
"

  Looks Premium and Handy and those who New for OnePlus Family they Will enojy this Beast and Camera and low brightness Issues comes under Cons..üòä overall Good product

"
"

  Do not buy this phone.Bluetooth is not working correctly.Audio clarity is not good in calls.Camera quality very bad.Very bad quality software.

"
"

  Please don't buy nord its not worth the money you pay, camera and battery doesn't meets the expectations at this price range.One plus service is pathetic.

"
"

  Camera is awesome üëåOver all great product.

"
"

  Been using for over a week now and has performed well on all important parameters.  Overall a good purchase!

"
"

  It's very nice mobile, Awesome looking ,very stylish and processor is very nice,Another good product from one plus,And plzz use oneplus buds for excellent performance.

"
"

  Battery life poor ‚òπÔ∏è, but overall mobile good

"
"

  This is super budget range phone from one plusI love it this is a next gen phone guys don't hesitate to buy this it's a must buy.üëçüëç

"
"

  Verry good product

"
"

  Great performance battery backup bis good.

"
"

  Everything is good except a headphone jack and a metal frame. Gonna miss it but still this is due to 5g chip and the cost cutting has to be made somewhere.So,fine‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫

"
"

  I like thiss mobile it was sooo sooo amazinggg everythinggg i love itt ,the battery is wondeefull i didn't feel it 4115 mah its works like 5k mah ,the warp charging is awesome

"
"

  This is the best phone I have got ...best camera ,best battery life of 2days , display is assome,  over all it's 100/100  and Soo much new features available . Tq u one plus .

"
"

  Macro camera and depth sensor are unnecessarily added but the other two camera does a pretty good job.batteryvlife is owesome nd fingerprint reader is quite fast and accurate.

"
"

  The phone is extremely smooth, rarely lags, charges completely within 45 minutes and the camera is great. The only drawback is the battery, it's draining way too fast for 4110

"
"

  Don't purchase this product because this item has a super heating issue and the front camera has image stretching issues. Also, Amazon service not providing a return facility.

"
"

  Superb Mobile Liked it..I liked this mobile too much as compared to other mobiles.Everything in this mobile I liked too much.You can buy this mobile as my opinion.

"
"

  touch very smooth and device performance marvels super and camera quality and battery quality very good ****Charging super ******45 minutes full charging its wonderful awesome

  Don't buy this mobile very very very poor camera quality front and rear battery very bad quality ,fast discharge not, charged within 30 minutes Wi-Fi connectivity more problem,

"
"

  The phone is great in all aspects except the camera. I'm not satisfied with the camera

"
"

  Battery doesn't last long. After full charge it stays for maximum 5 hours. I didn't play any heavy game . Just YouTube and Netflix. Also my selfie camera quality is very bad.

"
"

  This phone is third class don't buy this phone it's not working camera is bad battery very poor quality and display quality is bad video is blur not hd This phone is very bad

"
"

  Phone is average and camera isn't that great in night it is below average battery is ok

"
"

  All of features is best camera prosser touch  and build quality

"
"

  Fingerprint reader, battery life and camera quality good.

"
"

  Amazing phone with a butter smooth functionality and a great UI. the absence of a headphone jack is bit of a bummer. Also great service by amazon. Good job

"
"

  I have used OnePlus 5 before this and it has better camera quality and battery life than this

"
"

  Fluid experience as every other oneplus phone, drawbacks felt was poor audio quality of speakers(missing the stero speaker feature in oneplus 7T).

"
"

  I'm normally social user spend lots of time on social media apps. This phone provide great battery backup (full day) with fast charging, fluent experience of usage.

"
"

  Multiple issues with the phone:Frequest bluetooth disconnectionWifi issuesApps does not work in full screenNo support from OnePlusEtc.

"
"

  Amazing,Smooth, Fast, Quiet long battery, Satisfied with the purchase, Most important is the price for such a good configuration.

"
"

  It is giving very good overall performance. However durability and reliability can be verified after at least 6 months usage only

"
"

  There is a big problem in one plus nord when you pick call and start call recording the caller gets voice that your call has been recorded

"
"

  Camera and it's image quality are disappointing. Screen size feel very small.

"
"

  I am very Happy to buy this OnePlus Nord. Long time wait for Nord.I received OnePlus Nord PreOrder Free Gift Box Of OnePlus Bullet Wireless & Blue Case...ü•≥ü•≥

"
"

  I got my nord today. I notice that in dark mode pink tint in low brightness. I think one plus not taking it seriously. Nd I think I return it after some other test.

"
"

  Mobile came with screen scratches  and over heating  and battery  draining  immediately

"
"

  *Battery life is not up to that mark 4/5*Display and performance is 5/5*camera 4/5* Delivery 5/5*Recommended to purchase if u r not a hardcore gamer.

"
"

  Everything is good for me, really nice but I think bettery is not good, it draining fast charging is there but battery not ok for me  in the day I am charging two times üòüüòê

"
"

  Overall the performance packed in Nord is good, although it is a little on the heavy side. Smooth display refresh rate and camera seems to be working good at night time too.

"
"

  Recording feature is not upto the mark It doe not work without speaker on. SO need to use third party APP.For a flagship such minor features can not be ommitted.

"
"

  Phone is quite fine but battery backup is less

"
"

  Nice handset and thanks to Elec2care for provided discount Awesome service.

"
"

  It's really amazing mobile for this price, camera quality semma, night scapes it's too good,I got this mobile on 4th Aug.  go for it, stunning performance

"
"

  Battery life is worst because of a recent update they can change this problem in the next update but I don't know when they will update please update ASAP

"
"

  ¬†Fingerprint works smoothly. Camera is too good.Super slow motion is best in camera.Battery is ok.

"
"

  Money's worth

"
"

  Excellent performance and Build Quality Nice product and Oxygen OS and Android version

"
"

  I have some issue about video playing it automatically stops for little bit of second

"
"

  Great product. good price range. good camera quality but not up to the mark. It's 5G ready phone but we can't check until 5G network available!!!

"
"

  Very good battery life.Good Camera. Especially Landscape mode.Smooth oxygen Os.Looks cool in blue marbel.Cons:Poor macro camera

"
"

  Mobile was osm...But in that camera side iwas really disappointed with slow motion vedio case because while slow motion vedio taking time screen will flickering...

"
"

  Worth for 30,000 very quick fingerprint reader camera is outstanding

"
"

  Camera quality is awesome.  Super smooth and sensitive. Light weight

"
"

  Hanging problem and bettery life poor

"
"

  Nice mobile good camera clearity

"
"

  I don't believe nord is not proper working. phone is so much lagging and all apps also

"
"

  Phone is good but battery backup is too much low. And there is some heating issue too.

"
"

  I have a very bad issue battery drain nd within 6 days it's by itself reset factory settings by which I lost all my data again which I didn't backup.nd I return the product

"
"

  Awesome product with good hand-in feel with fast fingerprint with effects and camera has some features but they are fantastic all about it is good on that range of one plus

"
"

  Worst mobile . bluetooth is not working it disconnecting again and again.poor customer care services.no reply after staying on line for more then 20 min. Don't go for this.

"
"

  Exciting about my first Oneplus MobileSmooth performanceAwesome cameraSound quality little bit lowerVery sleek designBest Mobile in this price

"
"

  i used the phone overall performance good but have to compromise with camera quality of one plus brand which is looking like real me or redmi,vivo, opo etc

"
"

  Almost everything is on this phone . I'm really loving this device . It's amazing ü§©

"
"

  main problem is fluctuating screen after opening the mobile, overall product is good

"
"

  Highly disappointed with camera quality... one of the worst camera of OnePlus series

"
"

  Display quality,Camera, Phonecolour is good, value for money üëçOverall Classic

"
"

  It's good

"
"

  The display went green and then black within 2-3 hours of usage.

"
"

  Looks Cool... Eager to Using and Review will be posted after the using of this ""Nord""

"
"

  Front Camera working properlly as compare to Main Camera of 48 mega pixel .It's gameing phone ever .Pubg bilkul mkhhan chlta hü§óü§óü§ó

"
"

  This is my first oneplus phone really disappointed with oneplus, ph was really good but with the display issues I have returned the ph 2nd time.

"
"

  Totally unhappy with the phone .battery is very poor .unable to connect Bluetooth to my car .dual sim issue .pls ask someone to call .planning to return the phone

"
"

  Warp charging is not working. It's taking more than an hour for getting fully charged. Switched from apple, not much satisfied.

"
"

  It is good. But it heats up for heavy use. It's not that great as it advertise.

"
"

  overall looking good, camera quality ok ok type, video quality is not good, battery life is ok and processor is superb!

"
"

  Great device

"
"

  ¬†I want to refund it because there is a problem on it's software .I have showed this in the one plus store several times.

"
"

  The worst purchase ever made. If you are looking for a camera phone. Please don‚Äôt ever think of buying this phone. It‚Äôs a loss of money big time.I regret buying this phone

"
"

  When charging/using some features, Mobile warming .other things ok, camera quality super,touch screen smooth like butter,is anyMemory card inserted for data storage.

"
"

  I am using nord since more than 1 monthIt's really awesome displayGood buildGood cameraBattery is average

"
"

  Found camera quality okayish not at par with OP 8/8Pro or 7T even. Rest is fine and can be a go-to if usage is not heavy. Indeed the color is best I have ever came across.

"
"

  Very amazing phone no problem found I am using from 5 days it's better choise to have this phone thank u

"
"

  Awesome camera, quick finger print reader

"
"

  As compare to other oneplus mob.  The camera gives white effect on pic....  Gaming exp.. is great

"
"

  Go for it

"
"

  Its a good allrounder device a well finished product.  Usually i upgraded from a low end device so my first experience is very good ,A premium Midranger

"
"

  OnePlus nord doesn't have automatic call recording option., For business people call recording option is important.This made me soo disappointing.

"
"

  good battery life, snappy interface, good pixel density for reading text.

"
"

  This is the best phone in this segment by huge margin, the bright and smooth experience. Camera is expected to be great in some updates. Looks good and feels good in hand.

"
"

  Camera quality is awesome...but fingerprint reader & battery life are above average.....build quality is poor...always take care this device with its case cover.

"
"

  A small issue seeing nowhere "" Reboots automatically when phone inside pocket"" expect this everything good performance

"
"

  Overall phone is good. Cameras are okDisplay is good, but there is a green tint issue ( it is not major issue)Fingerprint and face unlock are pretty good too.

"
"

  The bestest phone ever.Quality of this product is very very good.At lowest Price this phone has power pack performance.Camera quality is truly fabulous.

"
"

  Phone  is good but it will get switched off by itself. While talking and using it will get switched off itself. I am frustrated now.why is this happening it's new phone .

"
"

  Using it from almost 2 months. Battery life is decent. Gaming performance is great. Camera is ok. Charges very fast 100% in 60mins.Overall performance is very good.

"
"

  Excellent phone with very high end capabilities.I hvae OnePlus: 2, 5, 6 and now OnePlus Nord.Thank you Oneplus

"
"

  01.09.20 i got my oneplus nord , guys don't think just go ahead, its  good and luxury looksü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç, very smooth phone

"
"

  Camera is average. iPhone cam is far better than nord.

"
"

  It is good product. Battery is draining little early. The camera quality is also good.The apps functions very smoothly. NO DAMAGE TO THE PRODUCT.

"
"

  The OnePlus Nord is value for money. It's not the flagship phone , but still a best buy in the price segment . All the features of the phone work well.

"
"

  Finger print reader is excellent,battery life is somewhat bad,but camera quality is too good.Thus it's a best quality mobile at this price.......

"
"

  Amazing phone with super camera and great value for money,I am buying one plus phones for first time but it is really far better than any other brands.

"
"

  Pics got blur both front and rear..after concerned with technical support....it still not resolved..Want to return and refund..but they cut the every time

"
"

  Camera is so nice with every details crystal Sharp especially 48 pixels. Finger print read  er responds with lightening speed.  Battery also performs very well.

"
"

  Front camera is suck it doesn't have a match of my phn vivo v7 and tint issue is there not satisfiedüò≠

"
"

  Phone looks stunning and all the features are Awesome and its speed is good üëç and camera is also good but need improvements ,it can be better

"
"

  Very nice... Value for money, good battery life, super fast fingerprint reader, smooth performance. Love it a lot. Close your eyes and buy it.

"
"

  Too good

"
"

  Very Quick reading but display have to turn on to unlock phone & battery life super

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is super fast and  I am not satisfied with the camera quantity .

"
"

  Calling from same network on different phone oneplus nord camera stop working on video call. Ph have hanging problem even in 8gb ram. And battery life is 12hr in working

"
"

  Awsome mobile not any problems about product and shipping aslo ‚ô•Ô∏è outstanding battery backup camara quality is also excellent not any problem to purchase this product üòç

"
"

  Phone is really above average in almost everything be it camera, battery life or processor. Also the OxygenOS experience speaks for itself. I would definitely recommend.

"
"

  battery health is very low of this phone and Amazon  not listen my view of point about replacement. Amazon customer service have no information about replacement policy.

"
"

  Nord has awesome built quality and hand feel is awesome plus Oxygen OS is iceing on the cake. Low light selfies could have been better, hope OP will fix it with updates.

"
"

  good....

"
"

  best budget phoneand the cover inisde the box is amazingfully satisfied

"
"

  This fone looks good and premium feeling when I saw the fone 1st time....

"
"

  Worst not expected such low camera qualityI purchased this phone just because of camera and this is what one plus is giving us?Front camera is all rubbish grany type

"
"

  Battery is good.. display.. in hand feel. Charging.. OS.All are best.. but Cameraa is not up to the mark

"
"

  Everything was fine....The screen resolution might have been better ...Just 1080x2400 pixels doesnt satisfy this phones stamina..might have gone for a 1440*2560 at least

"
"

  Battery life should have been better

"
"

  Battery life is too good and and phone is charge from 10 to 100% in just around 50 minutes.depth camera result is not good but overall camera is good.

"
"

  Speaker is not working in 10 days after purchase even though I set the right volume. Restarted mobile two times, still not working. Pls help me with this issue

"
"

  2 main problems...1. not performing like 8 GB processor2. every day display close time reset.overall not a very Good phone ,price is too high

"
"

  Phone heats too much . Battery doesn't last long. I was very excited as i am a one plus customer from past 3 years. Never expected such kind if disappointment.

"
"

  It's my first experience in oxygen OS and really it gives you completely nice behavioural experience.After using few days I can recommend this to anyone.

"
"

  Phone is good for daily use.Battery and camera quality can be improved.Software needs to be ironed out, there are couple of bugs.

"
"

  One plus nord like this phone battery camera so better look this device

"
"

  Camera üì∏ is average battery life is good fingerprint scanner good .very handy phone easy to use very less weight.overall good package in 30k

"
"

  Camera quality is pretty bad, there is no call recording feature which many other manufacturers are supporting in India now.

"
"

  One of the best in the Market...couldn‚Äôt have ask for more!!!

"
"

  the handset does not support a head phone.  Phone has a type C socket but it does not support a head phone with type C socket.  Blue tooth head phones can only be used.

"
"

  The product which i got is defective... And battery drained very fastly.waited almost 1month and got this defective product.Amazon thinks that their customers are fool.

"
"

  Insprit of nord there is many phone are available in market on this price segment I choose only nord because of one plus branding and his smoothness thank you to amazon

"
"

  Back camera is not working properly and customer care committed for return on 8/July but yet phone not taken back by Amazon and now customer care not connecting my call

"
"

  Worst of a kind of thing neplus standard

"
"

  Excellent phone in lower range of one plus...

"
"

  Clean and Smooth OSI found it best in class.Average speaker, can be made better.Otherwise Excellent phone.

"
"

  The phone is super awesome...Thanks to amazon n seller for the fast n safe delivery of product before its saleüòú..super excited üëçüèª

"
"

  This phone is geting heated up in no time & battery backup is not that great too

"
"

  Cons:Battery is patheticCamera is below avgSpeaker is avgPros:Screen is very goodFeels like a premium phone

"
"

  The best 2020 mobile as of till date. The camera Quality is superb & very smooth & fast touch.New implementation and specifications are good.Loved it

"
"

  Build quality is awesome, faster nd smooth performance..Very disappointed with the battery life.. charges very fast.. and discharges very fast as well..

"
"

  camera quality k ph inter face gud bt battery life worst

"
"

  Not the best for gaming , not the best for camera , if you need a slight upgrade from very old phones and one plus branding then go for it .

"
"

  Really awesome phone must buyFeel like feather is in handPrimium phoneLook is awesome30 w fast charger helps a lot

"
"

  Awesome feel, really good

"
"

  Awesome mobile.....but back camera is not upto other one plus models...front camera is superb....battery life is just amazing...good mobile in this budget..go for it..

"
"

  Product is fine but there is no way to download an invoice or link it to oneplus appPlease let us know from where to get the bill invoice for this purchase

"
"

  It has several issues , less battery life and you'll even face other hardware and software issues with the device as well. Better to go with other variants of oneplud.

"
"

  i bought 12gb 256gb nord, Superb, stylish n sleek. It's very easy to handle really a flagship in less price into the market

"
"

  Hi, I started using the phone today everything else is good but the battery is draining faster and I'm facing the heating issues.Hope someone from one plus help me out

"
"

  Quality phone. Camera and fingerprint and battery life so amazing

"
"

  Except camera remaining things work perfect,camera performance needs to fix with the software updates, Iam satisfied with the Nord.

"
"

  Pro camera is not as much sharp as i can imagine.Too much weight.

"
"

  It's super nice product.

"
"

  I got bad experience from the OnePlus nord beacuse its automatically master reset every 4 days... Battery drain very fastly.. even normal useage....

"
"

  Good mobile in this price range which supports 5G

"
"

  Camera Quality is Very Low ..In Other Words It Is Non Sense Camera both Front and Back...It acts like a VGA Camera in Low light and Selfies Are Just Waste...

"
"

  Amazing phone sound quality in speaker very good.cameras superb faster performance High grade mid range price mobile after iphone I suggest for all this nord

"
"

  The best camera with amazing sony lense make it alive. Overall 10/10 for the every feature included. Battery life and charging speed is miraculous. Hats off!

"
"

  Something is better than nothing

"
"

  Pathetic camera please do not buy this product sincere request to all my brother's n sister'sInvest on OnePlus 7 or 8 not Nord please

"
"

  One of the best smartphone as like apple is brand.full paisa casual mobile phone in indian market.power full battery and luxury smart camra

"
"

  Battery capacity is very bad

"
"

  One of the best in 2020. everything is perfect.

"
"

  Nord os is looking  like Motorola  os and after long term use touch is becoming  slow and normal with mobile data pubg and free fire is not able to  play check it out

"
"

  ¬†Slow motion issues and cannot shoot 4K 60 FPS in front camera I hope OnePlus team will fix this soon via Software update.

"
"

  Performance is good! Camera quality is not good as expected! Fingerprint sensor should be improved! There is no charging light indicator or missed call/message alert!

"
"

  This device is simply awesome, display is quite good, nice battery backup, decent camera, performance aslo good, it's a very handy device....overall device is awesome

"
"

  Battery is discharging within 7-8 hours

"
"

  Awesome

"
"

  ¬†So far so good

"
"

  Fastest fingerprint reader ever seen..Night mode is super boom..Battery performance needs little more improvement to avoid draining..

"
"

  Mobile is fast and snappy, good displayBut I facing some heating issues (nothing serious). Camera performance not up to mark

"
"

  You can't compare it with the Flag ship Phones.......Light weight so handle with care.

"
"

  Nice product with perfect delivery time

"
"

  The mobile is awesome.. but the battery life is not so good even in 60Hz

"
"

  Not worth, Google dialer ruined the phone, lacks basic features.

"
"

  Phone is excellent for 26k. Front cam got little whitening issue (not saying it's bad) which can be fixed with gcam/new update. Overall very good!.

"
"

  Very good phone if the battery life was more then it would have been an excellent one. Battery consumption is very quick but charging also is quick

"
"

  Overall I loved the phone. Camera quality inside is not that good. Battery exhausts fast . Else I haven't figured out anything bad about the phone.

"
"

  I had a display issue like green and pink tint effect and I'm not satisfied this mobile.There no replacement option also so pls think it and buy this mobile

"
"

  If you are looking for a phone with Awesome performance, awesome OS, Awesome Screen, Awesome Camera & Awesome Everything....This is the phone for you!

"
"

  Awesome phone.. but battery drains fast.. otherwise gud phone..with great os and is support...also it's speaker is not great if u are regular speaker user..

"
"

  No tint problem i my device. Upto 6 to 7 hours of screen on time so good battery life.Charging is very fast and i am satisfied with this oneplus nord.

"
"

  Perfect phone for that person who working and not interested game and all ...That phone is fix in there price with our comfortable 5G future !!

"
"

  Fingerprint is fast and battery life is as good as for usage of one day. Camera quality is like thik thik.

"
"

  One of the best quality of Display and best Phone under 30k premium segment.For first time One Plus user definitely try Nord..

"
"

  Just for the brand name,It's a affordable and economical phone.Camera quality is not that good.Good phone at this price.

"
"

  Camera needs to be optimized. Charging is very fast because of Warp charge.. but the most important feature 3.5mm jack space is not there.

"
"

  PREMIUM SMARTPHONEOVERALL CAMERA QUALITY GOOD BOTH SIDEPREMIUM FEEL1+ BEST BUDGET 5G PHONEBATTERY PERFORMANCE GOOD

"
"

  Wrist in casting and unable to play videos in casting...

"
"

  Everything is ok...But if you are a gamer..Don't buy this ..PUBG not runs smoothly in it..The game restarts everytime. Moreover freefire does not run in this device.

"
"

  I have already OnePlus Nord this phone is very interesting many others new features and most valuable camra in this fin and warp charging is also like a magic üëçüëçü§©

"
"

  Delivered on 2nd October. But recently occurred the problem of automatic factory reset. This is pathetic...may be the issue with new OS update but still its horrible

"
"

  One of the best budget phone under 30k.I have seen lots of review on YouTube that don't buy this phone, but after using it you will find those reviews useless.

"
"

  Battery performance is not good either, it requires another round of charging by 8 PM, and heating issues also there, if anyone buying one Nord one again be careful.

"
"

  Camera quality is not awesome,but good.Very smooth experience.

"
"

  Super I like this mobile

"
"

  Nord is one of the best choice for experiencing  oxigen OS under 30K

"
"

  Another Android phone with good camera..  price is very high. Not able to connect auto Android properly. Not felt special

"
"

  I buyed 12/256 GB,must tell u good phone at this price range,if u are looking for a budget phone then u must go for it...

"
"

  The product is not value for money, It is just Oneplus brand so you need to pay extra 4-5k for the features it gives you.

"
"

  Awesome üëå finish üëè  good work

"
"

  good

"
"

  Good

"
"

  This is an overall phone under 30k , easily to recommend ,and also use gcam for camera it just boost the quality.

"
"

  Finger print reader is fast. Battery back up is great. Good phone for normal usage. Its my 4th day and loving it.

"
"

  phone is okay no issues as such and screen is responsive also battery is very good . but a below average camera !

"
"

  Nice smart phone with all the updated features but don‚Äôt expect camera as a pro. Other than that everything good.

"
"

  Awesome

"
"

  Camera quality and Battery life need to improve. Disappointing in Battery life.I hope future updates will resolve these things from OnePlus.

"
"

  It's really a phone worth spending money. üòçüòçüòçHAPPY TO BE A ONLEPLUS NORD OWNER. üòç#NEVERSETTLE. Battery life could have been better but still it's fine.

"
"

  Front camera is not at all good need a update for this and there is sometimes there's is heat issue also, remaining everything is fine and fast charging is good.

"
"

  Camera quality is terrible. Low and cheap quality. Didn't expect this from One Plus. Don't ruin the brand name.Except camera, phone performance is average.

"
"

  Battery life is too short, please improve it and optimise it n provide us through software updates,and also provide pubg 60fps smooth extreme by default.

"
"

  This is a perfect One plus phone at this range. Smooth and Buttery Experience ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Battery life is pretty good at 60hz and camera quality is good after the update

"
"

  I have no words about this item. I love you amazon. It is just owesome. Everything great in a great deal.

"
"

  The product is average.Camera - BadBattery- GoodPerformance- ExcellentDisplay- There is tint issueMostly the product is not satisfying

"
"

  The phone is as it is you would expect.The most important thing is that it has not disappointed me.OnePlus has surely did a great thing with this phone!

"
"

  One of the best 5G brand phone under 30k and everything is great other than finger print sensor it's little slow when compared to other phone at this price segment.

"
"

  The Finger Print Scanner is having issues it need atleast 3 times to read a print. Other that that the Overall performance of the Phone is more than the expectation

"
"

  Been using for almost 1 and half month. Loving the 90hz amoled screen. Battery performance good after updates. There is no better OS than Oxygen. Best budget phone.

"
"

  Heating issue on video call and also camera does not  open sometime and power button issue 4ya 5 time press then work. Very bad experience for me with one plus Nord

  When I put my mobile in charging.. Than mobile give a hit... And I have to switch off my mobile for 15 minute.. So than it's come in Normal temperature...

"
"

  Exceeded my expectations. The screen is just brilliant. Im not a camera person so this was enough but the best part about this is the oxygen os. Oxygen os for life

"
"

  Battery draining issue. Very high battery consumption using hotspot, video calls.Camera quality is average.Screen quality and performance is very good.

  Battery backup is very poor and photo also come with blur Otherwise phone is ok. I used my phone after Full charge but in 3 hours battery drain remaining only 33%.

"
"

  Not a review, the phone is great. But I was one of the unfortunate ones who received a unit with green tint issue. Would attempt to replace, or return and reorder.

"
"

  If audio jack and SD card slot are there it would be4 star for me. Fingerprint reader is not good.

"
"

  Worst camera quality i have ever seenVery disappointed with the camera quality ,this wasn't expected from oneplus

"
"

  Purchased this phone for my son and received after 3 days packing was good and works really well overall great purchase

"
"

  Almost great in every aspect. The only issue is battery drains rapidly as it charged in a similar manner. Overall good product.

"
"

  Camera quality is best

"
"

  Nice Mobile, good looking, performance, speed.. overall amazing, better price also.

"
"

  Battery Life is good. Camera not the best but the new update improves the calibration and quality. Fingerprint Reader is a bit laghu but not bad

"
"

  Camera is not up to the mark...other then that everything is perfect ‚úåüèª If you are looking for great camera then oneplus nord is not for you...

"
"

  Battery life is little less. Discharges quickly. 3.5mm audio jack missing.its a big miss. A type c to 3.5 audio adapter must have been provided.

"
"

  Camera quality are amazing in day light but in low light conditions it captures low quality pictures .Performance are amazing üòç due to oxygen os .

"
"

  Excellent Phone with high quality.. super day light camera.. awesome selfi camera.. Super processor..All in all performance is great and awesome üëç

"
"

  Premium Experience of screen and is...battery draining fast ...less than 1 day battey run...good product but first look was not much batter than vivo V20

"
"

  Overall very good phone.

"
"

  Worthless pls don't buy this phone battery backup very very very poor

"
"

  Sim Network is there but after every 2-3 hours, call is not going and coming.same is informed OnePlus community and Amazon. But no proper solution has been given.

"
"

  Battery is not good or phone was not good what i expectedWhen you use phone 30 min continues phone was in to much heat and battery backup is also not enough

"
"

  Phone has dent and connectivity issues. Have applied for return. And took inspection services also. Nothing happened. Pls take the phone and return my money back.

"
"

  this phone is amazing and would surely recommend this phone to others. the only con is that the battery life is average, other than that this is an amazing phone.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is so fast, battery life is good and camera quality is awesome in day light condition and nightscape mode is to good

"
"

  Good quality

"
"

  1. Durinng a regular use phone heats a lot.2. Performance is not up to the mark as it lags most of the time, 3. Battery drains quickly so need to charge it more frequently.

"
"

  Features are good performance is also excellent

"
"

  Great mobile for daily usage.Blindly you can buy this product

"
"

  Camera quality not upto mark but rest of the things will certainly satisfy day to day needs. Speed is incredibly fast.

"
"

  Good in performance but battery is not good

"
"

  Not at all happy with the camera and screen, colours are too dull and dead

"
"

  ¬†Best phone at this price range.

"
"

"
"

  Having a excellent experience with 1+ nord.... Good Battery Life, Good camera quality more than I expected....good performance.... all things are good.....

"
"

  The biggest mistake that the kit does not include a headphones conector after buying such flagship phone if company does not provide headphone conector very poor

"
"

  The camera on this phone works to the fullest with GCAM mod. I was surprised while comparing the selfie camera's photos tured with gcam mod and stock camera.  If

"
"

  Call recorder facilities not provided.. battery life not much better then other OnePlus mobiled

  The camera quality is great but battery backup is little disappointing as per the brand.on paper it shows 5-6 hour battery life but in real life its just 4 hours.

"
"

  Fabulous phone.. With latest updated technology.Recommended for use.

"
"

  Finger print scanner not satisfied

"
"

  No display issue very fast no heat atalll

"
"

  My one plus Nord fell down from bed the day after I baught it wid its back cover nd the back panel got damage..does warranty cover for panel damage..?

"
"

  I like to display smoothness, camera,  build quality, charging speed, loud mono speakerI hate to heating, microlens 2MP, plastic frame.

"
"

  The only issue I've faced so far is that the clock sometimes shows the wrong time requiring me to switch off the phone and switch it back on.

"
"

  The battery life is fine as it provides almost 7 hrs of screen on time and the camera quality as u can check I have already posted a photo and it's not editied

"
"

  One Plus nord is great phone it's havin equal quality to one plus 8 pro cameras touch sensors are very smooth it's really awesome to use this kind of processor

"
"

  This product is amazing interms of battery , screen performance but there are some minor fixations required like audio , gaming graphics bluetooth connectivity

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  OnePlus Nord Absolute Fine Extra ordinary Frame Premium Look Battery life also Good and Best Refresh Rate 90HzüíØüíØüíØüíØ

"
"

  You have to hold the phone in a very steady manner else it will give blurred images..except camera rest everything looks promising..

"
"

  ¬†Glitches while you use Google app or WhatsApp. Fingerprint sensor doesn't work always. Issues with the microphone.

"
"

"

  Very Disappointed, I expect something sple, but nothing spl here

"
"

  Finger print goodBattery life not goodCamera quality average

"
"

  Defect products delivered to me and battery , system performance is not upto the mark.

"
"

  Really a good product....satisfied with the camera,battery,and everything.

"
"

  Worth for money and good life excellent but happy it's good nord

"
"

  The phone was good in the beginning, but it not keeping the speed after a month. Well, I feel maybe this phone over priced.

"
"

  Thrilling at the begining. Lots of fatal issues then onwards. Really irritating to see this from 30k OnePlus. Disappointed!

"
"

  Great performance with an absolute beast display. Charging is super fast with a good battery life .Overall worth the money.

"
"

  Screen look classical.but battery drain fast all through good

"
"

  Nice and good  but rarely ot os hanging.....

"
"

  Amazing product ,I will give this 10 out of 10 for each featuresCamera is soo goodBattery life is excellentOne plus is lit ‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Value for money. got it delivered today. Excellent phone. Good performance. Camera is good as well..espcially option of night scape is great

"
"

  Camera quality very bad and blutooth also not working properly deactivate automatically when calls and music better go for another mobile...

"
"

  I'm very Happy üòä as I'm a normal user... I'm not a Gamer .... For my daily usage it is more than enough ü§ó

"
"

  Battery drain quickly from 100 to 60%, then after it ok. Also between 50-100% idle mode battery drainage is high.Hope next update will improve it.

"
"

  Best mobile phone.. Filling Osm with  Oxygen OS. But 1+ Need to increase Battery backup. Camera quality is also best.  Fingerprint scanner is aslo very fast..

"
"

  Today got my Nord first of all thanks to Amazon for very fast delivery and Nord is one of the best phone go for it awesome premium feel as well as performance

"
"

  üëç

"
"

  Gifted my mom and she loves it

"
"

  Camera is not good

"
"

  Don't go for this phone.You are gonna waste your money.It gets hanged sometimes.There was no point of creating a hype like point.

"
"

  Fingerprint is the good workBattery life bestCamera also good

"
"

  Loved one plus Nord. over one plus 8. Special to camera and battery

"
"

  Could have improved the camera quality a bit and the quality of plastic body of the phone was another thing to worry with the price we have paid...!

"
"

  I received a defect product which is not allowing us to use any earbuds...need immediate assistance from Amazon as facing trouble in attending calls

"
"

  Looks good. Good for everyday use. 6 cameras are just a gimmick. Instead of in necessary cameras like macro lens, they could have reduced the price.

"
"

  Everything is just balanced in this phone. A complete package but if you looking something special in this phone that is look and overall experience

"
"

  I am abig fan of one plus, nord is budget phone with all manjor features. Overall Excellent product and packaging was good

"
"

  Useful for normal user but not pro users.

"
"

  I have bought it for my brother..... Battery life is good.... Camera quality is also good... Overall best phone for this range... Go for it

"
"

  Camera quality ossom.fingerprint work well but battery draining was good.

"
"

"
"

  OnePlus Nord Battery Issue will be Sorted if u Disabled there Message App as there is a Bug and Download 3rd Party from PlayStore u will Start Enjoy ur Nord.

"
"

  Good Phone. But I miss my Xiaomi phone.

"
"

  Today, I received my oneplus NordOxygen OS is pretty much awesomeI loved itI will give 4 out 5 overall ratingYou could also try it üòâ

"
"

  Gud phone. But without 5g there is nothing special in it

"
"

  Phone is heating too much cannot able to touch in ear üòû during call don't buy this phone battery life is very poor

"
"

  Battery life is very average.50% battery drained in 6-7 hours even without proper use of phone.(no gaming or binge watching)

"
"

  Camera quality needs improvement

"
"

  It's owesome. After 2 updates camera features is mind blowing.

"
"

  Ultimate cameraI'm really love it..But your delivery is so late*

"
"

  Bad product. Had to place return order on the 26th day, as it stopped working and found to be dead

"
"

  Camera quality is much less than what is expected from oneplus..

"
"

  OnePlus is doing their best, timely they are providing updates to fix the buggy camera performance.However, in 30k no phone can compete Nord.

"
"

  Everything is fine but had green tint issue in low brightness. And colours fade out in OnePlus clock app in dark mode. Overall Performance is good.

"
"

  üòÖ ...Even though it is new to market ,it is Nord. Still fighting to give better experience to user.hope it will give us satisfaction...üòé

"
"

  The processor is good. The camera is Good. WRAP charge is Very good. Battery life is below average. Overall Good product with great looks.

"
"

  Overall phone is good but when we using whatsapp call then wifi signals gets down due to that call gets drop,Very poor experience for whatsapp calling

"
"

  this is very bad phone due to no memory card accept in sim slots, no all copy picked up in clipbord only one latest copy pick, multifunctions not avalilable

"
"

  I have been using this phone for one monthOnePlus nord is very fast, camera is very good, battery life is amazing. everything is perfect for this rate

"
"

  Good product by 1+ and work properly.The camera are very good at outdoor shootThe speed is excellent.This is .......#_@sh.with love üß°üß°üóº

"
"

  Not worth for the moneyVery poor build quality, poor performance by processorI didn't expect this from OnePlusIam very dissatisfied üòîüòîüòî

"
"

  Camera is literally Struggling alot, Better camera of oneplus 7 i feel

"
"

  Under 30000 best in the market...!!!!!.... Excellent..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüòé

"
"

  Nice battery back up, fast charging, value for each Penney.. must buy.

"
"

  Really superb every thing is perfect.Battery performance lil bit drain

"
"

  Can be skipped if you are searching for a premium phone because it does not feel like one.

"
"

  Worth for money product. One plus is just awesome.

"
"

  Awesome product in this price.It's value for moneyGood camera and smooth performance.

"
"

  Perfect in this price,but 5g network is still need to be check.

"
"

  Good phone great performanceFeels lite weightoxygen os üòò

"
"

  Excellent quality... worth it.

"
"

  Full charge battery works only for 6 to 8 hours and it takes more time to charge full battery against company claims of 30 minutes. Average Mobile

"
"

  Never buy any products from Amazon bcz it's customer service very poor.About phone.Camera quality is vry low below then expected

"
"

  Mobile is exordinary  Thank you to OnePlus  Never settle. .

"
"

  It's a very excellent product I am very satisfied with its performance.

"
"

  I bought yesterday i was happy but Bad battery backup, they lied 70% charged in 30 minutes, i there is problems in my mobile plz exchange

"
"

  Good battery life and camera quality but it's processor and other features r not worth of 28k.it is better to buy Samsung or other brands

"
"

  I didn't like that they have not provided and audio jack output. I get this is flagship phone but don't have to make it obvious like this

"
"

  Extraordinary phone with no issues as mentioned in some online videos & photos 100% worth & valuableOnePlus as usual best in market

"
"

  I have bought a worst phone ever.My one plus Nord gets heat during call and battery back up is worst..waste of money on this price range ..Don't go for it.

"
"

  Battery drains so fast but fast charging is awesome as claimed by the company..... And the phn is fully ok üëå@Oneplus plz fix the battery drain issue

"
"

  I dnt recommend because there is no Bluetooth speaker for phone calls facing issue üò† . Invested lot of money but this product is not worth for that price.

"
"

  The Product is very good even though it comes around 30k. The only Disappointing Fact is that, there is no headphone jack:( . I would give it 4.5/5 rating.

"
"

  Good phoneDisplay quality, fingerprint lock,face recognition ,camara are very goodBattery back up is also awesome i got 7 to 8 hrs on a avg use

"
"

  This is awesome creation of one plus.... All features are very good..those who's wants to buy good quality phone within good range should try this phone...

"
"

  battery issueBluetooth issueheat up issueDisplay ok

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  Waste phone... 4 years old phone One plus 5 is better than these useless box.

"
"

  Apart from Camera quality and the plastic frame of the phone, its totally awesome. Living upto one plus standard of performance.

"
"

  Display can be more brighter and sound performance is moderate. Rest is fine

"
"

  Superb phone camera quality is excellentPhone is working very smoothly

"
"

  Oxygen OS, fast charging, good camera, great screen ... Brilliant experience

"
"

  Low light camera quality not soo good

"
"

  Good phone.Can be used for long term .Camera is good.phone is heavyNo gift i received even though Iprebooked the phone.Even no communication received

"
"

  It is not worth its battery does not able stand for one day means 12 hours at least at low usage

"
"

  Overall this is pretty wonderful phone. I have been using feom past one month now and no issues.

"
"

  Good phone. Value for the money. Having features of 70,000 phone

"
"

  Worth for price. Front camera could have been much more better

"
"

  Disappointed from battery performance & Front Camera.while taking selfy it takes 3 to 4 sec time delay.u have to constantly on same position.üòÄüòÄ

"
"

  I used it for one week but I figured something it got stuck. Its charging fast but also battery backup is not so good. All other things are good.

"
"

  After all it is Chinese phone ,some times laging in performance not good compared to samsung galaxy..feeling very bed for going chinise product..

"
"

  Battery life sucks even after installing update.Camera quality not as expected. M31 in the lower end is doing good than this

"
"

  Was good user experience with this device ...But the speaker is avg ..And battery according to 4000mah it's good ...Display is awesome..

"
"

  Worst camera of one plus

"
"

  i was worried when i order the product but im satisfied  with the phone ... no screen issues only thing is battery drain bit fast ...rest i really like it

"
"

  I love my OnePlus Nord.. it's very smooth... fingerprint, battery life ND cemera quality is quite good..but I think cemera quality need some improvement..

"
"

  The fingerprint reader is so fast.Camera is also good.Display is so smoother definitely u vl enjoy it.If  ur tough Gamer don't buy this.

"
"

  Feels premium..processor is better.....display(90hz) is crazy.. charging speed is awesome.....blue color looks sexy....charger is heavy.....overall 4.5/5.

"
"

  Finally got my one plus phone

"
"

  Super phone.must buy this only even if oneplus nord n10 5G is launched as it is having best features and good processor

"
"

  Very much satisfied with the device. There are no cons to speak about on this phone. Worth for Money. Thanks to OnePlus

"
"

  It's really great experience. Made in India assembly.

"
"

  Camera is awesome üëå no compromiseIt's a night shot still looks clear detailedBattery life is good and the oxygen OS is clearly a game changer

"
"

  Overall nice , except camera quality

"
"

  Good Phone to buy, very nice features, superb fast wrap charging need less then hour to refill battery. Overall Good with Newly built Oxygen OS.

"
"

  Good experience when using OnePlus NordScreenguard quality is very poorApart from that best budget phone everThank you OnePlus

"
"

  Mobile working Speed & Battery life is very Good.Sometimes Network speed Reduces to Zero suddenly while browsing. Camera Micro mode quality is very Poor.

"
"

  Phone battery is very good. Stays whole day in one charge. Full charge in 40 mins. Back camera is awesome but front camera doesn‚Äôt meet the expectations.

"
"

  Budget phone...late delivery due to unavailability..Bad battery backup..Good üì∑Fast processor..Awesome product.

"
"

  Didn't even a single lag since the first boot. Would have been given 5 stars if they included stereo speakers and 3.5mm headphone jack.

"
"

  OnePlus nord is best.I have no complaints. The charging speed is so good and everything is superb!

"
"

  Fingureprint reader is good. Bit confused about battery life some times it's better and some totally lost.. no doubt about performance.

"
"

  Really Impressed with One plus Nord.. Simply Superb

"
"

  Perfect perfomance

"
"

  Worth to buy

"
"

  Battery is faster drain.heating issue. sim net is dropping every time

"
"

  Value for money, camera quality is good

"
"

  Do not buy this model, net work issue

"
"

  Nice phone and very fast delivery but some problems with this phone feeling not OnePlus it‚Äôs ordnery tipe price will be 22000 perfect not 29999

"
"

  Battery life can be enhanced,othervise the product is very good. Also this is my first one plus product and I am pretty much impressed with it.

"
"

  Pros: Good display, good battery Life. Fingerprint sensor and display are very goodCons: Moderate Camera quality especially at low lights

"
"

  Camera is not upto mark and Bluetooth connectivity is very bad. During call my ear buds disconnected so many times. This is really a bad thing.

"
"

  I didn't expect a great experience from a mid range processor,but performed well sometimes faster than a flagship processor. display is decent.

"
"

  Very bad experience with battery life, battery drains very fast as compare to Vivo and oppo phones. Need to charge compulsory twice. Please don't buy...

"
"

  Phone is awesome...it's battery backup is also very nice and it gets charged very fast..in 40 mins it is charged 100%...camera quality is also very nice

"
"

  The phone is OK. Its not that special as it was hyped. Just the alert slider and camera makes it somewhat better than other. Processing speed is decent.

"
"

  Defective product. Battery is worst.. draining very very fast.. oly last 3 hrs. Charging speed 23% to 64% it's tooks 1 hrs and 10 mins. Need replacement

"
"

  An amazing phone with well-balanced specs.. good camera, but do need battery optimization for most of the apps.. which may improve with future updates..

"
"

  Fingerprint reader, battery life and camera quality is 2 very best and 2 much but jio sim is not work then mobile data is off, so i give NORD 0 STAR ...

"
"

  Display is good. Camera is okay. Bluetooth has inconveniences with JBL 45BT headphones. While playing Prime video bT is disconnecting.

"
"

  A great peace of mind and wonderful function from OnePlus Nord.. excellent design, performance and quality...

"
"

  Phone is pretty good, and value for money...in my opinion.

"
"

  Product very nic. But not useful for those who use wired ear phones for long tele conference, since there was no slot

"
"

  Phone display great and camera just average and speaker sound average overall good phone but camera need much improve

"
"

  Performance is goodBack camera is awesome but front is okay okayBattery Is also goodValue for money

"
"

  Worst product..

"
"

  The phone is worth buying. I used note 7 pros and after this, I am experiencing smooth UI and a lot of good features. In Android, one plus company is the best.

"
"

  Poor camera quality but super smooth phone

"
"

  Battery drains quickly within 6hrs -7hrs of usage battery % is 20%

"
"

  Nice mobile but battery and camera is little disappointing, but overall experience is sooo good.

"
"

  Extremely fast, user friendly, fast charging and 90hz refresh rate is love. Oxygen os is best user interface. Love this phone

"
"

  Amazing mobile, value for money!!

"
"

  Awesome phone under 30K you should definitely go for it.

"
"

  Finger print too much faster and camera quality awesome

"
"

  I like the smoothness ...... in hand feel in wow ........Battery performance qait good more excitingProduct are like it ....

"
"

  Thire is one problem in this device..it's battery life is not good... It's dran battery quickly...Allover battery life is not good

"
"

  Bad camera performance :(Disappointed with the front camera specially.#oneplusnord please provide update for camera quality.

"
"

  Phone is good , camera is good and video recording is also great. It get little heat up when playing pubg type games. But it does not have 3.5 mm jack.

"
"

  Battery life is really poor, it's draining fast. Maximum u can get is for 12 hrs is usage is normal.Even during sleep battery is getting drained.

"
"

  Battery downs faster , Camera quality good but in portrait mode the photo clicked little bit black and white type,.  Fingerprint sometimes reads slowly

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is quite fast, battery life pretty impressive and camera quality is quite ok though but it can be improved by ota updateds in future

"
"

  Front camera  and battey life is very poor quality .front camera low light condition quality iss very very disappointing plez fix oneplus giving update

  Its very smooth to use .sometime the fingerprint show a delay but its good and the battery life and camer quality is average with other OnePlus devices

"
"

  Phone is too much ridiculous. Amazon cheat with us no battery life going good, no camera is good nothing going good I‚Äôm not satisfied with this product

"
"

  Battery life is average, this is value for money, and a little warmth.Cameras quality is very poor, please correct this fault by software update.

"
"

  First of all need to fix the bugs ..Frant camera not clearBattery backup not goodSometimes automatically switch off

"
"

  Using it for past one week. Smooth experience, camera quality is good. Battery drains a little fast, but thanks to the warp charging.

"
"

  Slow motion and nightscape modes are disaster except these camera is niceDisplay is smooth,ram management is good,gaming is average,fast charging

"
"

  Above average..Not the beast or the best. Hope few of the issues will be addressed through software updates.

"
"

  My app are automatically getting restarted please do same thing about that.. and also the green tende effect

"
"

  Pros: camera, processor, display, 30w chargerCons: worst battery backup (10-12 hours only), no headphone jack, single speaker.

"
"

  Third class mobile phone

"
"

  I recommend to all can be purchased without any hesitation. :)Camera, battery, design everything is top class.

"
"

  I got this mobile on 24 August, after that I have charged full battery but I am seen after 22 hours battery is dead.

"
"

  Cheap and bestOsm futuresBest experienceFingerprint super fast openBattery life unbelievableCamera quality wonderful

"
"

  Camra quality is avragePhone battery is draining too soonI am editing the review after 25 day useNo network detacted in sim 2

"
"

  The phone is too awsum.. Very handy,very fast...The look is awsum

"
"

  The smartphone features are too hyped up. It's not that amazing a smartphone. I will recommend go for Samsung A80 or some other smart phones.

"
"

  Excellent Smart phone,Thank you oneplus....üëèüëèüëè

"
"

  Value of money. But still, I feel battery life is less.

"
"

  Just go for it feels like a premium phone haptic feedback is nice 90hz snapdragon 765 is good not as much as the 800 series but still it feels premium

"
"

  They promised to give gifts on pre order...And didn't even give any.. Although I paid for the order at time of pre order...Don't fulfill what they say

"
"

  The battery drains fast even after the latest update. I charged it fully in the afternoon and by evening is was only 25% battery even without gameing.

"
"

  There are some heating issues. But camera is better than expected.

"
"

  One Plus never disappoints you üôÇ

"
"

  Best product 1number

"
"

  Loved the new Nord! I bought the blue one at around 22k with all possible discounts. Great value for money!

"
"

  Pros : good camera, battery life,Cons : no automatic call recorder, ambient light sensor not working properly

"
"

  Excellent Mobile.. My son is so happy and so am I.

"
"

  Worst phone ever,not even one month over and the screen is damaged

"
"

  Best phon in this price .

"
"

  Nice product value of money , attractive packageing

"
"

  App lock not separate , wn we create app lock they are taking app lock as screen lock ,Bluetooth prblm, call recording prblm, app lock prblm

"
"

  Too much heavier... Heating problem..and main think is screen resolution is very bad...  I thinks it's not amoled.. overall it's bad product

"
"

  Phone seems to be nice, when i received the it has little bit scratch on screen guard. Box was also little damaged. Other wise phone is good

"
"

  The phone is nice .the camera could have been better . There are a few software bugs but overall a decent phone. Love the refresh rate on the display

"
"

  After a long tym nearly 15 yrs... I changed my brand choice from Samsung to One plus.... Nord is awesome...More than Expected at this price !!!

"
"

  Overall phone is quite good but sometimes it have heating issue which I never expect from oneplus. Camera is brilliant and battery is also very good.

"
"

  Worth the money. There are no issues regarding the phone. According to me it is the best phone of the year. Superb oxygen os and camera quality also.

"
"

  Got the damaged product. Slide button is not working properly.. and you guys not even replacing the product.. worst response from your support team..

"
"

  Phone had a very major fault ...it has  automatically reset  repeatedly...who that all save file deleted due to reset phone pl change the this device

"
"

  It's not even 20 days I bought this phone and the back glass broke. It didn't even fell and don't know how. The durability and quality is really bad.

"
"

  I used this phone 2days there is a display problem. Worst mobile i have seen,customer service also not responding properly for refund or replacement.

"
"

  90 hz refresh rate is smooth and the battery life is very sumptuous for my needs as charge my phone once in two days. Warp charge is incredibly fast.

"
"

  Value for money phone best cameras in this segment best display in this Price range.. Finger print is also so fast all over best package under 28k.!!

  Please check before you buy, the phone has serious call disconnect issues. The calls continues to get disconnected even after upgrades etc.

"
"

  worst battery life ever had in my life wth a oneplus phone. worst experience ever. does not last for at least 12hrs for full charge. dont go for it.

"

"
"

  This device is beast......everything is perfect and if uh r a pubg player, then do but it.....graphics are beast......i will give 100 out of 5 stars

"
"

  No sound inject point. Only bluetooth connection. Also no side fingerprint. Internet not works properly. Automatic net page hangs.Rest all ok.

"
"

  Except camera everything is just perfect.camera quality needs to be improve.hope it gets fixed in future.

"
"

  Camera quality is good. This  device is operated by Oxygen os is much better than other operating systems

"
"

  excellent mobile with excellent performance

"
"

  I like this product very much and its camara is awesome.

"
"

  It's heating up after watching 2 hours YouTube

"
"

  Everything is good. Camera could have been better. No serious display issues

"
"

  Nice and sleek, easy grip, great camera quality but battery backup is poor, all over 28 k is Noth worth for this product.

  Pretty much everything u could ask for at a pretty great price

"
"

  Phone has the best UI ,I ever useBattery is little lower

"
"

  Camera not GoodFront & Back camera not up to the mark...

"
"

  Perfect phone

"
"

  Camera quality is not worth buying this phone. Even after paying 30,000 rupees, camera quality is so poor. Pics show grains on zooming up.

"
"

  Front and rear camera is not good... Anyone can expect a good camera in this price range... But very disappointed, dissatisfied with this product..

"
"

  Silky smooth. Afraid of blue marbel color but after unboxing it's look cool and premium segment phone. Thanks 1+ and Amazon. Go for 12/256 version.

"
"

  It has not even been 20 days and my phone is already showing problems. There is some problem with the mic. The voice echos during  every phonecall.

"
"

  Don't buy this product.The network is getting turned off while making call and receiving call.Returning of mobile is also not possible.

"
"

  Camera,screen,fingerprint,charging speed is very nice but the battery is just a littel in the down side. Everything other than battery is spotless.

"
"

  This is my first one plus and it's amazing phoneAll features are very good , I think you want to buy at this budget then it is perfectly fine

"
"

  Ash gray phone is great üôÇ üòâ colour . Its looks like classic. Phone to all the best youngsters. Camera quality is  great with 90hz refresh rate...

"
"

  Mobile Internet,  Bluetooth connectivity have  major issues. I am fed up in few days. . Hope One Plus team can resolve my problem

"
"

  Really good phone in this price segment. Initially I had gives bad review. But changing it after using it for 3 days. Nice phone.

"
"

  Battery could be more powerful

"
"

  Display and performance are superb. Camera is not upto the mark. But you cannot ask more for the price of 27999.

"
"

  Battery life is not sufficient as per my nomral usage too.i have to recharge at 8 or 9 pm

"
"

  Finger print one fast... battery life good..wrap charger just wow...camera quality should be better...other wise a premium feeling.

"
"

  There is dust inside my nords camera lenses what to do now !!

"
"

  Very nice oneplus nord good looking smooth mobile very good performance 2 months I am like oneplus nord thankyou oneplus

"
"

  Overall a good buy, camera need to improve

"
"

  Average mobile phone

"
"

  Good experience

"
"

  Nice only problem I'm facing is of battery drainage lil faster although I'm a 24√ó7 phone user. So mine drains faster. Other wise camera impressive

"
"

  Back & Front Camera is super awesomeBattery life is goodFingerprint is goodOverall I'm happy & satisfied with this one üòå‚ú®

"
"

  Overall performance quality is osmI would like to say this phone is worth a thousand words..And thanks to Amazon for being punctual ‚ò∫Ô∏è

"
"

  Some technical issues like camera pic are some time hazy; sometime incoming call not showing on display only viabrate; sometime  calling issues...

"
"

  specifically keeping ""the Dad"" in mind... very content with speed, space and mostly avg battery life.. for the technologically-challenged

"
"

  Camera -4/5Display-5/5Size. -5/5Performance- 4/5 If you are 1st time OnePlus user you shouldn't have any problems

"
"

  ¬†Even while checking feed on my chrome, while using whatsapp, myntra, prime video mobile lags

"
"

  Really go for oneplus nard with out any doubt

"
"

  Waste product.. Waste camera waste performance waste battery and dead in 3 days of use returned it waste don't buy it please....

"
"

  Worst mobile...too much heat and lag while playing freefire game....not even exchanging mobile after complaining. Dont buy if ur a gamer.

"
"

  The nord is the worst except the camera. There is huge network issue in the phone. After every call for 30 seconds ur network will go. Lost money.

"
"

  Everything is quite good. Value for money. No disappointments.

  OnePlus is the only brand which is known for it's unmatched performance.üî•

  Every thing is fine üôÇ

"

  Camera pictures are getting blurred ...that's the main problem

"
"

  Overall Gud At this price.. Good camera quality bt not tht clear if used in snapchat... Battery charges quickly bt battery life is not soo long..

"
"

  Fingerprint scanner is greatBattery life because of fast charge it's goodCamera quality for front camera it takes time to read image.

"
"

  Battery life is bogus...like cheap phone.....it gets charge in less time and discharge in the same way .....fingerprint.on screen takes time.....

"
"

  Phone is awesome. It's giving premium feeling. OXYGEN OS is BEST.Negetive üåü for #Amazon Delivery. They took 16 days to deliver th product.

  Oneplus nord is a good midrange phone.Pros: display, OS, semi premium looksCons: Battery life is poor, camera quality could be better

"
"

  Camera quality is OK. But i am facing slow charging issue in this phone after only 10-15 days. Now it is taking more than 2 hours in full charge.

"
"

  Worst product I had , camera quality is very poor, battery back up not up to markDon't expect from one plus, this type of quality.

"
"

  Best phone for the priceFeels like an SD 800 series chip , maybe you'll notice it in gaming , but for day to day usage it's great.

"
"

  One of the best phone in 30k segment

"
"

  Over all goodMacro lens is not good...

"
"

  Excellent NightScape.. & battery life but should be improve Macro camera.. nice Oxygen OS.. Overall good experience

"
"

  Value for money...Best 5g device in the price range...

"
"

  An average product buy oneplus . Battery life not up to mark

"
"

  Awesome phone, camera is good. Worth

"
"

  765G better performance with oxygen os . Plastic frame was very disappointing.better rear and selfie camera except macro camera

"
"

  It's very very good mobile for this price. Good thing is 5G support

"
"

  I didn't find any Plus factor except Camera if I compare with MI product rather battery is not at per.

"
"

  The phone has battery life of just 5-6 hrs.

"
"

  Worst lls don't waste moneySpeaker issueRecording issue

"
"

  Superb phone, the camera is a little too smooth , but otherwise go for it

"
"

  Not every app can be viewed in full screen in landscape mode. May be fixed in further updates.

"
"

  Expected more but I am using first time one plus mobile

"
"

  Awesome product in this range .super camera .

"
"

  AMAZON Showing Wrong MRP(37,999) of this Product, Actual MRP is also 29,999/-.MisGuiding the public by giving wrong Information about MRP.

"
"

  It's only overhyped smartphone. There are so many options are available in market in this price range. I returned back my smartphone to company.

"
"

  Don't waste money for this...major problem, phone factory reset by itself. In 10 day this happen to me twice and service centre no always busy..

"
"

  I have a doubt whether it‚Äôs original or duplicate phone. The packaging and phone is sleek but the battery life is just 15mins after full charge.

"
"

  Wow it's amazing phone I really like it ,worth for it price

"
"

  Amazing ...... really it is the best smartphone under this price by OnePlusBuild quality and features are great ........

"
"

  This phone is the best smartphone in this mid range category.

"
"

  Overall good, not for intense gaming, cameras are pretty good and battery backup last one day. But pricing is little expensive

"
"

  Nice . 3.5 j audio jack port missing.

"
"

  Superb one..oneplus is just wow

"
"

  Awesome in this price range‚úîÔ∏è

"
"

  Worth buying

"
"

  Excellent phone with nice specs. Good camera and battery backup. Speed is also goog and overall good value for money.

"
"

  I love üíï the phone every thing is good but Amazon got very late delivering it and I was not happy how late they were

"
"

  Overall nice experience so far. Optimal width for handholding. Slightly bulky but lower width make it better to hold.

"
"

  Finger print is good , battery life is average and  camera quality is worst. In every piece you will get some defect and you will face problem.

"
"

  I like all about it only one dislike problem its not give me speed on my sim data network if i insert sim other devices so it was good working.

"
"

  This phone display and touch has serious issue. Several users are reporting same problem. DO NOT BUY IT. I made wrong choice to choose Oneplus.

"
"

  Fingerprint took 2 sec to open, that's same for all the phones. Battery life is moderate and you can count on camera too.. wonderful capturing,

"
"

  Battery life is very weak.....full battery can't survive for 24 hours also even the usage is low than too....very disappointed with it

"
"

  Camera quality super

"
"

  offter 10days use this mobileCameras:superBattery: little bit drain fastlySignals.call.spkers.: superDisplay:90hz super

"
"

  display issue and debth 3rd camera it is not working and heating issue condinasly 2 hwr play  game and other and other features are almost good

"
"

  OkokCamera quality is not as expectedWorst experience with Fingerprint reader but face unlock is good

"
"

  the mobile is very attractive and looks premium and the camera quality is awesome and trust me if once if you buy this phone you will love the oxygen os

"
"

  This product is very good but in this product I have a lot of Bluetooth problem, I want to do the most work on its Bluetooth.

"
"

  DrawbackTorch and other icons get activated while talking. Think slow or poor proximity sensor

"
"

  Front camera is wrost , please never buy this mobile , front camera is poor , very bad quality image ,  one plus 7 is better than this mobile .

"
"

  Very very good game best battery üëç camera üëç ever good I'm happy

"
"

  Really nice smart phone üì± smooth and  fast

"
"

  Battery life is low but it's compensated by super charging speed. Performance and camera quality are good feels good

"
"

  Worst camera i ever seen in this range of phones...Oneplus took it's quality literally down in camera quality.

"
"

  Proximity sensor not working. Screen not automatically off when call to someone.

"
"

  I have display issue like green tint on top ND blue tint on bottom , may one plus fix this in update? orCan I replace or ask for refund?

"
"

  Phone is overall good..but not getting to know phone gets heat some time.writing this review after using 2daye...plan of returning the mobile.

"
"

  So much excited about the Nord . But after getting I am not happy . Front Camera is useless . My redmi note 8 pro camera is better than Nord .

"
"

  Worst device I have ever purchased I am facing problem with this device but no one can resolve the issue...Very worst product..

"
"

  Fingerprint scanner disappears sometimes and battery is not very cool but charges very fast.

"
"

  The camera is too worst except camera everything is awesome

"
"

  Selfie camera could be better..Nice phone in this segment

"
"

  Battery life and front camera is the major problem nothing else u can say anything about everything is great leaving those 2

"
"

  Fingerprint Little bit slow...but negligable..When you use on 90 hrz battery will drain faster as compare to 60 hrz...

"
"

  Everything is just awesome.but camera quality should improve more.but from all side I loved‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫this product very mucchhh‚ù§Ô∏èüëç

  Poor Camera and Battery! So disappointing

  Finger print is same from the other phone. Battery drain fast and camera is good but not to be appreciated.

"
"

  Performance Good Display Good Camera good  software good Battery Good what else do you expect from a device

"
"

  Face unlock is very good!! At the same time after 15 days my Google play store isn't working they didn't download any app....

"
"

  As the name suggest one plus is an overall a best phone...the battery charges from 0to100%in 40mins

"
"

  One of the best phone in Oneplus.

"
"

  Very good phone .....its handy and light weight

"
"

  Poor quality phonNot good batteryAnd display not workperfectlywest for money

"
"

  My display is not working fine half of the display is not working. anybody else facing similar issue. ? Not even one day use it is ridiculous

"
"

  Battery is draining so fast and I did not expect this from one plus. Now there is no return policy also.....Better don't buy this model

"
"

  The best smartphone under 30k price segment.camera quality is good.ultra smooth smartphone.speakers are very loud and clear.good job Oneplus.

"
"

  Really i love it, best phon in this price range, and oxygen os performance is azm... Thankz AmazonNote: delivery yime is too long

"
"

  My mobile automatically factory resets while I take OnePlus Nord from my pocket.It happened four times in a day.All my data lost.

"
"

  Product is goodValue of moneyStylist goodFeather touch quality is goodNot bad battery lifePhoto quality is good

"
"

  Worth buying it. Nice sound quality and quality snaps can be taken. Very fast processor. I am writing this review after using it for a month.

"
"

  Battery problem.Still waiting for replacement but vendor refused.Shocking this big companies refuse to change damage it.

"
"

  Many bugs in the phone software something hanged on rough usage but for 1 -2 seconds onlyNeed to improve general software bugs

"
"

  Phone is having some network issue, like calls got disconnected, network is showing unavailable. Major problem i am facing currently

"
"

  Good choice. Not changing phone regularly. Smooth functioning, doing well in routine work like browsing, social website, gaming etc.

"
"

  Nice product , great experience with oxizen OS, and 90 Hz refresh rate..Camera perfomance is good ,not upto that level..

"
"

  Superb.. mobile..Display quality awesome .Battery life average..Camera verithanam...Overal 8/10

"
"

  It just a day I got my Nord delivered and now I am unable to remove the phone from vibration mode... Unsatisfied and looking for turnaround..

"
"

  Poor, worst product is of One Plus brand. I wasted my money by buying one plus nard, I tell you all request that you do not buy one plus nard

"
"

  Too fast fingerprint.Night mode camera is just gorgeous.Alert slider is lovely.

"
"

  Overall a good packBut very weak battery it cannot handle minimum working hours

"
"

  Nice üëçproduct.. Best price seller for one plus fans.. It's 5g phone.. Best value for money

"
"

  Overall good

"
"

  Can mind-blowing experience n nightscape super ,n performance we all know about one plus üòä

"
"

  Finger print reader is not that far as compared to back positioned one

"
"

  big problem battery quickly drain

"
"

  Very nice mobile phone  highly recommend to purchase

"
"

  The rear camera is very good and the front camera is ok ok.The screen smoothness is awesome.Worth for the money. Go for it

"
"

  best mid range smartphone with compact features.

"
"

  Elegant. Smart. Fast.Did not expect such a good quality and performance for such a low price.Well done OnePlus.

"
"

  Before I used OnePlus 7T, compare to Nord I am totally disappointed.. I am not satisfied quality nd performance also slow..

"
"

  The battery life should be atleast 4500 mAh. Overall its working well. Heavy games works well on the phone , camera is good

"
"

  Proceserar slow

"
"

  Don't buy right now it has lots of bug and display issue

"
"

  Nice Oneplus Nord I m so happy .

"
"

  This phone is the Simple definition for value for money.

"

  Good product in this price range

"
"

  An all rounder phone with great performance and display.

"
"

  Good camera quality superb

"
"

  Nice one & value for money

"
"

  Fingerprint is very sensitive and all others features are good.

"
"

  It got stuck on 2ndday of purchase though it has replacement option amazon service is bad in communication i want refund the product was bad

"
"

  Camera has improved aftr recent upgrades but still it needs to improve more....battery life pretty decent & fingerprint reader z pretty fast

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus Device, i was so excited when it arrive, but after am noticing tint issue, black bar and black crush issue too üò£üò£

"
"

  The best mid range 5g phone but only one flaw battery drains more rapidly as compared to other oneplus phones so need to improve it üòÄüòÄüßêüßê

"
"

  Awesome cameraAwesome screenAwesome speedUltra smoothAwesome brightnessBattery goes down very quickly

"
"

  Best user interface Oxygen OS is very good and neat,Perfomance is excellent ,b=Battery life and charger is very good and fast

"
"

  I really like this phone The battery of this phone is good, fingerprint scanner also work fast and no dout about camera is excellent .

"
"

  Not worthy. Using from 5th August the experience is not much as expected. Don't buy it guys.except tha brand name everything else was waste.

"
"

  Cool device. Came with 50% charge. Compact phone. I liked it.!

"
"

  Overall good phoneBattery is okVery fast for regular uses

"
"

  Best phone Eva.. u will never regret buying it,üòçüòç

"
"

  Nice products .But i wanted to open the phone box first but delivery person only opened it to ensure phone was there

"
"

  Other than camera everything is very good

"
"

  A good compact phone and oxgyen os isüí•üí•üí•üí•üí•

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Nice Products...

"
"

  My 4th OnePlus phone. Never fails to amaze. All apps working superfast. Even Fortnite works well.

"
"

  The product seems to be good. But need to use more to find out on the performance.

"
"

  Its just been 10 days and camera quality has turned to be very bad.. nightmode is not working. its not even 10 days and y cant i return it.

"
"

  Everything about this phone is just average nothing more nothing less, however the camera continuously crashes while using slow motion mode

"
"

  Company told that camera part its like oneplus 8 but it's not like oneplus 8 camera. This is only marketing purposes only . This is too bad

"
"

  TOUCH QAULITY IS WORST,SLOW RUNNING EVEN IN 12GB RAM VARIANT N BAD PROCESSOR. NOT EXPECTED THIS FROM ONEPLUS..TOTALLY A MONEY WASTE PRODUCT

"
"

  Overall a good deal. Everything is smooth and worth. Camera might disappoint a little. Due to less optimization. But worth the amount spent

"
"

  In hand feel is 'the best'Camera is ok okVery smooth experience

"
"

  Very happy with the phone

"
"

  Front and back main Camera's performance like below 10k mobile

"
"

  First impression is good ond check use then it's writing

"
"

  It's a good phone at a slightly high price, the black bar and the blue tint exist but only at low brightness and specific colours.

"
"

  Battery life and charge time are not good.. even realme/oppo midrange phones takes less time to charge and have more battery life.

"
"

  Depth and macro cameras are very poor ... Battery drained fastly ...low build quality ... Overall ... Average phone ... Not worthy

"
"

  Waste products, phone primary requirement is call... Can neither call or not getting incoming call... I want to return please help

"
"

  Good phone for this price point. But needs some improvement otherwise phone is so good. Very handy and in hand feel is so amazing.

"
"

  Good mobile at reasonable price

"
"

"

  Overall performance is good, back camera is beast and I'm not satisfied with front camera

"
"

  Plz don't bye one plus Nord.disply issues in one plus Nord mobile.plz don't west of money

"
"

  Doesn't feel like a 25k phone to be really honest..Feels less premium and feels plasticy.

"
"

  Very good.

"
"

  The camera is awesome and its just same like the pro model of one plus except the curve display blue colour looks amazing

"
"

  Phone is overall good and builty quality is superb as I can't expect much more from one plus. Great Experience with Nord.

"
"

  Very good and nice product of range

"
"

  Phone is Amazing must buy for this price

"
"

  Poor battery.and heating issue

"

"
"

  Totally excited...perfect design..camera is awesome..wide angle selfie is nice...light weight...

"
"

  Seriously didn't expect this from oneplus,, worst camera ever.. And there is agreen tint issue.. not worth for this pricing.. disappointed

"
"

  Writing this review after using 1 month of this mobile. It performing commendably in every field be it camera, processor,battery life etc.

"
"

  Awasome phone ,received earlier as promised  good packing , although white cover looks not so good with grey phone and cover also slippery

"
"

  Finger print sensor super but battery life is very poor that means using of net charge will discharge in one hour camera quality excellent

"
"

  The phone is very good no doubt but I fell it consumes too much of charge had to charge 2 times a day . The battery got exhausted too fast

"
"

  Great phone. But there is small green tint issue. But its not actually issue will not effect your daily use. I think you should go for it.

"
"

  Very good finger print reader+ good battery life+ the best thing is the software experience along with the speed

"
"

  After 2 weeks of usage, phone is getting hanged. Not able to perform operations.  Every button response has lag.

"
"

  Front cam very poor quality, design look also not good

"
"

  camera is very poor...Photos r very bad quality...This is the quality of 30000 camera mobile ??????.

"
"

  Nice pick. Delivered within 24 hour.. Till now working smoothly. Prefered over samsung M51. And happy to have it.

"
"

  Little disappointed towards battery life.Otherwise good product.Go for it.

"
"

  Excellent speed and performance. Meets our need,  1 full day battery life.

"
"

  Touch, battery, Design is very good but lacks in camera design and quality

"
"

  The wide camera s image quality is not that great but overall the phone quality and other things are very good but not that great

"
"

  Nord is good.I have not found any issues.I feel that the colour/metal on sides/edges of the mobile are not of good quality.

"
"

  Everything is good untill u consider the price. design is good and handy but battery sucks while gaming(pubg). Note -no 3.5 jack.

"
"

  Best phone for daily usage. but there are certain software issues which are being solved with the updates. Overall it's worth it.

"
"

  Battery backup is not good the camera is also not good

"
"

  Latest best phone. No problem.

"
"

  One of d best mid range phone. Cameras r fantastic but disappointed with d macro camera.

"
"

  ¬†Great performance...liked the camera,sound quality is good over all good phone must buy.

"
"

  Nice quality very nice

"
"

  One of the best phone so far at this price range,

"
"

  Very good product battery performance is not good

"
"

  Not up to the mark as mentioned in specifications

"
"

  Best Mid Ranger Phone... But need Improvement

"
"

  It‚Äôs all the hype made me fool in desperate situation

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  No battery backup battery charging decrease very fast

"
"

  Hanging device camera not working in few daysFace locking function not working wellDisplay also problem to touch.......

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is too fast. but battery is very poor I will charge it two times in a day. And camera quality is average not too good.

"
"

  Battery drains very fast it doesn't last half day also after full charge and front camera is not great as expected so not happy with this

"
"

  Battery drains fast in one plus charger but charge in samsung a51 2019 charger u get good battery back up how it's happening I don't no ?

"
"

  Charging is slow and now Amazon is providing me refund not replacement although I have registered my complaint within replacement period.

"
"

  Product was really good,camera quality war so good,touch is also good,look is awesome,it is my first time OnePlus experience,overall good

"
"

  OP nord gives more satisfaction than I expected butt the battery optimization is little bad and it results in over battery drainingüòçüòçüòç

"
"

  Body and speaker quality is not good. Speaker volume and phone volume is too low. Didn't expect a this much quality effect from one plus.

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  Poor performanceLow batteryNo jack for headphoneNor worth it for 30 kkp

"
"

  if you are camera person than this nord is good not very good, otherwise it is just a another premium one plus handset @ RS 30k.

"
"

  A good 5G phone with all the essential features in such a essential price

"
"

  Good phone and good experience with oxigen os

"
"

  Feels great in hand. Performance is smooth sound is good. üëç

"
"

  For the price what one plus is delivering is really amazing.

"
"

  Amazing..bang with price... great phone...just love it

"
"

  I would leave my feedback in just one line for this phone: Perfectly balanced... as all things should be. üòÅ

"
"

  relme x2pro is much better go for that

"
"

  One plus nord mobile is good camera k mobile usage k but charge quick loss but quickly charge fulled battery life worst

"
"

  Vary disappointed OnePlus Nord not value for money mobile. Chief quality product made by OnePlus. Don't buy this mobile

"
"

  i was using OP5 before this, so it is a better upgrade for me, cannot say the same for evryone but yeah product is good

"
"

  Best features

"
"

  one plus nord very good device very good performence

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is very goodBattery at 90hz is more consumableCamera quality is premium

"
"

  Picture quality is so poor, each pic gets blurred even in 48 MP. No stabilisation there. Updation required...

"
"

  CAmera is not upto oneplus mark. It is very  bad. After software update it became worse than previous.

"
"

  Brilliant one

"
"

  Worst OnePlus phone everPlease do not buy this phone guysLot of issuesGaming ,camera sucksMany other issues.....

"
"

  The worst phone ever by One plus is it‚Äôs Nord series. Slow and you cannot record your talks.Such a worst experience with one plus.

"
"

  There was a need of stereo speakers with Dolby instead of 2mp macro camera sensor. 5mp sensor should be replace with a telephoto lenses.

"
"

  Back camera is good but front camera is not good battery backup is very good charging is also very fast overall good phone in this range

"
"

  Screen use time is very less without playing any games and processor is old Snapdragon 765. One Plus 7 have higher version of processor.

"
"

  Calculator not working properly and overall not bad this phone

"
"

  Display gray tint appeared when setting black wallpaper on lockscreen (set brightness to low).

"
"

  Faced Purple tint issue on my recently bought one plus nord when brightness lowered below 20%.

"
"

  Fingerprint and face unlock system not works quickly and every time..., Else mobile is good...

"
"

  This phones battery drains so quick,and it's just an average phone nothing more than that...not much satisfied

"
"

  ¬†Camera quality is good nightscep mode is epic . battery life is average. One day backup ...

"
"

  Amazing phone ....1+ really have a great processor with superb camera quality and a long lasting battery life. I just loved it.

"
"

  Hanging problem after downloading a scanner from play store. I completely disappointed with this one plus Nord 12 gb ram phone.

"
"

  Good performance and display , but it should have been better in terms of camera quality and battery life, but overall its okay

"
"

  Good buy

"
"

  Slightly facing network issues some times...

"
"

  Great camera.. and that alert slider is best..

"
"

  Very nice and powerful..

"
"

  Looks like battery life reduced fast.

"
"

  Bluetooth gets disconnected automatically and sometimes it never gets connect at all. not expected this from one plus.

"
"

  Above average product in this price range, over all good, not focosing on any single specification , Total all rounder

"
"

  Awesome mid-range phone , for the given specs, 12 + 256 GB variant offers lightning speed.

"
"

  While startup it is showing application error

"
"

  Very Nice phone , Good camera quality

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is awesome, great phone.

"
"

  Awesome carema quality and the night scape is superb.

"
"

  Battery drainage very fast, finger print reader not work properly,Not satisfied with this phone

"
"

  Good instrument, stable, looks nice and UI is very good to operate, overall a good phone - please buy

"
"

  It is best in performance. I haven't feel any leg yetBut the battery is heating when m playing game and the camera isn't worth it

"
"

  Its a above average flagship mobile battery, camera, performance,  build quality, speed are above average only not a pure flagship one.

"
"

  Best battery, best camera, smooth gaming experience, display quality üòç awesome, sound quality best. All over best phone in mid range..

"
"

  Camera is a disaster but for performance is at it's best, never settle when coming to speed but Nord settled and compromised on camera.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is sligt slow but face recognition Is to fast. Other all features is best in class. Best choice in budget under 30k.

"
"

  The phone is getting over heat with just little use.

"
"

  The only thing which is slow about it is its fingerprint scanner and what was the point of that macro camera.

"
"

  After usage of 15 days, blinking display and hanging calls.. Its very pathetic condition...by spending 30000.

"
"

  Quality is not good .there is a problem in screen.it appears greenish some times.all over it is not suitable for30k.it is ....

"
"

  Superb Camera, display, User interface, Design, Very smooth touch response.4G data speed is very high due to enabled 5G.

"
"

  From the very beginning I am a huge oneplus fan and talking about oneplus Nord it's the best budget smartphone in this game!!!

"
"

  Worthy for money

"
"

  AwsumüôÇ

"
"

  Processing speed good and camera picture quality good. Overall is good mobile.

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is best phone in a range of Rs 30,000 .Best Camera with great detail.Incredible Battery life and power charger.

"
"

  I order this on 6 and delivery is 7 it's amazing delivery by Amazon thank u give a best product in mid range one plus

"
"

  All thing is up to mark

"
"

  Very good product I like it

"
"

  Facing heating problem in the device

"
"

  Auto call record option not working? Why? Plz assist

"
"

  Nice one.... Me also part of one plus family now....

"
"

  Battery problem  need replacement on urgent basisDue to battery issue need to change mobile replacement  required on urgent basis

"
"

  Good build quality. Display looks good. Camera needs improvement

"
"

  Good

"
"

  This is the best phone you can get in 30k.

"
"

  The phone is simply superb in all aspects.

"
"

  It's really nice one of best android phone

"
"

  The best mobile bit camara result are poor

"
"

  I would like to share that the batteey life of my product was so bad that differs from other productsPlz concern itSoo bad

"
"

  It is not value for money .. battery life is very low ...you can 4 screen on time only ... cameras too bad ...not performing well ....

"
"

  All over phone is good but I do not got invoice slip

"
"

  There is a network issues. Calling is not proper. Camera quality poor.  Phone is not up to the mark.

"
"

  All Things are nice but disappointed with camera... But not that much also camera is of middle level

"
"

  Compare to other mobile one plus have less setting options and security options dual mode also less.

"
"

  Awesomeeeeeee

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Battery usage at 90hz drains faster but at 60hz it's good overall really worth money no HDR+,

"
"

  Seems Nord is having few performance issues.. experienced within a week of delivery. Hope would be resolved in next upgrades.

"
"

  Camera clarity, volume control issues as the volume automatically muted, display tint and jio network issues

"
"

  Poor micro camera.... Photos from wide angle are not so clear .... video quality is good ...

"
"

  Improve the camera quality

"
"

  Nice product

"
"

  battery backup very bad and all are better than expected but battery and camera is not a best quality

"
"

  Not bestQuality is not like OnePlus.It's looks like realme device

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  It's a good phone but I think automatic call recording should be added

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  One plus has its own advantage but the quality of the camera is not up to the expectation but otherwise it is ok

"
"

  Calls are not coming new and then. I.e. network is off for a longer period every day or two. Never faced in my life.

"
"

  I have nothing to say about one plus.......brand name is enough...... overall a very good quality product by oneplus

"
"

  Excellent mobile for this price rangePurchase this instead of mobiles with heavy skins like MIUI and Realme UI

"
"

  I love it only the tinting issue very noticing overall the best

"
"

  Just amazing.. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"
"

  Everything is goodOnly my mobileBill ricept not have good condition please give me a copy of the my mobile Bill full size

"
"

  I am buy One plus nord 5g mobile Rs 27999 but in this box not available Type-C to 3.5mm Audio Jack Adapter then why buy this mobile ?

"
"

  Waste of money not 28k like quality.Heating problem is big issueCamera is below average

"
"

  Design, battery life is great.

"
"

  If I take 10 shots then it show only 2 and 3 photos

"
"

  Battery backup is very poor like 2000mah battery.

"
"

  I like the colour and the glaze look and I don't like that ( free fire game ) is not supporting properly in this mobileüò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†

"
"

  Battery of 4000mAh does not suit justify the life ..as it goes just for a single day with not maximum use..

"
"

  was expecting a better camera performance but overall experience is good..! Perfectly matches my demand...!

"
"

  Good product...but not as expected...camera quality is not enough in this price...over all nice phone..üòÑüòÉ

"
"

  Best rated phone

"
"

  Best phone in under 30000 ....

"
"

  Excellent phone for 30k Budget but the back case  provided with phone doesn't protects rear camera,need to buy saperate case

"

  Oneplus is oneplus no other device take this place ....jst awesome camera is superb.

"
"

"
"

  Writing review after using two monthsCons:1) Mobile hanging some times.2) Battery drain problem.

  The product is fabulous with great looks, features & packaging. Icing on the cake is the service provided by Amazon. Very Satisfied.

"
"

"
"

  Tinted display, today only I got this mobile and found this purple tint in low brightness dark mode.Worst experience.

"
"

  Color and performance is not as per our expectations. When tried to return it is not accepted. Not recommended . Looks like plastic

"
"

  Amazing Product by OnePlus ü§©ü§©Loved the Beast Machine with buttery Smooth Performance and killer Design and 30W warp charger

"
"

  I have received this model on  14 Aug. And today the bottom speakers are not working. This is bloody scam. Need a replacement asap.

"
"

  Finger print scanner is not that much speed.Battery performance is OK not that much good.Full screen display has a bug.

"
"

  Good mobile... Loving it..... Charge life a bit low.... And camera is not best and not worst..... One plus is love anywayüòçüòç

"
"

  In my piece got few scratches in screen don't know what to do...when I unboxed I was disappointed to see the scratches in my device

"
"

  Good best phone.

"
"

  Phone is great.Superb display, too good.Design is great.Battery life is decent.

"
"

  Auto call recording missing nd not flagship phone it's average phone under one plus 6 performance

"
"

  Camera awesome, phone design awesome. But fingerprint sometimes doesn't work at all and also battery drains really fastley

"
"

  Network Issue.... Suddenly dual SIM is not working on my device. I was very disappointed to buy this phone from OnePlus ‚òπÔ∏è

"
"

  Good mobile. Camera is not upto the mark.

"
"

  Not the best!!!good midrange phone but the specs mentioned on paper are not as satisfying as the results.

"
"

  Amazing Mobile, You should buy it

"
"

  Good mobile , mobile os is super and fast

"
"

  Battery back up not good.......

"
"

  Though it was packed and sealed yet tempered glass not even sure if it is tempered glass has black spot on screen

"
"

  One plus is one step plus from all brands as compared to price tech desgin

"
"

  Third class camera.....

"
"

  Battery drain faster not even to stand for 1 day

"
"

  Good for display and software performanceBt not for...bettery backup....nd it's a little bit heat problem

"
"

  Bluetooth headphone sound problam

"
"

  Extraordinary phone for midranges budget mobile.starting some camera issues but after update this camera performance extraordinary

"
"

  In this range i think this was best phone ..i really like this phone.. camera was good , phone was good..overall value for money..

"
"

  Handset s k  but am very sad...beczNo return option available on Amazon....very bad ..so friends be careful to buy on amazon

"
"

  Oneplus user interface is great, I loved stock android UI and oneplus have improved on it. The phone is snappy and clean..loved it

"
"

  Good product but some laggy fill

"
"

  Only One Word - 'Pretty Awesome'

"
"

  Please don't buy this product and don't waste your money worts mobile from one plus and worst return service from Amazon.

"
"

  Got carried away with all crap YouTube channel and promotion

"
"

  Its a great mobile in terms of performance but its battry management could be better. It is best mid ranger in my choice.

"
"

  Battery falls rapidly üíØ percent battery use upto 7 hours but charging is fast which charg battery within 30minto 1 hours

"
"

  This is my first experience with one plus. It's very smooth nd fast. Don't confused compare other products just go ahead.

"
"

  Display - goodFingerprint reader- very goodBattery- averageNo green tint issue

"
"

  Os -5/5Sensor -5/5Battery -5/5(2 days without game.)Camera - 4/5(I hope it will be fixed after update.)

"
"

  Value for money

"
"

  Heating issue...during charging, during playing music, during watching youtube.I dont recommend it to anyone.Pathetic.

"
"

  CAMERA is very irregular...Sometimes it produces nice results an dthe next month photos will not b clear

"
"

  Product quantity not good. A thread in camera module and sim card not work properly due to this mobile heating very much.

"
"

  I think camera should be updated ASAP.

"
"

  External speaker not working, I want replacement

"
"

  Everything is good the camera and the features

"
"

  Battery life is poor. Does not last even a day. Every 2 mins 1% charge is getting over and this is just on whatapp usage.

"
"

  Perfect as expected.. oneplus the best

"
"

  bluetooth problem connection was lost some times

"
"

  Everything is good but camera sometimes disappoint in low light condition

"
"

  Phone is smooth but few internal features have been done away with.Shelf is removed and is optional now...

"
"

  Excellent phone but camera quality need to improve through updates

"
"

  The front camera should have been more advanced, otherwise an excellent product.

"
"

  Low Battery life , Too much time taking for charging(1hr48m for full charge), fingerprint scanner is slow related to other models

"
"

  Worst mobile ever of one plus,there is lot of software hang problem.while using mobile automatic stop and function doesn't works.

"
"

  Nice awesome phone üì± under 30k

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is just som , battery life is quite good ..charging process is very fast , camera quality is fabulous

"
"

  Best 5g phone.

"
"

  Not worth for 30k, bad quality

"
"

"
"

  Battery life shall be better compare to all mobilea and usage of hone less means it is continuously discharging

"
"

  Feel good to hold it. Performance is awesome.

"
"

  Camera quality very low, camera quality look like low price Mobiles üëéüèª

"
"

  Decent balanced phone

"
"

  Can't write my expression . It's just amazing

"
"

  Interface is excellent.

"
"

  I'm very happy about this nord... Because it is beyond my imagination... it's a very good product in this cool price....üî•üî•üî•üî•

"
"

  After using 15 days, excellent phone except battery back up, battery should ba around 5000mah, except battery everything is good

"
"

  It's really awesome device. Everything is good like camera, fingerprint sensor etc. But, however it is quite bit poor in gaming.

"
"

  No HDR and ultra HD  for pub g lovers little work on battery and may be any update comes battery and camera issue will be solved

"
"

  I purchased one plus nord 5G through amazon now 2nd sim slot is not working  within one month of purchase I am facing this issue

"
"

  Looks are not that great but the performance is best

"
"

  I love it.. it's very smoothFit in hands

"

  Finger print reader doesn't read at one go but then multiple attempts can log u in.  Otherwise overall phone is awesome

"
"

  Battery life is amazing. This comes at a very reasonable price. Camera quality is good. Overall this is a great choice.

"
"

  Took oneplus nord (8gb ram- 128gb storage) last 2 week back. It already started lagging a bit.

"
"

  No auto call recording . Very very bad  to buy

"
"

  Camera okDisplay goodBattery okDisplay tint issue is there but its not a big problem

"
"

  Good product  But Battery supporting low

"
"

  Heating problem display problem waste of money

"
"

  It's amazing mobile it's camara was ultimate

"
"

  Overall performance is great for day to day task. It's not a camera centric phone, so dont buy with the hopes of a good camera.

"
"

  Camera is good n storage , processor is fast n super ,but battery back is not as accepted n auto call recorder prblm is there..

"
"

  It's good phone in 30k budget and no any issue till now . Also camera clarity is good .and phone charge 75% in only half hour .

"
"

  Finger print is too good and camera quality is also nice.......a bit improvement might be helpful for longer running of battery

"
"

  Overall great for this budget main highlight is its 4G with Amoled and obviously Oxygen os . And pretty much compromised device

"

  Battery drains out really quick. However, turbo charger will charge your phone in 45 mins. Still how many time you will charge?

"

  Open product, return done however replacement not received even after 10 days

  Everything is good .charging is so fast, fingerprint reader excellent, And there should be more work on front camera.

"
"

  Finger print reader normal fast and camera is very good they keep brand loyalty of one plus one battery life is avg .

"
"

  Very bad camera for this price! Could have been better for a 30k product. Too much of noise and bad low light result.

"
"

  Excellent workingIt's been almost 40 days and no issues at allThe phone got hanged 2-3 times though

"
"

  display blocked with yellow lines this is terrible on day 1see attached

"
"

  ¬†I love ‚ù§Ô∏è NORD,  THANK YOU SO MUCH ONEPLUS TEAM

"
"

  I have received already used phone. As I opened it it was showing the saved network as above

"
"

  Battery Backup is very very poor. Don't take this version. I swear Battery Backup only 4 to 5 Hours.

"
"

  I can't see any issues in this phone

"
"

  I have an display issue. How can solve it.

"
"

  Battery life is worse. Not coming for 2hrs

"
"

  Best phone is price range!!!

"
"

  Nice one.... Oxegen os is absolutily magnificent

"
"

  I just love the phone. Photos resolution and clarity is way too good.

"
"

  Excellent Phoneüëç , Camera Quality Best üëçüëå , Brilliant Processor üëç

"
"

  Its back cover is very very weak. It is damaged after use of few months only. Even I didn't know when it was slipped from me.

"
"

  Its been a week now & i can this machine is really fast.In this price range this is best you can buy in current market.

"
"

  Oneplus doesn't have it own dialer and messaging app.. In other phones too we can use Google apps.. Oneplus not required.....

"
"

  ¬†Its worth it! An amazing experience with its features n most important, quality.

"
"

  we expect a lot from OnePlus. But the camera is just the worse of its price range. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A CAMERA ENTHUSIAST.

"
"

  It's my worst decision that I goes on its hype üòïüòïüòünot worth of 30k TBH dnt buy this many better phones are there than this

"
"

  Battery is very low quality and drained very fast without use , please don't buy this phone who expecting good battery phone.

"
"

  This OnePlus Nord is great awesome as well as value for money üòçüòç if you can watch for midrange smartphone definitely buy it

"
"

  Before 1 week my review about node is oneplue one of the best mobile of oneplus. Ceamra and fingerprint both are very good üëç

"
"

  Till now camera quality of oneplus is still worst .....if u are buying this phone for camera ....i recommend not to buy .....

"
"

  My phone keeps hanging and taking auto reset. Very sick of it.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  You can do almost anything a mobile can do and also with a smooth experience

"
"

  Awesome

"
"

  It‚Äôs working well till date.What about the freebies from our Pre order?Havent  recieved any gift vouchers as of now.

"
"

  One week back i purchased this phone,the phone was  Rebooting problem,battery life is very poor, very bad experience

"
"

  Very very bad battery lifeI'm basically user only no games usingFull charge basic 7 hours only can use..

"
"

  Display-5 out of 5Camera-4.5 out of 5Processor-5 out of 5Battery-4 out of 5Design-5 out of 5

"
"

  Worst battery life..... continuous uses ----it will last for 4 hours only.......worst battery ever in oneplus phones

"
"

  I got the delivery in the morning. Its a fabulous mobile as per me. The touch and the camera quality is really nice.

"
"

  The product is amazing and worth of money ...Camera is so good and just want to say you will surely get benefit of purchase .

"
"

  Battery backup is not good. My older gives a better backup. It drains faster than expected.

"
"

  Good phone i have 12gb variant and it is working very fast . Super processor. Great camera.

"
"

  Great deal

"
"

  overall the phone is good . It feels light in hand and it is smooth . But the camera is very disappointing.

"
"

  I think battery could have been a little more like samsung m51 but its fine . Everything else is fantastic!

"
"

  On screen Finger Print reader is best. Battery Life near by 1.5 days in single charging. Camera is awesome.

"
"

  Great phone and well delivered by amazon.

"
"

  Good for what you paid

"
"

  It's a great deal!The oxygen os.A great camera.Good processor.90hz.All of it is a good package

"
"

  The Photo clearity of phone is  not good , im really disappointed from 1+ Nord  as they haven't given the headphone too.....

"
"

  Very good phone @30 k range , excellent multitasking phone , camera very good , battery is very fast charging ,best phone ..

"
"

  go for it..nord is working absolutely fine for me.. everything is just fantasticüòçüòç cannt stop loving.. just love it‚ò∫

"
"

  Face detection is excellent. Good screen. Battery life is ok. Overall Performance is average. Camera is not up to the mark .

"
"

  All the quality of mobile is working properly.Nice mobile from one plus.Fastest delivery.Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  The phone is average...not up to the expectations. One plus nord is not matching upto the standards of other One plus range.

"
"

  THIS IS A GOOD MODEL FROM ONEPLUS TEAM.I JUST LOVED THIS PHIONE VERY MUCH.VERY GOOD PHONE FROM ONPLUS TEAM AT AVERY LOW COST

"
"

  Very disappointed about battery draining rather than good one to bye

"
"

  Waste of money plastic body I didn't like

"
"

  Wow

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Its very nice phone with best camera quality..... If any one thinks to buy it then go for it without any doubt.....

"
"

  Fantastic phone under reasonable price, worth buyingBut, the order reached me after one day of estimated date

"
"

  OnePlus Nord such a excellent product I bought 1 month ago.Battery life and camera quality was amazing.

"
"

  The Battery Charging is Super Fast.The Nightscape camera is Better than Expected.Overall Great Phone üëç

"
"

  :)

"
"

  Really awesome handset by oneplus, better than any other Chinese product, plus it is made in India

"
"

  Till now it's been a good experience with nord, hope it works the same way in coming days as well.

"
"

  Poor battery life, poor focus of camera. No user friendly. Typically settings. No value for money.

"
"

  Good phone.

"
"

  Network access problem.... Processor behaviour like  SD 435G in low network...aera

"
"

  I am disappointed that green tint issue in my OnePlus nord...but evey thing is ok.

"
"

  Top notch

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  In games time PUBG battery speed slow down

"
"

  This is too early to say something about this new OnePlus device....I think it's a very overrated phone & over hyped phone.

"
"

  Seems good with all features and camera clarity..Good build and light weight..Overall best buy option on this price range..

"
"

  good cameradisplay is awesomebest performancebattery life is goodoverall good package in this price

"
"

  Completely worth for the price you pay. It is not be the best in any department except display. But the best overall phone.

"
"

  Very good product, really good quality, i prefer this for all new buyers. But pls check the features for u r recruitment...

"
"

  I am facing issue in conecting network some time.mean while other Phone near to me with same network not facing this issue.

"
"

  Worth every penny

"
"

  A decent mid range phone, but don‚Äôt expect miracle from the device!

"
"

  Worst... 1st one plus experience

"
"

  üòç

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus phone. So everything in Nord is excellent for me.

"
"

  Battery performance and charging is awesome.  Camera I find Samsung a70 has got better camera in same price range.

"
"

  OS is plus point to this mobile & RAM, Processor performance is excellent.Looking & on hands feeling superb.

"
"

  Premium experience. Camera is pretty good but could have been better. I am sure that it will improve with updates.

"
"

  Liked UI, 90HZ refresh rate is gimmic I dont feel any difference, camera, batter worse !!

"
"

  Can't place calls even with full network. One plus nord has serious problem with network.

"
"

  The one and only big issue is network issue .there is no stability in network. Everything is fine

"
"

  It is a perfect balanced phone

"
"

  Nice Product

"
"

  Battery life is dropping fast,you have to charge daily if you are using data alot

"
"

  Finger print scanner is super slowDoesn't feel like i have a 12gb ram phone

"
"

  Battery backup low maybe 10 hours only and also heating issueReplacement process very tuff not easy

"
"

  Really...best budget phn in 21st century... thanks #Amazon for super fast delivery...#thecamonester

"
"

  Similar password for app lock and phone lock there should be different option for both hope it can be given through update

"
"

  Internet goes down even if network strength show fine or one bar down...Incoming calls does not connect sometimes...

"
"

  Before Nord I used 5T I feel 5t is much better then Nord interms of finger scaner and face unlock other wise phone is good

"
"

  Good in camera and all performance üëçüëçüëç

"
"

  The slow motion videos don't have stabilization. Totally unsatisfied.  The screen gets blank frequently don't buy this phone.

"
"

  Phone is very good in price segment. Not found any issue till now.

"
"

  Great phone expect the camera which is not upto the mark...

"
"

  OnePlus nord is very gud phone and this is my first OnePlus device and I love it's performance I love it.........

"
"

  this phone automatically turn off regularly, suppose it was turn off then turn on the phone it take too long time

"
"

  Must buy mid-range phone. Keeping in mind that you have 8pro at higher price, you can definitely go for this one.

"
"

  Phone is very good to use but the quality of the picture is ver bad not up to the mark I dint like camera quality

"
"

  The phone is damn good. Best camera quality. Best user experience. Feels like a premium phone in the mid segment.

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  Nice

"
"

  Good phone ü§©ü§©

"
"

  Lots of software bugs and network issues

"
"

  The camera is far much better then the Samsung phones even the battery life is very good

"
"

  its ok , i am not highly satisfied from its performance, its price compare to performance is low

"
"

  Don't buy this mobile.... Network issue.... Network suddenly cut while in call ..... OnePlus customer service also not good

"
"

  Features and performance looks same as my one plus 6

"
"

  OnePlus Nord is another Great Product from One Plus.

"
"

  Battery is draining so fast. Device is being overheated in just 20 minutes if you watch videos on youtube..netflix

"
"

  Mind bloing

"
"

  Excellent Phone

"
"

  Excellent phone

"
"

  Battery drainage is fast and camera quality is also not good micro  is useless .

"
"

  Product is good but phon is always silent  NEVER RINGING  if phon is ring  mode.

"
"

  Verry good and durable battery life is great fast charging smoothbas butter and great camera üì∏ of 64 mp

"
"

  nice product from onplus.light weight ,5g phone ,color, perfomance are very goodcam average!

"
"

  You will get what u will pay..don't expect 40k phone features with this..if ur budget is less go for it.

"
"

  Perfect phone!

"
"

  Disappointed with battery backup. automatically drain battery without using mobile. Power saver is of no use its useless,

"
"

  This phone is very best , according price and light weight,  smooth experience, and 3 month gaana music subscription free

"
"

  I loved the colour ‚ù§Ô∏èCamera is better than one plus7Light weightPremium lookExtremely to buy more

"
"

  Very poor battery backup

"
"

  The camera is awesome and phone too I really love the phone üòç very good experience you will get after buying this phone.

"

"
"

  Awesome phone and slim phone

"
"

  Network errorBad quality product

"
"

  Good product, although black color is much better than marbel blue...all things are good except Chienese product

"
"

  Camera and other options are good.. but it has very poor battery performance.. other than that its a good deal..

"
"

  It‚Äôs awesome . I like it very much. Very good battery life...almost 1.5 to 2 days.The camera quality just great.

"
"

  Nice phone.. but to open gallery it wl take time..battery is good.. it feels good in hand..little bit overpriced

"
"

  It is fabulous productI can't say any one part of these product cause this whole phone is best in it self.

"
"

  Oneplus give hampers to pre order of any oneplus device I didn't get one

"
"

  Overall good. Worth buying. Selfie camera clarity is not up to the mark.

"
"

  It's really osam if you want to buy Nord then you only buy blue colour it's best colour I have seen üòÉ

"
"

  I think OnePlus make over hype on its camera..it's an average performance when taking pics...overall nice product

"
"

  Excellent mobile. Total value for money. Using from last 45 days. No complaints at all.

"
"

  Camera quality is superbüßêLight weight mobile battery charging and backup superb.

"
"

  Call gets dropped inbetween. Not sure if network issue .same sim working fine in other device .

"
"

  Good & Awesome looking, Google AR service working fine, battery was good, camera quality super.

"
"

  Battery life is not that good. Even with normal usage, it provides backup for 15 hours at most.

"
"

  I used Google maps navigation for around 15 minutes and the phone got heated up like a furnace.

"
"

  I have received my one plus Nord jst now...wowwwwww

"
"

  Battery power is very poor..

"
"

  Everything is good , but little disappointed with the camera performance (3/5) . other than that phone is awesome (5/5).

"
"

  Perfectly refine with the all weapon inside ....Superb camera (ois)Snappy UI (BLOT FREE)Killer battery

"
"

  Totally not as expected....camera quality is worst amongst all the oneplus phones...and even poor than samsung phones...

"
"

  Product is good..How can i get the invoice in other name.ƒ∞n name of Shefali agarwal instead of nisha agarwal

"
"

  Camera n performance looks great but device heats up little don't know why may be after system updates it might improve.

"
"

  After sale service from opo is worst and very very bad. Don't buy this product.

"
"

  Excellent phone . Must buy this one

"
"

  Oneplus Nord worth the Price.It is a great phone at such an affordable range as compared to other smartphones.

"
"

  It's a good phone all together!

"
"

  Inbuilt call recorder not there

"
"

  Camera is very disappointing,

"
"

  Over all god experience with touch, user interface and many more features in the phone. Really love this phone.

"
"

  #Fingerprint readerAwesome mobile, Just go for it if you are coming from some another mobile phone brand.

"
"

  The product was too good for the budget.The only con I felt is ,The macro camera is not upto level.

"
"

  I did not get earphone and back cover

"
"

  Awesome camera,great battery and a compelling design. Worth every penny

"
"

  The camera quality is degraded, not expected by a company like one plus

"
"

  Nord is really an awesome phone , it works like a flagship chip phone , and the battery like us realli good

"
"

  nice one foe overall. perfect for my budget.

"
"

  Good phone good camera quality good performs

"
"

  The look and feel, Performance is very good.

"
"

  As it was my first phone from one plus. I find it almost good in terms of performance.

"
"

  Enjoy clear oxygen os and top performance chip. Needs improvement in camera department

"
"

  Great product available in this segmentEspecially optimisation of oxygen so is excellent

"
"

  Best phone, Battery life is too good

"
"

  If budget is a bit more better to go for phone with SD 845 or above chipset

"
"

  Good camara and performance smartphone

"
"

  The touch screen is not smooth. The camera quality is not up to the mark. But selfie camera works fine

"
"

  Warp charge is really nice....mobile's very handy...camera is not upto the mark!!Overall fine...

"
"

  Don't buy this . duplicate handset.today I got my new NORD.the display is not working ,nd phone is dark ful time üò°üò°üò°

"
"

  There is no sound in the phone.. the return procedeure is very poor and too long..findly very difficulties in returning

"
"

  Very good product happy with the user interface and love the camera quality very user friendly display is best in class

"
"

  Only one thing till now i have is it could have sd 855 or 855 plus. Other all features are greatMainly oxygen OS.

"
"

  Very good phone,,, premium look,,,,no tint issue also,,,but battery drains very fast that's why I give four stars......

"
"

  Not worth of 28kOverall it's good but if you speak about features like camera battery and connectivity it's poor!

"
"

  All things are good except it's battery life.Battery life is not too good.But charging speed is impressive.

"
"

  Had finger prints on the screen before touching the phone. Black marks on the charging wire looks used and man handled.

"
"

  I love it üëå it justify it's price, camera, performance, battery, and its chargers is superb.. Feels so primium in hand

"
"

  The all rumours of one plus Nord is fake..the phone is amazing and overall the phone is best at its price range..

"
"

  Battery life is not as expected.

"
"

  Good phone for the price what you pay.

"
"

  Bad battery and. Bad cameraI think this phone was not oppo. Oppo is better than nord.Battery heating problem.

"
"

  Camera quality is poor.. i was disappointed with it. I request oneplus to give appropriate software support...

"
"

  There is a tiny issues in screen it means one side of the screen shows greenish and another side is pinkinsh..

"
"

  I thought at first that it will have good display and camera n performance good but not that good as expected!

"
"

  Premium quality phone with good display and great crip response. Initial impressions are very much appreciated

"
"

  Fingerprint is very good.Battery is not good.(minimum 5000mah. Battery.)Camera is something good..

"
"

  Good battery life

"
"

  The best phone under 40 k...

"
"

  It takes 2hrs to charge full battery

"
"

  Decent phone in this price range....

"
"

  The phone looks good and every thing looks fine till now

"
"

  Awesome phone for the price. Couldn't ask for a better phone under 30k

"
"

  Quiet an irritating issue. Call gets muted on its own during the call.

"
"

  Poor camera quality and worst battery life...not expected from oneplus

"
"

  Facing Bluetooth issue it is not connecting . I need to reboot everytime to connect bluetooth

"
"

  Nice experience u can buy this mbl without any doubts . I love this mbl @oneplus Nord

"
"

  Nice phone

"
"

  Happy to purchase it, its awesome value for money

"
"

  Very bad product..we purchased on 14 th sep and got it 19th September.. After 7 days(24th sep)  camera gots complaint.

"
"

  It's about 15 days of usage and it's pretty good , fast and clean no bloatware apps found battry is decent not so good

"
"

  Feel premium in hand and performance awesome very fast and camera awesome I switched my self iPhone to ONE PLUSE .üòÉü§û

"
"

  A FLAGSHIP CAMERA , 5G READY ,ONE PLUS BRAND AND OXYGEN OS . DONT  LISTEN FOR YOUTUBERS  GO FOR NORD ITS GREAT PHONE .

"
"

  Battery performance might be better.Reach feel is not coming as frame is of plastic.Remaining is all good.

"
"

  No attractive look... Doesn't look premium phone... I think price is slightly high... Overall I will give 3.5 out of 5

"
"

  superb finger print and display also very cool and battery life it's coming just 8hr only cameras are just ok not good

"
"

  Worth full product...Satisfied

"
"

  Poor camera quality..

"
"

  Camera is little bit on down side other than this everything is just awesome.

"
"

  Loved this piece!5 stars for looks..

"
"

  Very Smooth

"
"

  Awesome phone with awesome specs, recommended to all who are looking for a phone in this price range

"
"

  Not good for gaming as there are connection issues in multiplayer games. No updates are improving it

"
"

  This is the best phone under 30k.I have been using it for more than a month now..And the experience is really smooth.

"
"

  Not meet the expectations.....too much network issues, worst camera quality in this price....looks cheaper smartphone

"
"

  Using from past one month, I can only say worst camera, Hang Issues, connectivity issues etc. Worst phone by OnePlus.

"
"

  ¬†Excellent performance and looks

"
"

  Pl dont buy this phone because battery life is not good and amazone not return this product they ate chitting with us

"
"

  Nice phone in this budget..But headphon jack is missing...only bluetooth options

"

  Camera quality better not good

"
"

  Camera is not good as expected

"
"

  Working good, fingerprint is too fast, face lock also suoer fast in day or night, battery üîã is running well

"
"

  This phone is simply awesome. Without going into details, I would simply say Goooo Fooorrrrr Iiiitttttttt...

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is sometimes slow and battery sometimes very well and sometimes very fastly drain battery

"
"

  Very good all things butSoftware development is not 100% testedSome time some issues found minor

"
"

  Very cheap quality .

"
"

  Best Phone will get on this price range.

"
"

  Not as expected

"
"

  Camera is not upto mark. Performance is just okayOverall good.

"
"

  quick response and dynamic display

"
"

  Expected much more but ...

"
"

  its is osm phone for gaming at all

"
"

  Honestly Worth it.

"
"

  So worst review phone always have warming and hitting problems if you normally surfing also.So bad experience.

"
"

  Good powerful phone. Amazing screen clarity and camera. Loved using the phone and operating system.

"
"

  I am so happy with this one of the best mobile i used ever.Thanks OnePlus for this premium level mobile phone.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor working very nice and battery also very good  and about camera camera quality needs to improve..,

"
"

  I'm using this phone from a month and overall I'm happy with my nord. One of the best phones under this price range.

"
"

  Nice battery backup and very fast chargingNo screen tint issueMacro camera is of no use

"
"

  Instead of nord  buy one plus 7t7t is bestCamera quality is bad

"
"

  Good Quality

"
"

  Macro camera is not at all useful. Rest is awesome.

"
"

  Please don't prefer this phone. Wrap charge is not working at all. please don't buy if your planing to buy.

"
"

  Great phone only drawback is camera not upto the mark but it's above average don't warry

"
"

  It's too good to be mid-rang phone everything is go with perfection except mono speaker.

"
"

  just say one word it's awesome.

"
"

  Camera quality is very bad, oneplus nord is not good phone .waste of money

"
"

  Smooth experience, amazing display and the most loving warp charging technology.

"
"

  Not as good as I thought about the product it's not give that much quality which OnePlus provide in other phones.

"
"

  It is graet phone. Very fast and smooth blazes through everything u throw at it. Great camera and fabulous design

"
"

  Ph is superd i love thisBut battery backup is very poor!!I am totally disappointed with battery life.

"
"

  Camera performance is very poor and image processing is damn slowBattery is draining fast post patch update

"
"

  Useless product... Waste of money.Once full charge is finished next time to not changed... Battery is waste

"
"

  The oxygen os is dope. Finger print reader is accurate and fast. Display is amazing and it feels premium in hand.

"
"

  Overall performance is good no lags,with a good spec's.But price is bit high 25000 to 28000 would have been fair.

"
"

  One of the best phone under 28k.

"
"

  Quite ok product and not a excellent product on this price, display issue not a big issue in daily uses.

"
"

  One plus really launched a mid range smart phone which reaches  all your requirements with perfection...

"
"

  I think ONEPLUS should have improvement of camera quality...rest of all features of this phone is good..

"
"

  Phone performance is good. But camera is not stable and battery is also draining so fastly. Not worth it

"
"

  Average phone but better then oppo and vivo don't compare realme and mi because both company are garbage

"
"

  it bit expensive

"
"

  can recommended this phone

"
"

  Snapdragon 860 series would be better at this price point

  In this price segment, we can get better phones than NORD.Using Nord Camera is total waste

"
"

  Good Texture,Awesome Camera,Processor Too Good For Gaming And All Heavy Usage!! Must Go For It..

"
"

  Battery is draining very fast. 100% full charge is giving only 5-7 hrs. For 30000/- it is waste.

"
"

  Simple to handle. Fast charging. Camera it's ok. Fingerprint take some sec. Superb front camera.

"
"

  Free fire game is not working properly.. weapons are not showing

  Disappointed by battery life. Compared to other OnePlus phones Nord gives worst screen on time.

"
"

  Its battery backup is very good. Camera is also good. Oxygen OS make user experience very good.

"

  If you want to by OP Nord so drop your desire.You can buy realme 7 or 7 pro in this price

"
"

  Gorgeous phone. I'm absolutely in love with the oxygen os. Kudos to oneplus and Amazon team! üî•

"
"

  Battery life is good but, should be improve it more to save battery percentage.. more over its all good

"
"

  Look of the phone is great gives smooth touch feel while handling camera is not that good as expected!!

"
"

"
"

  Gaming performance could have been made better...hope it gets optimised through future updates

"
"

  I order this on preorder on 28th july and received by 11th august . Great product.

"
"

  Great phone for this price. Only drawback that I found was a shorter battery life.

"
"

  At the time of opening seal, I didn't find screen guard in pocket.

  Iam using one plus 5 new NORD good but feeling like my old device.

"

  Ahhhhh, I loved it üòçüòçüòçFirst time leaping towards mid range segment and I loved it

  This is my first oneplus phone and I'm loving it

"
"

  Beautiful display lag free experience, I didn't find any flaw as of now it's a great daily driver!

"
"

  Nice user friendly experience...Every thing is good.Feeling better with this device...

"
"

  i would like to return my order, as the phone is defected and has a problem with a lot of settings

"
"

  But the cost is high, can't be afforded by class of people. So Nord is not a low cost model phone.

"
"

  Alert slider have some issue ... Called Amazon for replacement got no help ... Poor service üòû ...

"
"

  So disappointed from one plus.. was expecting some gift as I purchased the highest varient 12-256.

"
"

  Main camera working good selfie not satisfied and battery life is very good for this Price segment

"
"

  Fingerprint doesn't work fluently, battery is only 4000 in the era of 5000-6000.Camera is ok

"
"

  It's a premium feel when using the phone, smooth and gud to handle the handset...  best of oneplus
