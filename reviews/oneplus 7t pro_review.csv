  The phone looks gorgeous....the build and design is top notch....and the display is best in class, amazing contrast ,colour and brightness, visibility in sunlight is perfect,great battery life , ultra smooth UI, the physical size is perfect (can be handled easily).The ultra wide lens take great,unique shots , dynamic range is improved from previous generation,front camera is good but not able to match to iphone xs max or pixel.Bundled AKG headfones sound awesome and the speaker on this phone are loud and sound great....calling is pleasure ( sufficient loundness of mic input and earpiece output)The Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great....but sometime misses as the physical sensor area is tiny....but it's more secure than an optical indisplay sensor.The only weak point is i think front camera (though being very good)Anyone thinking of buying it ....go ahead guys the looks and screen on this phone are exceptional.....and every other thing is great too.

  Got the phone on time (7th March 19 morning) and was very happy with your early delivery. The 1st impression was amazing and the smart switch option was very convenient to transfer the content from my previous Galaxy to this new amazing S10 plus. However after the software updated ,there was a technical glitch. The entire screen went into a black-and-white screen and it was not possible to reverse it with the regular settings. Had to reset the phone with factory reset. This entire process took 4 to 5 hours and this was a bitter experience. Hope this problem does not arise after sometime  again and it was just a software glitch.I have always been a Samsung fan and have possessed the galaxy phones from the Note 2 times.This experience was a bit unnerving but keeping my fingers crossed and hope to have an amazing experience going forward.

  S10 plus true all rounder with all boxes ticked,1.Screen-10 plus2.Design-10 plus3.camera-10 plus4.Performance-10 plus5.Battery-10 plusOverall this Samsung Galaxy s10 plus is a great buy great value for money no second thought, this is my first Samsung phone and I am happy that I chose this phone, first thing is that the screen colors are bright and punchy no phone can beat this,actually speaking this phone is way less than iPhone x which is 77k in India and that phone is no where near this beast, so finally I would say just go for this with full confidence and have a great phone in your hands.

  The product is pre-booked but shows no offer on same mobile number for Samsung earbuds.

"
"

  Had pre-ordered and was waiting impatiently for it to get delivered. Finally, it arrived on 8th and this review is based upon approximately 2.5 days of usage.Display: Simply awesome. This is my first Samsung smartphone with their famed dynamic AMOLED display and it doesn't disappoint one bit. The default ""vibrant"" setting puts out great, punchy colours and images, wallpapers and videos look great. Undoubtedly, one of the best devices for content consumption.Audio: No complaints. Sounds clean and clear. The supplied AKG earbuds are an added bonus.Design: Looks deservedly upmarket with the glass and metal body. For ages, I had a mental block against Samsung as they made the flagship Galaxy series with plastic builds but for the last few generations, not anymore. You positively feel like you're holding a premium product. The Bixby and volume rocker keys on my device have a little play though. Would have been great if they were firmer.Performance: Again, smooth and hiccup-free. Does get a little warm at times though, and not necessarily with heavy tasks. The 4150 mAH battery lasted around 1.5 days so that's great.Cameras: A casual photographer can't ask for much better. Images come out great with plenty of detail, accurate colours and sharpness. Capable under low light too (don't compare with Pixels though). Do try out the wide angle lenses. They are really useful to have.Overall, it's mostly all round great experience so far. Hopefully, Samsung will keep it updated with the latest software and security updates as I intend to hold on to it for a while. Will update with more findings as and when I come across them.

  Product delievery was late by one day but no issues ! Thanks amazon for such nice packing !Starting from :1. Screen quality: As u guys know nobody can comoete with samsung in disolay market . Apple one plus  every reputed company uses samsung's oled display even though they see samsung as its competition ! Its the best in market . Even though one plus and apple use samsung screen they are 90% of what samsung provides in their phones(obviously market strategy)P.s - Use red colour wallpapers for best viewing experience and look !2. Fingerprint sensor : it has ultrasonic fingerprint sensor which 3d maps your finger rather than just taking a 2d image of it ! So its more secure . With latest uldates its very fast and no error . But if u install a tempered glass you will notice a lag of 0.5 (relative)seconds !3.Battery life : People say exynos version is a bit battery consuming provides less screen on time(sot) but i've uploaded a screenshot of my battery life with 8 hours of sot and i think its more than enough !P.s : sot screenshot is not relative ! Sot means hiw much time your screen was on ! If it was on for 8 hours means i was using it for 8 hours so it does not depend on user to user ! Any user will get 8 hour usage on a full charge .Tempered for this phone will be costly !You won't get much cover options !Go for blue it more beautiful than white !Samsung one ui is much better than oxygen os as with one ui u can use such a big phone with one hand only !Dark mode is dope !Exynos version is not as power or battery efficient as snapdragon version but the difference is so little that you wont even notice the difference !No option for 256 gb variant sucks but you can always expand its storage !You get a headphone jack ! C type otg and akg earphones ! What more do you want ?P.s : one plus 7 pro offers all these above listed features along with ufs 3.0 , 90hz refresh rate , option for 12 gb ram at a much cheaper price point ! Its uses samsung oled pannel ! Truly infinity display as selfie camera is a popup camera so do check that out too !I bought samsung because of its brand value. Samsung is pure class ! Popup camera looks cheap plus you won't get strong feeling about its sturdiness even after seeing it pop out and in for 300000 times !

  Face recognition works slow, screen quality is awesome. The most disappointing thing is that camers. It capture images in already edited mode. It turns everything tan to snowhite. I was really expecting the camers to beat iPhone's quality but it doesn't even compare to that. If you like to see your color as fair as possible you might like it.

  1.Do not remove the pre applied screen protector. It doesn't come in the way of the fingerprint sensor.2.Battery is ok. Basic to medium usage at least one and half days.3.Camera cutout can be removed like the ""remove notch"" option in one plus.4.if your hands are small you will still love this phone. Main reason is the screen size to view videos or games.5.if you play games like clash of kings or pubg the battery will last a few hours. As on any other similar segment phone.6.has live message / ar emojis7.company provided back case is best if you want to keep it light.(Hard plastic clear case)8.white colored akg headset with the box accessories.  Good for basic calling and music.9. Bixby button can be reassigned to another app.10. Camera quality is very nice. Both front and back.11. Hybrid slot for two sims or one sim and one memory card.12. The 5g doesn't have second sim option and no hrm sensor. So choose between the two.

  This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with s series and you will.admire that.1. Screen size - perfect for holding and amazing in quality2. Power backup - one day easily with heavy use including gaming you tube camera and calling3. Camera - main high light of this cell. Picture quality is amazing shutter speed is awesome balancing in photos will blast your think and wide angel photo - no words you have to try this first yourself4. Fast charging - nice done by samsung but if they provide wireless fast charger with pack then 6 stars5. Cell is slim & sleek and back cover provide by samsung with phone is nice crafted and fit properly.I have upgrade from Apple iPhone 7 plus to samsung galaxy S10Plus and I am totally satisfied with my upgrade.

  I was in a confusion to buy this or go for oneplus 8/8pro. For those having the same confusion, I'm sharing my review after a week of usage1. Look and feel: This phone looks stunning and has excellent build quality. The phone weighs less in hand considering its size. It has a great haptic feedback and doesn't have any ugly camera bumps. also it's IP68 rated2. Display : This has one of the best displays in the market. 90Hz or above refresh rate is not present in this but I don't feel like its a great loss. Most of people switch to lower refresh rate as higher refresh rate consumes more battery.3. Camera : The camera is also a stunning addition and still holds up as one of the best.4. This is a feature rich phone. It has all the features like wireless charging, reverse wireless charging (I consider this a gimmick), heart rate sensor, Samsung tap to pay, DEX (which literally turns your phone into PC) and many other. I have got used to One UI 2.0, which I feel is very user-friendly.And top of all this, it has a HEADPHONE JACK!!5. Battery life: When I saw the reviews here, I thought battery life was very poor but thats not the case, I was able to get an entire day of battery. But for a 4100mah battery, i was expecting it to last longer. I have switched the resolution to FHD+ from WQHD+ and this gave me a better battery life.6. Exynos is a slightly inferior chip compared to Snapdragon but its not a slouch either. People have complained about heating issue, I noticed that the first day, the phone was slightly warm when I updated all apps and OS but after that there was no issue with heating. I was able to play PUBG (before it was banned in India) and COD and I didn't notice any frame drops and phone performs very fast and there was no heating issues. I really wish Samsung would have used snapdragon chip as it give +1 hr more screen on time compared to exynos variant.7. One other thing I was concerned was, since its a 1 year old phone, it may stop receiving updates in near future but Samsung will be providing OS update till Android 12 for this phone so it's good for another 2-3 years.So if anyone looking for a new phone in this price bracket, this is a great choice as it has a better camera, better look and feel and lot of features over the Oneplus 8/8pro.But if you value a faster chipset, a 120 Hz refresh rate and a near stock android (Oxygen OS) experience and a year more of updates, you can consider Oneplus. Both are great phones and I dont think you will be wrong in picking any of these now.

  Highly customizable, superb display, verstaile camera. All rounder! The best phone in the market.And guys for battery, I tried switching to wifi, it boosted the screen on time massively to 7 hours. Try it. For camera, turn off the beauty mode.

  Very smooth and snappy ..... it feels comfortable and fits well, buy any version guys quality is superb. I bought the top model  1tb storage , 12 gb ramCeramic white. Wow...  Amazon delayed it over a month . Ordered 25th Feb it was showing in stock will reach you by 8 March.... I got it on 20th March. Struggling for the offer also it was supposed to be 2999 for ear buds ..... now for me it shows 4999. I'm disappointed.

"

  Charger quality is not good and ear phones niot given that much quality is that mobile looking like 75000 rupees and given cheep quality

  Its not worth for money. Price high. Waste of money. Camera quality very worst.. Battery draining very fast..

  I am writing this review after one month of purchase, and I've to say this phone is what exactly I've paid for and really worth of that money. Samsung has done many changes this flagship phone compared to Note 9 (i also own) and really exceeded my expectations.**Important Info** The one thing that I was so disappointed about is it ""Packaging"" the seller didn't send it with care (Proper packaging) and its original box was harmed due to shipping but my Galaxy S10+ and the contents inside the box was unharmed.Here is my honest review of this phone1. Display: This phone's OLED display is one of the finest work I've seen from Samsung and the Infinity-O cutout doesn't look weird at all. I am using it for a month now the display is not affected a bit and looks beautiful the color correction of the screen is marvelous and vivid.The Ultrasonic fingerprint is also something new that I like about this phone.10/10 for the Display.2. Performance: 8GB of RAM + 128GB of internal is storage can handle any kind of application or games that I want to play or scrub through. The performance of Galaxy S10+ is unmatched and i don't need to compromise on any kind of performance related stuff. 10/10 for the Performance3. Battery: I can use Galaxy S10+ for about 12-14 hours rapid fire with my heavy usages apps including 4-5 hours for,  and there's 15Watt charging speed to recharge it in a decent amount of time but I wanted a 25Watt charger. Moreover, with S10 series Samsung introduced the new ""Wireless Powershare"" feature, which is quite useful to share power with other phones but it's slow but it's more powerful that Huawei P30 Pro. I give this a 7/10 for not including the 25Watt charger ;)4. Camera: The Triple camera on the back can really make your picture look professional and gives you all the ability to shoot any kind of scenario, the most amazing feature are new.*Ultra-Wide angle shot which allows me to capture a massive amount of details in a single shot (that's awesome),*The low light photography has been also improved by Samsung, because I've recently received a ""Night Mode"" which can capture low light images better than ever but still below Pixels 3's Night Sight photograph but I wanted Samsung to improve it more.Front Camera: There are two cameras ready for you in the front side that can capture amazing selfies and the second camera allows me to capture sharper and accurate Bokeh shots in the Live Focus mode, and there's a new feature.Video: The phone's Video capturing ability is unmatched and records 4K video from rear and front camera sides, and the video stabilization of both lenses is best in the market.The score for camera setup is 9/10 (Need to improve Night time photographs)5. Design: My Galaxy S10+ is in Prism White color, and this is not a lie but the new gradient/hue color scheme on the back gives a premium look to this premium phone. 10/10 for the Design.Note for Fortnite Player: If you're a serious Fortnite player, the phone comes with an exclusive ""IKONIK"" outfit that you can redeem.

"

  Simply amazing. Lighter than most phones of this size. Fingerprint scanner is fastest you can get on a glass screen.

  S10+ is THE perfect smartphone and at 50-60k, it is at a very reasonable price point. The phone is surprisingly light for its size and at 6.4"" it has an excellent form factor. The Exynos 9820 SoC really delivers. The issues of heating and excessive battery consumption have been completely corrected with software updates. Amazing display (the best), great cameras (3rd best after iPhone & Pixel), great Dolby Atmos sound quality, headphone jack, expandable storage upto 512gb, IP68 water & dust resistance, wireless charging, reverse wireless charging, a very good all-day battery and last years Ex9820 is still a really fast processor. Be it multi-tasking or watching netflix or playing pubg, using this phone is smooth & effortless. Samsung recently announced that they will be providing Android updates for an additional year, S10+ is set to keep getting new upgrades for the next 2 years. Considering the price of iPhones or the Galaxy S20 series or Note series, this is the best deal one can get as of now, without shelling out atleast 70k & burning a hole in one's pocket.

  Guys lets cut the crap and let's get straight onto the review. Don't know for what reasons people have given negative feedbacks. Mine will be straight forward. To start with Display, i must say there is no other brand who can stand in front of Samsung's true AMOLED displays. All seems to be claiming fake AMOLEDs.Moving next is Camera - though its of 2019 but S10 plus camera still competes for Next 3 year. I Liked the Video quality which is superb no haziness no lag. Sound output is way loud and soothing to ears if compares to any other Chinese brand (oppo, vivo, Mi, 1+ etc)...Coming to battery Part, i understand battery is 4100mah and it gives you one full day depending on the Network quality in your area and how many applications you have installed on your phone. Any AMOLED screen will last for One full day and this is Dynamic AMOLED screen still gives you one full day with 6.4 inch screen. Which is way ahead again. Think about it.My S10 plus at the end of day status: lets say till 8pm shows me 30 to 35% battery remaining. Earlier i was using Honor 8X with 3750mah battery, did not find any difference on battery part if i compare with S10 plus..Now coming to Build quality. Must say it's far far excellent in terms of Build quality. Light in weight. Feels like Premium when you hold in hand without cover. No need for Tempered Glass as pre-installed screen protector is already applied to the screen. Kudos to Samsung.Last but not the least - Processor. I understand that Samsung should start using SD 855 or 865 chipsets in their S Series, maybe with this Battery Management might get improve.Lastly, I exchanged my Honor 8X with this Masterpiece (Samsung S10 plus) along with the Citi bank discount and got this beauty at 48099. This is my true and unbiased review for Samsung.

  All is good but somehow camera is disappointing

  Awesome product by Samsung.Pros:Very Good audio qualityPhone quality is far better than Apple iPhoneScreen quality and size are just amazingHas reachability featureVery good battery lifeVery good cameraMicrosoft integration is awesome0 problem of heatingThe gesture features are awesomeThe edge panel feature is just greatSamsung softwares such as secure folders are goodFace unlock is very consistent.Onscreen fingerprint is good.Cons:Samsung is closing down its cloud. Therefore the syncing is not good.  Contracts are stored in Samsung cloud,  gallery is stored in Microsoft cloud, so it's mess in terms of cloud syncing if you don't want to use Google services due to privacy.Overall the phone is more worth than the money at 52k

  The best Samsung. People having issues with pre-book offer. Wait for 3 days after activation, it will show up.

  I bought this phone 1 year ago. I am a regular customer and prime subscriber. After 1 year of use , suddenly the phone went blank. I was not able to restart it. Took it to Samsung service centre in Kolkata near Bellevue clinic in Minto park. They told me motherboard is out of order and one thikng they told me that "" NFC is missing..your mobile has been operated before"". This means before I bought it, it had been mishandled or something else. What is Amazon doing, either they are selling false product or something else, 😠they even couldn't give guarantee to it. Worst service ever. Shame on you!😠 Never buy Samsung phones from Amazon.

  HHi guys!I have been using this flagship from 13th march to be exact. I will list of point by point on my observations so far1.So far, I have been blown away by the display. It’s the best I have used so far and it’s the first AMOLED screen I have owned.The only negatives of this display are the edges where there is slight change in colors due to the curved edge display.Also, a nitpick I have is that there is a screen smearing effect which I noticed is a bit more pronounced in Samsung displays. This was very noticeable to me since I use my screen a lot at night and in low brightness. It was not as pronounced in my friends One plus 6t. However, I must highlight that this is not noticeable while watching videos, so I guess its ok.2.Battery life is very good if you use your phone continuously and don't keep it idle for a long duration. Standby battery drain is there more than the competition. I get a screen on time of 4 to 6 hours during my usage scenario. Maybe the software updates will fix this issue and maybe this will turn to be a non-issue.3.Fingerprint scanner: It’s the latest tech right now in biometrics and its very cool but in the end it’s a bit difficult to get it working 100% of the time. If I had a choice I would have loved to have a scanner in the back or side. If you press at the scanner location it will work most of the time but its slower than the conventional fingerprint scanners.The biggest problem I am facing is getting a decent display protector that works with both the in-display scanner and the edged screen! The options are so few and expensive as hell. The one provided by the company is fine if only it didn’t scratch so easily. It been just a month and its filled with scratches. I hope some good options comes up that is easily applicable and cheap.4.Software: One UI is very good once you use it with Nova launcher and Good lock app. Good lock app is a Samsung software that allows you to customize the UI to your hearts content and makes it the best software for me.Nova launcher is my go to app for avoiding using the power button for locking the phone. A double tap on the home screen should do the trick once you enable that in nova launcher options. This is something is wish was there by default like in lg UI but its android and you can change whatever you want to you convenience.I found the Samsung browser the best for its implementation of dark mode natively once you enable night mode in the UI. That was cool. Battery saving too in that.A negative is that the UI is sooo heavy on the system in terms of ram usage. Out of the 8 gb on board you get just 3 gb most of the time as available. Though it’s not affecting the performance by any significant amount it’s just something I think can be better managed.5.Camera: This is the best camera I have used so far. Front cam is very good. The low light performance leaves me a bit disappointed as the blurriness increases a lot in low lighting. But don’t take my word for it. I use cameras only when necessary and am not an expert in the matter.Overall, I am satisfied with the experience of this device.Advantages:1.Display: Best in the business2.Battery: Excellent endurance beast.3.Feature Filled: I don’t think there is much that is missed in the hardware of this. Wireless charging, Powershare, under the display scanner, HEADPHONE JACK!Disadvantages1.Expensive as hell- The advantages I mentioned can be had for a lot less in other flagships. One plus 6 was the best in that aspect.2.Protectors for the screen are expensive right now3.Very difficult to use with one hand4.Idle power drain is there which will result on a drain of 2 % for every hr. of idle condition.

  An awesome phone with great specs and killer performance.It has got the best display in any smartphone.The fingerprint sensor  was slow at first, but a software update improved it and is now pretty consistent.The camera is great, but suffers in low light and can't keep up with rivals like Huawei p30 pro.Battery life is good and lasts 1 day with moderate use and improves over time(AI optimization).The oneUI is also nice and easy to use.The dark mode is useful.Overall this phone is awesome and is worth every penny...

  Overall a very good phone with power packed performance & features👍.Got it delivered super quick as promised👍.Gorgeous display, blazing fast performance but would have appreciated more had Samsung also sold the Snapdragon versions in India but no complaints here just my thought👍👍.Battery life gets a hit for me but can easily cover till 8-9 in the night basically i am a heavy user with lots of app in place, hey again no complaints here as well 😊. However hope this can be further extended with software updates down the line by Samsung😐 .One UI 2.5 (current version installed) is pretty neat but i feel it still needs few tweaking in terms of heavy animations used (u can restrict this under Advanced Features). Overall a very good UI, pleasing to eye.Response time & switching between apps has no lag whatsoever, smooth in all aspect.Cell reception is pretty good as compared to my previous phones, so no complaints again.High quality camera with a bulk load of options...😃Basically the S10+ an all in one phone with importance given to both performance & features along with a good designWould Highly recommend to others..P.S - Still wondering why Samsung has given a dedicated key for Bixby :), nevertheless you can modify it..

  Not upto the mark product by Samsung and service from Amazon.Product wasn't packaged properly, was just sent in Amazon place wrapping without any bubble wrap.  Ideally it should have been sent in a well packaged carton with bubble packaging. Phone box outer plastic cover was partially torn and edges of the box where bit crushed. Inside the phone had marks on the screen and back.As far as the phone is concerned, it has signal issues, fast charging is a myth and takes hours to fully charge (really want to experience fast charging check out one plus), phone heats up and the overall experience for the premium paid isn't justified. I moved from 1+ 5T to 10+ and all I can say is 5T beats it hands down. The most noticeable thing about 10+ is only its display and if the display is only thing under your consideration than better buy a good TV at this price range.

   Let me start with pros and cons -Pros -Super light weightGreat battery backup (24 hours Idle & 6 Hours Screen on time)Wireless charger works awesomeGreat sound qualityDisplay is awesome - You will enjoy enjoy prime and YouTube VideosCamera - Heart of phone and works greatWaterproof and sweatprofGot stress and hear rate sensorsDual VolteCharging time - 2 HoursVideo Recording - All Modes AwesomeCons -Night mode can be improved

"
"

  User manual is not included, box is like it is not taken with care.. dosent seems original product from samsung

"
"

  Finger does not read even pressing it hard. Overheating issues even after optimizing apps . Battery drains too fast. Need to charge it twice a day. Avegare battery hours is 7 hours. Not really satisfied with the product after paying a ton of money. Called Amazon technical department but no use. No refund. Not even replacement with the issues I'm facing. Samsung should change its policy.

"
"

  Excellent display, good battery.Even with 8Gb RAM there are minor flickering.Camera effects one of the best in the market.

"
"

  im reviewing the phone after 4 months of usage! to be honest im very surprised by the camera quality as i put some samples. the battery is enough for 1 day.gaming is cool as i played pubg at maxed settings no heating overall. front camera is ok ok but can do wonders outdoor...i hope you guys like the phone its definitely worth the money !!!

"
"

  1. Camera Quality is awesome. Premium lenses with better dynamic range. Very sharp and details produced are phenomenon2. Display us quality is Ahhhh!!! I had never seen a display like this.What a colour reproduction !!!!3. Battery life is comparatively less as it lasts for half day but the good thing is its provided with fast charging supports. It fuels 75% within 1hr4. Dolby atmos sound quality is amazing,provides you with the surround sound expriance like a cinema hall.5. Overall its worth a penny product, I have never dissapointed with it in any aspects

"
"

  The camera is quite superior like I had expected, especially with its ultra wide lens. The selfie camera, however, is not up to the mark.The biggest issue I am facing is the phone overheats way too frequently. It overheats even when it is being charged and not being used. It also gets very hot if I take it out in the sun, the metallic surface gets really hot and then it's not easy to touch it all.The battery also seems to drain pretty fast, doesn't last a day like it claims. A phone this expensive should have better battery back up. Also takes more than an hour to fully charge despite a fast charger.I really love the performance and the display but I do wish I had opted for the iPhone instead of this one, due to the battery and the selfie camera.

"
"

  I think seller and amazon are shipping fake charger , charger stopped working in 2 weeks.

"
"

  I have received a Worst oneTotal defective productCharging adapter is not workingBattery life is not more than 5-6hrsThe Main problem of my product is screenThere is a Green and red vertical lining in the display.

"
"

  superb qualitytop speedsamsung ui is so friendlyi love samsung's flagshipsplz go with itmarket leadingdon't buy iphone this is beauty

"
"

  Overall S10+ is good from features and performance perspective. However Battery is not that great. Full day usage from morning 8 AM till 8 PM and it was at 30%, need to use battery saver options. Camera, Build Quality is good. During initial setup and transfer data from other Samsung device caused little heating up but once all done, no heating issues. Overall great product and Thanks to fast delivery by Amazon. Expensive !!!

"
"

  JUST USED IT FOR COUPLE OF WEEKS. MY OBSERVATIONS ARE --CONS: PATHETIC FINGERPRINT SENSOR.OTHER THAN PRO MODE IN THE MAIN CAMERA, U CAN'T SHOOT ANYTHING IN RAW.LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE IS NOT EXCELLENT SO FAR.BATTERY PERFORMANCE IS AVERAGE. CAN""T SPENT THE WHOLE DAY IN SINGLE CHARGE AND YES IT GET HEATED, DURING HEAVY USAGE AND MORE THAN 50% BRIGHTNESS.PROS: FAST, CAMERAS PERFORM GREAT IN DAYLIGHT, VIDEOS ARE EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT SOUND AND DISPLAY. UI IS GOOD. DESIGN IS PREMIUM.CONCLUSION: OVERPRICED. ONE CAN WAIT FOR A FURTHER PRICE CUT. AROUND 55K IT WOULD BE JUSTIFIED.

"
"

  Overall ts is good. Speed good, Battery drains quickly,  fingerprint reader is a problem, Face recognition fast but not upto the mark, Display is good. Sound good, call quality good. Auto Wake/sleep function not found. I have used Oneplus 6, Apple XS MAX also.  In my opinion, oneplus 7pro will be the better choice.

"
"

  I bought this phone in 2020 its a 2019 flagship device it has excellent camera but due to its higher nits (1200)nits battery will be last max of 6-7hours if u r using hevaliy at 50%brightness it last to4-5hours . it has good finger print scanner last year we know that it will get till anroid 11 but this year in August samsang promised that samsang s10 series definitely  will get anroid 12 .there is only one negative about this phone is its battery snapdragon varient has good battery optimization than exynos. No lage in phone its a  Awesome device also in 2020

"
"

  Its been 5 months I am using this phone, seems like every updates will raise new issue rather than fixing previous identified one. Dec update has slowed down camera and mobile badly. I saw in Samsung site many users reported.think before you buy

"
"

  Only handset looks premium but rest which includes accessories are not really worthy of spending 55k! Like seriously? Even after spending so much money to buy a dream phone and we are getting this? And about phone there's a lil feedback - It is burning after using for some time! I switched from OnePlus 7pro to Samsung S10+ but like seriously? My one plus handset is quite amazing in front of s10+. I never really expected this outcome seriously!

"
"

  Well This is my first samsung phone ever , bi switched from huawie to this but i m happy that i did that because its a great deal i got and may b most of the people didnt know but i selected ""Without Offers"" while buying it and got my phone in just 65k. Hope this helps for the who is going to buy :)

"
"

  Amazing phone people looking for one plus models of 60 k better buy this I won't regretSuper fast processor display even competes with an iPhone and kills it as well.

"
"

  Night mode is awesome.Phone is very fast and the display is gorgeous.Stereo sound is crystal clear but not so loud and a bit flat.Fingerprint sensor is slow and inaccurate at times.Battery gives one day of use on moderate usage.Charging is fast but not fastest.

"
"

  Major pros.Beast phone for gaming, keeps COD,PUBG,and soccer in memoryGood security features and also many features of Android 10 already in Samsung.Camera quality surpasses iPhone 11 proMajor cons.1) battery life decreases substantially when heavy gaming or heavy use of GPS2) U won't get a good tempered glass screen because of its curve shapeOverall great phone. Would recommend it.

"
"

  Face Recognition & ultrasonic finger scanner very good

"
"

  Battery is too weak. Won't last even 6 hours on normal continuous usage.Phone heats up too much even while charging. While playing PUBG on HD it was too hot that i couldn't hold it properly.  Front camera is not better than S8+ while i thought it would be amazing.

"
"

  This phone is simply stunning...my first premium level top tier flagship ..and it doesn't dissapoint in any way ... Battery life amazing .. rear camera outstanding... display is enormous, extremely bright and curved edges simply add to it's perfect design... 4k recording from both cameras ..

"
"

  My phone gets cut in 2 secs everytime I call

"
"

  Battery life is just average. Finger print reader is slow and not consistent. These are the only issues i faced so far.Regarding the gaming, for pubg HD + Extreme works really smooth. However HDR + Extreme has FPS drops. But trust me HD + Extreme is very good. It should be sufficient for you.

"
"

  Cons:low light selfi not good.Battery life not good.Face reader not into much expected.Camera have some software issues please update .Camera zoom quality worst .Slow motion and super slow motion videos worst quality  .Some time getting hanging.Camera long shoot photographs  not goodPixels get damaged when zoom the photosPros:Back camera closeup shoot awesome

"
"

  Been Using One Plus Phones (1+3, 1+6T) never faced any issue with Internet Connectivity in my house. But  since I have bought S10+ not able to use SIM Internet Network . from Day 1, always have to rely on wifi for that(Bought This Phone in Mid June)

"
"

  Front look is very good but back look not good..

"
"

  Awesome purchase .samsung can improve back glass qualiy because back glass are vibrate when music play .

"
"

  Every thing is great by the Samsung but the packaging has poor the phone box is in the plastic cover I didn't expect this packaging from Amazon at this price point.

"
"

  Stunning purchase. With optimized settings the battery life lasts pretty good. Got this on a good deal from Amazon. Blue variant is better than prism white model atleast in my opinion.

"
"

   Loving it... after using more than 3 months still i feels performance like new phone. If you are regular midrange mobile user than not recommended because you might not explore all hidden features and services of Samsung flagship device. Battery lasts up to one full day, Camera performance awesome, reverse charging works well and good alternate for wearable device charge but not for full phone charge. Long time gaming might get little heating due to glass back. Fingerprint unlock works well for me. Overall excellent phone as per my opinion.

"
"

  I thought it was an over hyped product. S8+ camera is better.

"
"

  There is a defect in the display at the right hand mid bottom section. A small line than a millimeter is visible. need a replacement please because I want the product but defect free please

"
"

  Great product.Love the overall performance.This is a real flagship(preferred over oneplus 7pro)

"
"

  Camera : 9/10Display : 11/10 (No Kidding)Processor : 9/10Features : 10/10Speed : 9/10Ease of use : 9.5/10

"
"

  10/10 ... in all parameters after 1 months use .. Will review in detail after 2 months

"
"

  Right time to upgrade.Got my pre order offer will activated in 24 hrs

"
"

  Awesome samsung s series mobile.Finger print reader not as fast as shown. Camera quality is very good.Battery easily last for 24 hours with moderate use like calls, whatsapp, browsing youtube, Netflix etc

"
"

  I used this phone last 3 months. And happy with this, the camera is great, performance is nice, build quality is one of the best. One think I don't like is the charging speed it take above 2- 2.15 hrs. It not that nice.

"
"

  Phone is good ,but after a month when I connect ear phones the sound is uncontrollable,may be that is software issue but ,it is disappointing that I got a issue just within a month after investing 70k.When I went to servicing center they simply I need to reset the software, i cannot manage to reset i need to backup. Finally it's annoying while using ear phones.

"
"

  Amazing phone . Ip68 works perfectly this photo has taken an under water .phone work's good but it has heated when you play heavy game

"
"

  Item price is too much when compared to others at same specifications. My suggestion is to buy Note10 instead of this s10+

"
"

  Cons: Charger given is only 9watts .the cable is super short.Phone heats up very quickly.Indian versions isn't the snapdragon but the exynos chipPros: lovely display and brightness

"
"

  10 out of 10. It's worth every penny!!!!!

"
"

  Dear seller battery just weak. use and unuse automatic draining battery backup. Battery performance is low and just bad.

"
"

  Touch sensor sometimes take too many attempt to unlock.Camera and build quality is best in the market.Charging: this much costly smartphone is given without fast chaging sometimes it annoys you.

"
"

  The best phone money can buy.Excellent build quality, and features.The camera is awesome. As Samsung states ""Camera is reimagined"".Go for it without a second thought.

"
"

  Look of the phone is very very charming. Fingerprint sensor is quite slow. Camera of this phone is just beyond expectations it's getting beat lot of Compare price range phones. Battery life is also not that much impressing.

"
"

  Please do not buy this phone, the phone is getting over heated and not working as expected very sluggish and turns off frequently for no reason. It's probably a used or refurbished phone, selling for the price of brand new one. I raised return request with in 10 days, amazon didn't honor return policy. Worst experience ever.

"
"

  Everything about it is quite awesome as I'm an ardent user of Samsung mobiles for a long time now. This one feels perfect in many ways.

"
"

  Excellent product.

"
"

  Battery drains quickly , looks classy but not recommended if you are looking for a better battery performance

"
"

  Worth the wait and money!

"
"

  Have been using for 8 months now without any slightest problem. Truly worth the price.

"
"

  Very very good

"
"

  Display is great, however lagging in battery. The charge from cable takes longer compare to wireless charging, which becomes difficult when you are on the go.

"
"

  Finger print reader is very slow and misses a lot. The curved screen registers a lot of fake touches. Camera is good, but again not the best one around. Android auto is buggy specially when compared to carplay.

"
"

  Battery and charging speed needs to be improved..use dark mode to save on battery..rest the mobile is great

"
"

  Amzing mobileScreen quality is too good superbCamera quality is awesomeBattery life is all day long with heavy usePhone is so smooth and super fastFast charging within 1.5 hourFeatures is awesomeOverall awsome phone

"
"

  Phone heated frequently, battery drain faster, charging little slower

"
"

  Everything is perfect

"
"

  Average battery life. Will not survive one full day with moderate usage. Charging though fast , isn't as fast as other Chinese counterparts.

"
"

  Battery life could be better and should have been provided fast charger out of the box

"
"

  Excellent product. Didn't face any battery draining issues for this large screen. Was expecting dash charging, but ended up with fast charging which is pretty late.

"
"

  Awesome phone. Quility of phone is top notch. Impress with camera performance and phone performance is very fast and smooth. Feels premium in all aspects. Display clarity and quility is top notch.

"
"

  Performance is good but phone is heating..

"
"

  Camera Quality is really bad ... especially in indoor lighting.Even MI high end cameras produce better pictures

"
"

  It was like used phone.. worst... old Samsung box, phone did not have plastic cover... it was like refurnished  phone... complete cheating by Amazon...

"
"

  Very good working for 10 days

"
"

  Best picture quality

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is quite slowCamera is good but 2x can't capture proper shotsBattery life is very poor

"
"

  Awesome device. Monstrous battery life. Easily getting 7-8 hours of SOT on QHD resolution setting. Clear and loud stereo speakers. Display is superb. Cameras are fabulous. In one word it is 'Winner'.

"
"

  Face reading not perfect,Camera is good,finger print reader could've been better ,sounds excellent,speed excellent,wifi connectivity bad.Screen is awesome.

"
"

  Right from phone's screen to camera to all the functionality....it proves that no one can beat this.So light weight..S10+ is crazy🖤

"
"

  Excellent phone with excellent features with awesome  camera.Everything is good in this phone except i feel that samsung should have increased it's battery life more.

"
"

  Price is too much.. battery life is not upto the mark..Face lock n fingerprint isn't upto the mark

"
"

  Battery life is not good

"
"

  Theres few u cant neglect1. Camera 's low light performance2.face unlock not secure at allBut mainly to me Low light Sucks ....Fir bhi dil aagaya isspe yrr....

"
"

  Everything thing is good the problem is battery life is not good n fingerprint reader is very slow same with the facial recognition.

"
"

  Great product.. Simply sooperb. Camera is awesome and the display also. 😀😍

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is not that fastRest I don't find any flaw in mobile.Samsung should improve it with a software push.

"
"

  Excellent camera. Great display.Everything is good..battery a lil bit slow compared to others...but I am satisfied

"
"

  Mobile looks premium. Costing is on higher side in comparison with specs provide should be in range of 30k battery life is poor hardely sustainable till day after normal use.camera is good

"
"

  Awesome but over priced

"
"

  The phone is flimsy and the speakers aren’t clear. Else everything is ok. The screen resolution could be better.

"
"

  Day camera is not that good compare to iPhone 11 pro max  but night camera is very good.Rest all features are OK as usual

"
"

  Its totally worth of everything u pay for it

"
"

  Dongare print not good , many times tuch than open & medium quality not given beauty mode

"
"

  S10+ phone in hand falling is wow  but camera not working his best performance I don't like over all phone very fast I like s10+

"
"

  It should be with in price range of 60k not more than that...camera is good but fingerprint is laggy

"
"

  Phone is good interms of performance,  camera quality and battery life. But there are problems  with finger print reader and battery charge time.

"
"

  My first flagship phone....after used the specific product Samsung galaxy k zoom.....this phone is simply superb, display is fantastic, really beauty to hold.Kudos to samsung.

"
"

  Good product

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  Adapter less powerful, good phone.Only 9w adapter doesn't charge more than 1200mah. Takes 2hours to charge. From 50% charge to takes more than an hour to charge.

"
"

  Phone is awesome quality also very fine only one thing nagetive about s10plus if there was 4500mah battery then no one compete this mobile

"
"

  All are ok . Front camera quality is very low

"
"

  Battery power drains a little due to large screen.. don't worry.. it will last a day.. its enough

"
"

  Amazing phone...fast and intelligent. Loads of features, best screen, best sound, pretty decent camera.

"
"

  Good product I feel price is bit high compared similar mobiles

"
"

  Received within 2 days of ordering, product is great and works like charm. Always loved the new age Samsung products compared to its Apple counterparts

"
"

  Only con what I see is battery lasts a day after a prolonged use. Other than that the brand itself speaks.

"
"

  It is good product from Samsung. Recommended to buy. Amazon service is also amazing. However issue with after sale service

"
"

  overall brilliant product

"
"

  Was worth the money, i wanted this phone in urgency seller communicated very well with us and helped me alot .

  I like most of the things like its camera , rapidlyOpening apps, built quality.. nd many more things.....

"
"

  It doesn't get connected to WiFi. Takes a lot of time to connect and very slow download rate over WiFi.

"
"

  Face recognition is very bad but other than than best mobile in the market

"
"

  Everything is great. One UI is excellent.

  i purchased an Samsung galaxy S10 plus on amazon.in and i have decided not to purchase cell phones on amazon.in anymore. The handset was turned out to be defective and device got overheated within 5 mins of switching on the phone. The back of the phone and sides were overheated and when i called the customer service, they recommended the factory reset but did not help they simply asked to wait for 24 hours to see if the problem gets resolved. unfortunately amazon customer service does not respond about replacement or return even though the return/replacement was requested on the same day of receiving the device. worst experience ever.

"
"

  Few important points which made me choose galaxy s10 plus over onplus seven pro :1. Almost half the radiation2. Speakers twice as good, like really awesome3. Screen almost ten times better. Watching Netflix, Prime especially with there content quality. Ever other screen feels dull after. High refresh rate doesn't impact video watching or in general screen experience, it only makes swiping seem more seamless4. Much much lighter. I can finally keep a big phone in my pocket without my pants going down. Tired of carrying around phone in hand5. Edge screen is an amazing convenience. That''s where I keep the 5-7 apps I use all the time.6. Camera is lot better for a regular user, great shots come easy7. Front camera is way better8. Wide lense is oh so awesome, like really . Try using it in smaller spaces and you will know the value9. Built feels really a lot more premium10. Pop up chat apps and others are oh so awesome to use in regular experience11. It’s beyond me to understand why every reviewer misses on Samsung pay, is it not available in US .? That alone is such an awesome feature and makes life so much easier12. You can plug in a USB out of the box, works as good as a laptop. You get adapter in the package13. Blue light filter is such an amazing feature. I have it auto on after 7 pm everyday and really love how it subtly makes an impact14.  Galaxy buds (separate buy), that reverse charging is really a very advanced tech and a very handy feature15. Wireless charging is a lot more convenience once you start using it then you realize. Putting in a wire just feels very cave mannish now 😁no really16. Another thing I don’t get, why no reviewer talks about 4K optically stabilised video recording ?17. Another big thing, about the cutout. Guys! Just view the phone down the other way. The cutout comes at bottom right corner and you don't even know that it's there. It's a way more awesome  experience than tear drop or having  notch in the middle. (Pop up thingy is just ugly so not even writing about it)The comparison of this phone is more with iPhone X than one plus anyway.

  - I am using this phone from more than 1-year overall experience is good, but the problem starts after 1 year, I get moisture detected message all the time, that message describes that is because of water, but the thing is my phone was never exposed even for the single drop of water. And as a result, my phone won't charge. I took it to Samsung care centre and here's came big deal, boom it will cost me 35000 Rs. I have to change motherboard because the port is attached to the motherboard itself. Do you really think is it worth to pay 35000 to repair just a single charging port.

"

  Verdict: if not for its unexpectedly bad battery life, this was a perfect phone.Pros:1. Screen is the best, after all it's samsung's amoled, full screen with punch hole design is just beautiful.2. Camera is amazing, and wide shot lens actually delivers good results, and that super slo-mo is dope3. Historically Samsung has always been bad at custom UI with TouchWiz, but with ONE UI, this has changed, it is very functional now and looks much better.4. And the best thing is they still have 3.5mm jack, and they also provided AKG headphones with it.5. Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works great for me, though it took sometime to get used to.5. Phone already comes with screen protector installed, and a case in package.Cons:1. Just one, they use Exynos processor in India and many other regions, which is a sucker at battery life. Its performance is great, but when you buy a 4000mah battery phone, you would expect it to live upto its battery size but this phone does not. If only they shipped the Snapdragon processor, I believe battery would have been much better and this would be a perfect value for money phone.

  I was among the 1st buyers of this flagship phone. It was really a good one. However after 1 year of use and all of sudden phone went blank. No charging, no switching on. Gave it to service center and was told that Mother Board is gone! They asked me to replace but I declined and now switching to some other brand. If such a good and costly phone lasts 1 year, what is the point?

"
"

  Bought it from a local store after exchanging my brilliant Note 9..Display is dull and colours are pale compared to note9Also camera performance  is sub par..photos come washed out and dull without any depth ..battery performamce is slightly better only plus point is its weight is less and overall form facter is smaller .. for the price paid  its a big down  hope they will improve it with a software upgrade...disappointed with over all  purchase..buy a s9 plus or a note9 instead..much better phones in comparison..used both.

"
"

  One of the best android phones out there with the best of all features however the battery life is barely 12 hours with 4 hours OST. Carrying a charger along always is a pain in itself

"
"

  Samsung is selling the inferior Exynos 9820 version in India(compared to the Snapdragon 855). It is significantly worse in performance, battery life(mainly standby time) , camera performance due to different ISP(front cam is horrible in low light), and it also heats up more. Pubg performance is much worse than previous generation oneplus 6t. It's a laggy mess. Do yourself a favour and don't buy this phone. If possible import it from the US or else just avoid it.

"
"

  The best android  phone we can have in market.Many benefits.1. 73900 and if you have HDFC credit  card, 6000 cash back and 9 month no cost EMI. Which means effective price is 67900.2. Pre book offers gets ear buds or 46mm watch at 2999 or 9999.3. Wide angle lens is top notch.4. Screen brilliant5. Smooth UI.6. Better user experience and value for money when compared  to iPhone xs max which will cost about 1.1 lacs.Cons:No phone can be perfect1. Ultrasonic finger print works only if your skin have proper engraving else will not work fine. Personal experience as my palm skin is has peeled off in winter.2. Icon pack is really boring.3. Face recognition is not reliable.4. Battery  is ok, use in full HD and with always on in tap to see you will get 1 days battery. Battery charge improved after 3 charge cycle.5. No tempered glass facilities,  it won't work. Only white stone glass works which is very expensive  around 9K in India. Better to import it. Hope there will be screen protector available as the pre applied one is generating bubble post usage.

"

  Overall phone is quite impressive for the fancy use and feels a great feeling as professional.But Camera quality of the phone needs improvement.Also there is no Infrared port on the phone which is really feels bad for daily usage as remote.Battery goes Discharge in 5hrs of playing games and watching videos , looking for improvements.

"
"

  Buy oneplus 8 pro..wayy better in gaming dept and OS Smoothness.Snapdragon beats any exynos processor samsung ships...dont fall for it.Buying this phone a year back...never thought it would dissapoint this much...heats up real quick....lag in game after 20min usage in LOW graphics settings....and in that cant screen record without lags.....truly dissapointed.Exynos is the worst processor....!

"
"

  Awesome product. I think Samsung's first Ultrasonic In Display Fingerprint scanner enabled mobile. Processor is also better than other phones, because it could beat iPhone X's max in opening almost all applications. Camera is also good with improved settings where you can take best auto shot and improved low light photography. Storage is also good and also convenient for a normal person. Software is also improved with new Android P and new home settings.  Display is Amoled where you could expect best  screen quality. I think It is Android 2nd secured phone after blackberry with Samsung Knox. An important new feature about this is WIRELESS POWER SHARE . Where you could share your charged power with other wireless charging enabled phones or watches. Overall it is the best phone since now that you could expect from Samsung.Sorry if there is error in my review. Even though I have not bought it . I have experienced it with my friend's phone many number of times. It is my dream to buy that phone but fate restricts me . Thankyou 😊

  This product is very good. I mean u won't find such a beautiful display in any phone not even in iPhone. Its having the world first ultrasonic fingerprint reader which another best thing in this phone. I'm writing this review after using this phone for more than one month. I can it's a complete balanced phone. Only the drawback which I've observed was the battery backup is not upto the mark like if u r a heavy user then ur battery won't last a day, but if u r a regular ordinary user then the battery will last almost upto a day but at the end of the day  you have to charge ur phone. It's a having a fast charging but but that too its require almost 1 and half hour to charge the phone fully.Overall I'll say if u don't have a budget problem and u wanna buy a best flagship smartphone in the present market then you should go for it. But if u a gamer like heavy gamer or very heavy user then I'll suggest don't go for it or else u have to carry a power bank along with you

  The wonderful phon ever ...to gud display quality dynamic super amoled screen... powerful exnos 9820 chipset 8gb ram edge screen is so good

"
"

  Used the phone today first time after a full charge, battery lasted 12 hrs and am very disappointed, giving it a benefit of doubt due to the setup and configuration of multiple apps - will review this again later in the week to see if things have improved.

"
"

  Every thing is ok but battery sucks.3 to 3.5 hrs on screen time.play pubg it will drain from 100 to 30 in just 1hr 30minuts.and it heats a lot hence its winter what happend to it in summer

"
"

  It’s the one of flagship Phone from Samsung in 2019. My observation is as below:Pros:Looks gorgeous....Display is best in classFantastic screenBuild and design is very excellentIn day light, display is perfectUltrasonic fingerprint is a huge improvementThree cameras give amazing versatilityPhone perfectly fit in your palmSound quality is amazingConsBattery life isn’t as good as expectedFront Camera is not so impressedQuite expensiveWill keep you updating if anything more is observed…..

  I have been using this phone for 2 months now here's what one should know-1. Battery life is good but not as good as Snapdragon version. The difference is about 1 and a half of screen time.2. Performance vise no one can tell the difference in exynos and Snapdragon so don't stress yourselves with it.3. All games will in 60 fps without any frame over extended period of time, thanks to that vapor chamber but in PUBG fps fluctuates till date no fix has been provided.4. Camera quality is excellent but night mode need works and in future updates it will get better.5. Fingerprint scanner works good but with 90% accuracy.6. Don't use facial recognition as it is least secure when compared to other smartphones.7. No lags no performance drops thumbs up for that.8. Punch hole will not be noticed by your eyes and also phone is optimised in a way that punch hole will not get in the way when playing games in full screen but some information do hide like when there is some resource but can't actually see how much you have because of punch hole in the way.9. Screen is just marvelous screen on this is just unbelievable.10. If you use a back cover your hand will many time touch back cameras, at least, with me that's the case and i need to wipe them. Might help.

"
"

  I'm regretting switching from one plus to this phone. The charger is the worst and it takes 2 hours to charge the phone inspite of having a fast charger. My one plus phone use to fully charge within 45 mins. This phone heats up pretty quickly. Not at all worth the lonely. I'm missing my one plus.

"
"

  I will don't talk about the phone feature but I'll share some tips finger print accuracy improvement 1)don't use tempered glass with that thickness finger print will not work use clear screen guard best quality which cost around 1200 to 1500 and when your registering ur finger print in ur phone registrer the way u handle and unlock your phone with 360° movement and thing is if your previous oneplus smart phone user u will not satisfy with the s10 plus performance when campare to one plus 7 Pro or oneplus 6tBecause I'm experiencing it why I'm not able to consider but oneplus user use oneplus only don't use other

"

  [*UPDATE]In April I gave review of  S10Plus . After receiving monthly updated one thing is definitely improved that is Night mode. It is now par with Pixel phones.There are few Hits and Miss but it is now satisfying but rest is almost same.Its a disappointment at this price tag.You can feel the vibrations on body when listening songs on speaker. At this price tag we expect a strong body.Its display touch works with your ear phone cables and other stuff. I don't know what Samsung's accidental touch protection is about.Fingerprint reader is a big failure. Many times it fails to recognize my impressions even after the update.Low light camera performance  is not at all good . All you get is noises.Front facing camera smoothens your skin way too much even after all beauty modes are off.Face unlock is a fancy gimmick not at all secure.I bought this phones with really high hopes but its a disappointment.I don't  think I am ever gonna buy samsung again!And those 3 stars are only for its display and video recording features.

"
"

  The packaging was okay, but many people are facing issue with the phone when they are buying from Amazon. My phone had Heating issue, and battery was draining quickly. But it on your own risk. Other People got used phone, damaged screen, no ear phones or charger, etc. I returned my product.

"
"

  Without a doubt its way better thann S20 Plus with the dual cutout front camera and the 3.5 mm headphone jack. I have been using Samsung phones for more than a decade with my first flagship being the Galaxy Note 1 which started the big screen revolution in mobile industry. Each new Samsung phone I have bought till date have always exceeded my expectations and this one just knocks it out of the field. It is super fast, has tons of features and very user friendly with a feel good factor in your hand, and the nothing to say of the super Amoled screen. It actually feels a million times better and safer if you have a good high quality case for it. The edge edge screen menu is very convenient but I hardly get a chance to use it, in my opinion just gives me some bragging rights. The battery is awesone and last close to 2 days if you are not a heavy user. The fast charging on this phone works flawlessly and charges much faster considering the big battery 4100 mah. The camera is a big improvement over my last phone the S7 Edge which I adored. Taking photos and videos on this joy brings in a sense of Euphoria and the pic are a joy to watch since they are sharper and much brighter compared to the competition. You should spend on a high quality screen protector since the screen costs a bomb if you scratch or damage it accidentally. Despite the screen protector, the screen is actually very sensitive, which is also a nice improvement over the S7 which was much less sensitive with a screen protector. The built-in fingerprint sensor is slightly slow especially with a screen protector and does take some getting used to at first. I normally use the less secure face I'd to unlock my phone and it is blistering fast. Additionally, I have a Gear 3 watch and it pairs easily with this phone everytime I disconnect. With 512GB of onboarding storage and 8 GB RAM you feel like GOD and free to download tons of apps which work with almost Zero lag, it an absolute beast of a machine. The ONLY gripe I have about this phone so far is that I can't (or haven't figured out how to) change the notification sound to a custom sound, something I was able to do on my S7. This phone truly defines style and attitude.

  This is worst phone I have bought in my entire life. It's under a premium segment, but felt like as it should be.Slow charging speed, poor finger print scanner and worst of all, the water resistant is a total lie. I accidentally wet my phone during rain. It shows error message that moisture detected in the charging port. I made it dry for 2 days without charging. But the error comes and goes every 10 days and prevent my phone from charging.I bought a wireless charger and tries to manage with it. But slowly the phone started to show muliplt issues. Search in Google and you will knowFinally sold it off 53 K and bought Mi A3 and saved 40K. My God, I have never been this much happy since then.If you want high end go buy apple or OnePlus. Don't buy this.

"
"

  WoW!Samsung has gone way beyond imagination, s10+ is a dream phone. Its exynos processor gives a tight competition to the SnapDragon 845 processor. Cameras are its main highlights. But fingerprint is pretty wack though.Its animation cannot be stopped and I think it might be bit of a problem in future.Its ram and memory are nice.Battery is just OK but not good compared to other in market.Overall its a great phone with great specs. If you are the looking for phone with great cameras and gaming, its just the phone you are looking for.

"
"

  I bought this phone from Samsung outlet. Spending 73k on this phone is totally nonsense.Poor wifi range,poor proximity sensor, Screen looks nice but not at all durable as it developed a crack after falling from my friend's pocket sitting on the chair,Fingerprint is worst as everytime it will prompt u to press harder,Camera is not so impressive.Trust me guys LG 19k phone is far superior in terms of camera quality. I don know why are they not advertising it's feature.Not at all worth for 73k. 40k is worthy for this phone.

"
"

  The phone is best in all aspects except its charging speed.Every new flagship phone supports fast charging. But this phone really takes 1 hr  50 mins to charge when we are not using the phone.  Whereas while using the phone it takes 2hr 30 mins to charge. All the other features of this phone are awesome.Super Amoled Display is awesome.Camera is awesome.Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor works really well even if your hands are wet.Face Unlock has been degraded  due to punch hole display. But punch hole display really looks beautiful.Battery Capacity is very nice.  And  battery drain at night is about 2 percent which is very minimum .You must go for this flagship premium

"
"

  I would say just blindly close your eyes and order this amazing smartphone, been using it for days now and there is no issues at all. Works smooth and has the best camera that any smartphone can have! Value for money and it’s samsung! Amazing battery life, amazing camera, amazing screen and amazing Dolby speakers and more. Just go for it.

  This is the first time I am writing a review for a phone so I have no idea how to structure it. So let's see!1. Display:-One of the best displays you can get in the form factor of such small footprint. The stunning AMOLED display is so colour accurate that it can reproduce upwards of 50 million colours. The blacks are extremely dark and the pixels actually switch themselves off to save power and give a more detailed picture.10/102. Battery Life:-I got an unbelievable 9.5 hours of screen on time (screenshot provided) It has intelligent battery analysing software which involves AI to deliver optimum battery life.8.5/103. Performance:-The performance of this device is unmatched especially of you are getting the ceramic 512GB variant having the Exypnos Processor which is not as good as the Snapdragon processor but it is good enough to not notice the difference.8/104. Software:-The new One UI which comes with the all the bells and whistles of the Android 9 Pie. The security that Samsung Knox is offering is some next level security and the security offeed by Samsung Pass and Samsung Pay is very secure.7.5/105. Biometrics and Security:-The biometrics offered is futuristic and the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is something out of a Bond movie. The face unlock is pretty much useless as it is prove to be fooled by even a picture of your face.9/10 for the fingerprint scannerAnd6/10 for the face unlock6. Camera:-The camera is phenomenal. Look at the attached picture I took from my vacation. It looks so bright, properly exposed and even the colour accuracy is not that off. The dual aperture is great for night shots and the wide angle camera allows a lot of flexibility for taking good pictures.9.5/107. Final Verdict:-One of the best phones you can buy which out-performs a lot of phones in the market. It is well balanced and very nicely built. Quite light and durable if I might add.9/10 overall. Would highly recommend.

  Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus still the Best Flagship Smartphone To Buy in 2019If you're planning to buy Galaxy Note10 or OnePlus 7 ProThen plz look into Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus specifically for it's superior CameraIt's still a Better Buy1. Best Smartphone Display2. IP rating3. Wireless charging & Wireless powershare4. Still the Best Battery Backup on a Flagship Smartphone5. Superior True Flagship camera with amazing #wideangle camera & #supersteady video

  Was looking for a premium device which would not burn holes in my pocket.Best features-Display, UI, Build quality, Camera, Heart Rate sensor.Can Improve -Battery, gestures, front cameraSummary -A very good choice within 50k, it’s a perfect mix of premium build quality, power, optics, display and UI.Given as of 2020, this device is powerful enough to last for 2-3 years easily before it becomes backdated for the average user.

"
"

  Yes. This time Samsung got it right. Great work specially by people behind its software and camera. I think they have done lot of home work. Now Note 10 plus is real computer- what it was meant to be. Great cooridination from Samsung, Microsoft and Google has brought a Masterpiece in Tech world. Its software is as smooth as apple iOS, never hangs

"
"

  S10 plus is a complete package of modern techs. U name it u have it. From waterproof to wireless charging to our loved headphone jack.. It has everything..Battery : 9/ 10  packed with 4k mah battery can drive u a day full.Display : 10/10 Samsung leads in this section since years. Let's find a competor for this.Software : One UI has been developed on lessons learnt. Many root options are available out of the box.Camera : 10/10 will be posting some pics. Haters says it's photoshopd JK 😉Overall I have a power packed device in my hand. This review is after a month of use.

  I purchased it from reliance digital on 22 June 2019. On 22 july 2019 the phone got busted, correctly after the one month of purchase. 3 times moisture detected error popped out then on 4th time it never used to get charged and I have not dropped a single drop of water to this phone. Later I enquired the reliance digital they told ""we cannot help you since 14 days have passed"" then i moved to nearest samsung service centre in puttur karnataka, adithya communications authorized samsung service centre, they told ""we dont have the proper equipment to repair the phone"" and this is my story.Next, consumer court is the only place where my voices are heard.

  pre-order phone s10+ and also got  new samsung buds to offer on Rs.2999, it's an amazing upgrade for the previous s9+, not only display and performance but also good camera  quality and battery, appreciate what  Samsung did this product for early 2019.

  I got it yesterday , UI Is Not good , As It lags and gets heated After Playing continuous Pubg for 3 hrs ,In short Huawei p30 pro is far better than Samsung

"
"

  Writing this review after using the phone for 1 month. I did not buy phone from Amazon but writing a review here. The looks of the phone are amazing and processor is super fast. Screen resolution is fantastic. Sound is loud. Camera quality is very good. Did not have any problem from the time I'am using it. Earphone sound quality is very bad. The quality of the earphones provided with the phone is not of a premium phone.

"
"

  The mobile is fine but the pre book orders are not..I followed up with Amazon and samsung for the prebook and never got a positive response. Pathetic

"
"

  My dream phone.. someday I will buy this phone when my financials support me

"
"

  Poor camera quality. Switched from iPhone 10s max to Samsung 10s plus. Thre can be no comparison between these two as iPhone always have edge. Disappointed Samsung. Very very poor camera quality.

"
"

  The phone's battery life sucks...i have charge the phone twice in a day.....the fingerprint reader along with other sensors that allows the phone to use gestures doesn't work....the phone gets over heated....slows down and hangs a lot....and fast charging is just for the sake it takes me around 1hr 45mins to charge the phone minimum.....a one plus is a better phone than this....spending Rs. 73000 is just a waste and nothing else.....i would not recommend it anyone.....think twice before buying....infact the headphone quality isn't also good....they give a cheap earphones.....

"
"

  Whatever it is Samsung is famous in having software glitch. Thank you Samsung keep it up.By the way nice phone design.

  I like the feature wireless power share,Good quality camera and I like the finger security total I like this phone for buyNice screen and good sound qualityMore storage, and battery life is goodI like the phone very much front and backCamera very good quality ,I give full ratingFor this phone

  Make sure u take the phones price point to such an extent that the bank would call and ask that, do u want a phone loan, instead of home or car😂

"
"

  The best about this phone is display and the design..When you see this phone's display, you are gonna see a much difference in terms of quality and colors... It's way Way Much better than my XS..I just Love it using in my hands..Samsung.. You really did a great job This year...

"
"

  What to say?Its so cool. The finger print reader and face id acts as if it's known your face and finger forever.Its so responsive to touched and really high tech.It got five options for lock

  Liked it such a good phone nice Cam nice storage good stuff cool phone I've ever seen liked it gud

  UPDATE: Worst fingerprint reader ever ! Wish it had the optical scanner rather than this Shty ultrasonic. Takes a lot of effort to unlock the device and most of the time it says to press harder. Other than that you will have to moist yout finger everytime before unlocking if you have dry hands because ultrasonic scanner doesn’t detect dry skin.it has a gorgeous display and this time the front camera is great as compared to previous samsung phones. I used iphone X before but this phone looks way beautiful as compared to apple. The best of all its ‘manufactured in India ‘.. we even get a case in the box .

  I used an S9+ for 14 months (I bought it the day it launched in India) and switched to the s10+.I feel virtually no difference or enhancement using the s10+.In fact I feel the under screen finger print scanner is a pain to use when compared to the s9+'s rear scanner.The power button on the s9+ was much lower when compared to the s10+ and was easier to use.So if you are looking to buy the s10+ and have not used/owned the s9 series before, then please take my word, save  20k+ and buy the s9+ instead. S9+ will continue to get the latest android OS upgrades for next couple of years. So no worries on the software front as well.

  Everything great except for above average battery life.Was using an iPhone 11 before this and finally wanted to jump back to Android. With lot of new options in market,  I went with this due to price cut(51k).Pros1. Form factor ~Its a bliss to have such a big screen and a very thin form factor. Only 175 gms against ~200gm phone like oneplus 8pro. Great for everyday usage.2. Great display.  It's a standard 60hz display but it's one of the best displays in terms of resolution.3. Great,  versatile camera setup. I don't lose anything coming from iPhone 11. Night mode is pretty good as well.4. I was using s6 few years back. OneUI is far better than TouchWiz.5. 3 years major sw update promise from samsung for s10 series which means you should get android 12 at least.6. Several utilities like HR sensor and SPo2.7. One of the few phones which has 3.5 mm jack.8. No heating issues so far. Was about to buy S20 but there were reviews about battery heating.Cons1. Above average battery life. For a medium heavy user  you will have to charge one in the evening. You should get around 4-5 hours of screen on time.2. We only get exynos  in India and not snapdragon 855 but at least in s10 series there is not much difference other than battery life.Finally if you are ok with  above average battery life GO FOR IT!!! You can't find a 6.4 inches phone so slim and it's an all rounder. Attached couple of night mode photos taken at 8pm, one in normal and one with 2x zoom.

  Got the phone on Prime day . Bought the blue version. The build quality is top notch. Display is superb. This is one of the lightest 6.4 inch device at only 175 grams. Battery backup is decent and leaves me at around 35% by end of the day with no gaming. It comes with Android 10 and with assured updates till Android 12 as per recent communication from Samsung. The sound quality is also good . It has stereo speakers however we should not expect Quad DAC quality sound of LG Flagships. There is one flaw nevertheless. The device throws SD Card Read Write Error quite frequently just like the issues widespread in S9+ .  My Sandisk 128 GB SD card got corrupted by this device while it was working fine in my earlier devices S7, V30+ and my laptop. The service Engineer sent by Amazon to troubleshoot the issue could not rectify the issue. So Amazon has issued a replacement .The replacement S10+ has given flawless performance in last 3 weeks. The battery life is good and the design is timeless. It will age well. Security updates are pushed on monthly basis within the first week. The headphone jack is at bottom which is convenient as compared to my previous V30+ where the jack was surprisingly on top. The under display fingerprint scanner performs adequately. Samsung Pay and Knox security wraps off the remaining features. All in all a very elegant flagship phone from Samsung which is relevant in 2020. I have no objections in heartily recommending this phone to all those looking for a flagship phone at affordable price.

  Hi Everyone,So I am using this phone for last 10 days at the time of writing this review and I am in a position to write a detailed review.So Samsung s10+ looks stunning without a doubt and is packed with the latest Samsung in-house Exynos 9820 octa-core processor with 8GB of ram which makes multitasking buttery smooth and now it can keep more apps in memory without refreshing (High-end games) them as it used to be in predecessors Samsung Flagship phones.Let's bifurcate this review and discuss every segment.1. Display - Just one word wow! The display is superb as always it is with Samsung flagships phones and they have maintained their legacy in S10 series also.The punch hole camera looks great and undoubtedly better than weird notches but still, it can distract you but if you are creative you can use it in a better way, check out the walle wallpaper in Images attached.2. Camera- The second important think about the phone is the camera. So it is packed with the triple camera set up at the back and dual camera setup at the front. So total 5 cameras are present on s10 plus (highest in s10 series ignoring the 5G version).The images are crisp from the main camera and I love the wide angle camera which captures 123-degree field of view, so now you can put more in the frame without moving an inch.I am not a great fan of the telephoto lens but it comes handy when you want to take close up short want to record videos.Although it has two front cameras but the depth-sensing camera is not of any great use at least of now as you can get the same shorts from s10 which has only 1 camera.The Front camera takes good images not great as it pre-apply filters and makes the skin tone brighter and washed out and bokeh mode or portrait mode is not that great. I think it can be solved using software update.It comes with different focus mode and I love colour point and spin mode the most, attached the image for the same and you will find the colour point in action in flower pic.It can record 4k at 60 frames per second which is great and also super slo-mo videos at 960 frames for 0.4 seconds though in 720p but is great.It needs a little bit improvement in front camera otherwise back cameras are great.3. Battery - I am really happy that they have placed a massive battery of 4100 mAh which can provide you at least full day of juice.The charging time through charger supplied with the box is around 100 minutes from 0 to 100% and also the reverse wireless charging works great and I am using my s10 plus to charge my s8 plus.4. Biometrics- The ultrasonic fingerprint is really fast and works even when your hands are wet. You can unlock your phone even when the screen is turned off. Although you need to build memory muscle to ensure that you are putting your finger or thumb at the right place.The Face recognition is also fast but not as secure as fingerprint and also I hate swipe up the lock screen similar to iPhone X.5.  UI and overall experience - The S10 plus comes with android pie topped with one UI out of the box which is cherry on the top. The One UI is designed for single hand user and I love the night mode so they have worked hard for this One UI, which can be seen also.So overall great phone and highly recommended if you can afford it.Also, the pre offers are coming out so if you have pre-booked the phone get your earbuds at 2,999 rupees only through registering on Samsung shop.

  I am big fan of apple and never used any android device but when i saw S9 picture quality i decided to buy the next model and as soon as S10 launched i booked it. I like the phone very much. Its nice phone.

"
"

  Only one word,  Power in hand

"
"

  Although its Sept 2020 and I was going to buy a s20+ , but comparing them technically there is hardly any difference apart from the camera.I have used a s9+ which has been amazing. S10+ also continues the same legacy. Well built, excellent quality, CPU is still better than most of its competitors , screen is amazing as always.

"
"

  the battery is poor . A flagship phone with a price tag of 73k the battery life is not good. it lasts for 1 day only . (2hours youtube ,1.5hrs calling , music about 2hrs . and no heavy games. I had to ecchange this phone once and still there is a very slight heating issue.Apart from this everthing is very very good. But you cant use any of those features because of battery

"

  I bought it on launch date 2019... I was using in chennai and hyderabad not facing any kind of network issue. I came to my home town after covid lovkdown. I'm staying 2km away from city.Now facing very bad network issues in s10+1 i change all network setting i can ""nothing happened""2 i changed sim 1 to sim 2 slot still no improvement...3 Initially I was using airtel i changed it fr other network for checking whether my sim problem.. still no improvement on network. Thy i realize that was my phone problem.I was compared my mobile with below:1 samsung s6 edge (i have 3 points in network but 0 network in s10+) highly disappointed2 samsung note 8 my brother mobile still same as my point 1.3 samsung m31s was purchased last month on launch. Same issue as per point 1 no network coverage in s10+4 I compared with lot of other drands too..Highly disappointed of spending 78k ... I was previously using s6 edge . I thought upgrade product but I totally failed on my personal thought...I'm a rider I used to around lot of placed whenever my network is down I thought I was in interior places.. but tat was not the real truth.. is problem.... lolI'm not telling all s10 had this issue.. hope only mine....No other options now...definitely ill return if I bought & tested in hometown. Ill keep this as my 1st priority fr nxt flagship purchase fr sure....

  This flagship Exynos variant is a good phone in general. If not for the battery life which is average at best (Screen on time only 4-5 hrs max and total time battery lasts is 18-20 hrs), I'd definitely recommend this phone.Also, the exynos version which is available worldwide except the US where the Snapdragon 855 is sold, is slower than the latter (as per some youtube videos i watched conparing them) and also the battery life is significantly different. Not very well done there samsung, i mean why wouldn't u compete with them in the same phone?!Cameras are a very long topic to discuss on but i can assure you that samsung has covered themselves well in that domain. Photos are vibrant and full of colors plus their wide angle cam is just amazing.OneUI is quite an intuitive and smart software which has a lot of features (Tasks edge is just brilliant along with some other cool features that you should check out from youtube videos) and i would give it a point over the oxygen OS of OP phones which also i loved. Oh btw I'm coming from the OP5 and thats why i complain of the battery life (which was quite awesome for a year for me) and it charged blazingly fast which this phone sadly doesnt (1.5 hrs from 10 to 100) and also it charged at the same rate no matter if you're using the phone or not which again the samsung lags behind in. The worst part is the standby time at night in which the s10+ loses 20-25% of battery which sucks for such a flagship phone.Big story short, while samsung has a great software, quite good cameras front and back and also the design and the brilliant display, all that should be complimented with a more than average battery life but we would just have to wait and see if a software update changes that or not.Update :1.5 yrs down the line I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with the phone even though I have to charge it twice in a day with my usage of 4-6 hrs screen time (WhatsApp, email, youtube, a bit of netflix, football scores app, few other apps, and all this in the battery saving mode.. I still wish I had the snapdragon version and it didn't heat up while charging. Other than that I'm very pleased with the oneUI software. Camera I believe the selfie cam is not upto the mark as it takes some pixelated pics. Rear cam is brilliant.

  I have used all the flagship android and apple phones so far and keep on buying new ones.Currently I am using iPhone Xs and Samsung S10+.Last galaxy phone I used was S7 edge and I replaced it with one plus 5t and it was a good replacement.I had complaint about Samsung phones for their bloatware that u can't uninstall and they keep on using resources in the background.They changed it and now the system has been changed for the good.Good battery lifeBest in class cameraAwesome screenFingerprint scanner and face detection still can't beat apple.I still believe that apple iPhone Xs camera is better.If u r gamer and movie lover then this phone is the best screen u can go for.

"
"

  I moved to this phone from an iPhone 7 and a One Plus 7.Can't ask for more. It does everything perfectly and it is such a beauty. The screen is gorgeous and the camera is so good.My last Samsung was a Note 2 and I moved to iPhone after that because of Samsung's UI, but One UI is such a great improvement. It's so much more affordable than the iPhone and so much better.

"
"

  So I'm using this phone since 2 months now. I'm in love with it. Super fast performance.. amazing speakers with Dolby music.. display is amazing.. finger print is a bit laggy sometimes as it is on display and does not respond properly when screen is glossy.. face recognition is superb..Over all it is worth a buy! I used to hate Samsung. But now seems that I've changed my thoughts!

"
"

  I've been using S10 Plus  for over a month and I'm very happy with its overall performance. The phone is really fast with all my work and personal usage. There is zero lag while moving between different applications. The battery backup is fantastic and there is no need to worry about charging even after 24 hours of continuous usage. The picture quality is probably the best among all its peers. Would highly recommend this device owing to high quality of components and its functional design.

"
"

  Face recognition cannot be fooled by photos or videos of a person, but it can be fooled with closed eyes. Ultrasonic fingerprint reader is super fast and unlocks immediately if my finger is dry. The display is crisp and works wow in sunlight. Everything about the phone just blew me away except the selfies. Maybe a software upgrade will make the selfies appear less washed out.

"
"

  Camera quality is too low.. Oneplus 6t is far better on comparing pic quality. And fingerprint reader works 6 out of 10 times. Battery is ok so far. Disappointed by Samsung's camera quality :( if possible i want refund

"
"

  I upgraded from lgv30+ to Samsung s10plus  .firstly very impressive design and love with the super Amoled  screen, great battery life last whole day .It was a surprise when my friends iPhone x had nil battery and I shared via wireless powershare..will definitely recommend

  Good Phone

"

  I won't buy this if it's not a snapdragon processor - if they are selling their phones with snapdragon in USA why not in India ?? As we pay more than any for the same phones.. this is one stupid move to not have snapdry processor in India - if their processor is good why don't they release the same phones to usa 😡 - snapdragon is way better than their own processor

"
"

  Super smart phone..Thanks samsung and amazon..

"
"

  No new innovation vs earlier models

  excellent moble

  Have been using this phone from a month now.Bought it from a local store for 65000 rs.Now the pros and consPros First :1. Display - As always the display is best compared to any smartphone. Samsung is a king in oled displays.2. Software - Samsung One UI has lot of useful features which are not available on stock android phones.3. Camera- These are one of the best cameras currently in any smartphone.Now the Cons and the reason for 1* Rating.1. Processor- Exynos 9820 is not even a little close to performance in comparison to SD 855.Games like Pubg lag on this phone.2. Heating- the phone heats up a lot during gaming. In 5 minutes you can make omelette on this thing.3. Slow charging - Samsung has not updated the charging speed since 2014!4. Battery life - poor battery life. This is again due to the cheap Exynos processor.5. Punch hole camera. You feel their presence everytime and it is annoying. A bezel would have been better.6. Price- if you can spend 73000 on a phone then Oneplus 7 Pro offers a lot of things better than S10+Verdict-Ignore the Indian Version and try to get an Imported version if you like Samsung phones.It is not worth paying so much for Exynos.

  Received the phone on very first day had done pre booking  and had sold my one plus 6t that was my biggest mistake the phone is class of piece no doubt  in camer only if company  says it has 4100 mah battery i do not trust  i get the feel of 3400 mah battery  on the phone and have charge my phone  twice and company is giving that old charger claiming it as a fast charger which  takes 1.45 minutes  to charge  a phone i am not comparing the phone with onle plus fast charger in some much of innovation of good phone company doesn't looks to go for more quick charging  and there just a change of a camera in the phone and 8 gb ram phone in which Samsung personal apps only occupy 4gb ram o find the phone very expensive and same old gadget as 8 plus only giving a smart watch or era plugs on a cheap price i think  it not preferable to buy this phone at this price

"
"

  I would have loved this phone if they had shipped with Snapdragon processor as Snapdragon is the most advanced mobile processors.I hope someone is reading this and there are many more like me.

"
"

  Why to buy android with such price - Samsung galaxy phones will reduce price by 1/3 in few months and resell value is like Chinese phone. Phone will be unusable within 1 year with poor or no software update. Think before buy

"
"

  I ordered S10 plus from Samsung website and got the delivery with in 3 days. As I've prebooked it, I brought Galaxy Buds with the offer (As the Galaxy Watch has only only one color so chosen Buds).Coming to features:Face lock is pretty awesome. Unlocks within a second.But found a bit problem with the fingerprint lock. Need to press a little harder on the screen for little longer around 2-3 seconds.Camera is good. Though the beauty option is off, it still not shows exactly how we are (still adds little beauty to it).Object images are damn. I took a picture and it's like HDR picture downloaded from internet. LOL... Camera resolution and pixel density is awesome... It took almost 50MB for a picture.Battery is not up to mark. But we have medium and max power saver option. Thanks for them. My phone was still working in the same way when the battery was 1%. No lagging or anything.Performance and every other are nice. But heating a bit faster when you play high end games like injustice2 within an hour or two.AR emoji sucks. But it's GIFs are OK.Always on Display (AOD) is another thing to mention. It has hell number of options to choose. And I love it...Worth for every penny.

"
"

  Coming from a pixel i really missed certain features when i upgraded to this the led notification light, the simple and smart camera the clean ui and its the only device which will support navigational gestures even for third party launchers(heavily missed) for me. the pros are better display and wireless charging if its your thing!

"
"

  Was using oneplus 5t before this.. it has been a day and I am finding difficult to start writing pros about the phone.. so let me start with cons-1. Battery sucks big time.. charging very slow, drainage too fast2. This shouldn't have been on top but keyboard language options are missing (don't know if these are available deep inside)3. Screen cast is not an option on top grid if you use google home/cast screen4. Fingerprint reader is disappointingKInd of pros- camera better than Oneplus 5t but otherwise not that great to spend 74k.. see I didn't even gave 6T a chance, forget 7pro.....touch is smooth... you get headphones wired ones :-/Signoff statement- Phone is overhyped

"

  I moved over from a 4-year-old iPhone to the S10+. I have been using this phone for about 3 weeks now and what I am stating here might as well be initial impressions. I may update this review based on the performance and any issues I come across moving forward. Also, I would like to state in advance that I am a single SIM user and any review points below with regards to performance are based on single SIM usage. Also, apologies in advance for this lengthy review.Why I picked the S10+?I figured it was time for me to switch since my phone was getting old. When I looked at what Apple had to offer, nothing impressed me other than the stability that iOS offers. But this time I was looking for more features and innovation. iPhone designs and features have remained pretty much the same for the last 3 years with minimal increments. Then I turned towards Android. Whenever I buy a new phone, I intend to use for the next 3 years at least. Following on from that, it is always best (for me) to invest in a good flagship device that I can hold on to for the coming years. After all, a smartphone is literally the most personal device anyone can own. Did not like the ‘mechanical’ pop up cam in One Plus 7 pro. I do not prefer Chinese phone brands as well (no offense, but they are just not my game). So, I looked at what Samsung had to offer and S10+ got my attention. I was hesitant to order this online because I wanted to first feel the device and look at it physically. When I went to the store, I loved it immediately and they offered it to me at a price I could not refuse. So, I purchased it.Model – Prism White 128 GB with 8GB RAM.Without getting into technical specs, I am going to list down the pros and cons of this phone quickly:Pros:1. Design is a major hit. I mean just a glance and I fell in love with it. While everyone else copied Apple with the notch, Samsung went a different way and did something entirely different. Kudos to Samsung for not getting into the notch game and totally coming up with a new design. Now, that is innovation! The build quality is premium.2. Display is top class. You cannot go wrong. I like how the colours pop and how bright the screen can get. It is a major step-up for me coming from a phone that is of the same size but a smaller display. So, totally loving it.3. Samsung One UI is polished and snappy on top of Android Pie. Android has come a long way from what it used to be 5 years ago, and now I am really appreciating what it can be. My last Samsung was the S3, which eventually had me frustrated and move to iOS. But I love all the features and performance along with customization that can be done these days.4. Performance is really good. No app crashes yet and it does what I need it to do and when I need it done.5. Cameras (both front and back) are another major step-up for me. I have not yet explored everything here. But just the way everything works once I open it makes me happy. I can just take it out and start clicking.6. Comes with a good transparent plastic case and screen guard applied on the screen, out-of-the box. Little add-ons like these are always appreciated by the average consumers. The phone is looking good with the case on it and I have not seen many smudges or any scratches. I think I will continue to use it till I would need a different case, since it serves my purpose.7. Sound quality via earphones is good after turning on Dolby Atmos. Although, I wish it was a little more balanced and smooth. Without earphones, sound from the in-built speakers is also good and loud. No complaints there.8. No connectivity issues here, be it Wi-Fi, Cellular or Bluetooth. Making connections is snappy and intuitive without hassles.9. Loving the Samsung Pay feature. Many a times I just step out without my wallet and end up paying for my purchases using this feature on my phone. Again, loving it!10. Headphone jack is a big win here. This is probably the last generation of Samsung flagship phone that will sport the headphone jack. If that is important to you, grab this one without a second thought.11.  Camera features and picture quality - excellent.12. Bixby is useful, if you set it up correctly and see yourself using its features. I am not sure why it is getting so much hate. It may not be as advanced as the Google assistant, which I use as well, but it is good at some basic things. I use it to run routines mostly, it is a very nice feature.Cons:1. Battery life! Now, since I moved over from iOS, I really don’t know what to make of the battery life. I just think it is OK (not good) since the device comes with 4100mah battery and I get only around 5.5 hours of screen time. I also did some online research and some forums have blamed it on the Exynos processor and the way it handles network reception and power consumption. It could also be because of the display. I have set it at WQHD+.My daily routine of using the phone involves using carpooling app to and from work (~2 hours), about 3-4 hours of music to focus at work, about 30-45 minutes of video during lunch time, about 2 hours of calls, some texting, about 30 minutes on Instagram and watching an hour or two of Netflix at night. I do fiddle around a little every day trying to customize things on display. I also run a night time routine on Bixby where it disables all network features and location for few hours at night daily. Also, the battery drains considerably on stand-by. I lost 2-3% battery every hour. I keep AOD on to show on screen-tap.I am able to get through my work day just fine, but I feel the need to top up the charge at about 8 pm in the night, else, there will not be sufficient juice left for my Netflix session. Most phones with battery >= 4000mah last for 1-1.5 days these days.2. Fingerprint reader is annoying sometimes, could have been better. Unless you press on that sweet spot on the screen, you will need to give it a few tries. If you get used to it, it works quite fast actually. They could have made the face unlock more secure.3. The phone is made of glass with aluminium frame on the outside and needs to be handled delicately, preferably with a case.4. Though the phone is really fast and snappy 99% of the time, about 1% of the time there are lags and stutters. That is not acceptable for me from a flagship device. Transitions, animations and scrolling can be smoother, if you ask me.5. Heat issues – The phone gets warm when charging and also with moderate use of camera. I do not know why, but otherwise, most of the time, it remains cool.6. Charging gets slow when using the device, which does not make sense to me.I do not use my phone for gaming. So, cannot comment on gaming performance. All said and done, this phone is a good buy if you are looking for things mentioned in Pros, can live with the Cons and if you are planning to stick to it for the next 2+ years. It is a hard sell at the price of 73K, considering how soon its value goes down for resale. It is advisable to grab it during sale days or when it is on offer for something less than 60K.

  I am a Onpleus user for a quite long time was desperately waiting for 7 Pro but the weight and form factor of it was no go for me(that's my opinion doesn't mean it's a bad device).However coming to S10 plus, the eye candy feature is its screen. Without saying it's best in the 2019 market yet. Camera does pretty good job both in day and night lightning conditions. I don't play games but my usage is pretty heavy per day and with that I get easily a day and half. If you are having small hands better to go for S10 than. Samsung TouchWiz earlier was no go for me but Samsung has worked pretty hard on OneUI. However it comes with lots of apps pre installed from Samsung, some of them are like bloatware.But overall it's a fab device and great job done by Samsung this year.

"

  I am using this device since a week. Its top notch in all aspect. Nothing to complain about. Its standard company. OnePlus and Redmi is good for people who have lower budget but If you have enough to spend go with Samsung s10 plus. Believe me you will not be disappointed. Screen is buttery smooth as Samsung is master in OLED panel and other devices like oneplus using Samsung's OLED panel. Camera produce very vibrant pictures with high quality photos. Battery back is decent. Charge quickly. What else you want ?? Ultra sonic fingure print senser is too good. water resistant phone. Nothing to regrate about. Feels very premium in hand. Selfie camera is deadly amazing. I am happy to have this s10 plus. God bless all. Thank you.

  I bought it ( samsung s10 plus white color ) from hissar ( haryana ) at 65000/- ( 6000/- cashback ). I sold my samsung s9 plus mobile for s10 plus. Now I am very happy to purchase it. I liked it very much. There are many new features in it. Most of I  like ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on front of screen ,  its light weight & its lovely design.

  The Note and S series are good devices and I am willing to buy one. But until and unless Samsung brings Snapdragon powered devices here I won't!

"

  They're selling Exynos version in the same price range as Snapdragon version from US. Samsung is fooling indian people.
