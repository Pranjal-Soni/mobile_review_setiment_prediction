  A well designed phone

  One of best in this price range.It's beyond my expectations for gaming and mobile photography.I have also added 4 pictures for reference. N 3 pictures are clicked from same angle but with 3 different cameras of this ph.

  Shifting Samsung to one plus. ... Awesome experience ...Best phone now available in market ....Speed..4g experience in 5g phone best....Mind blowing ....

  Writing after month of use and experiment with camera. This is Not great compared to previous versions of one Plus, camera quality is very bad and photos looks burry and artificial. Especially low light photos are very bad, if you click a moon it will Look like a sunny sky, light enhancement and intelligent image processing has gone wrong. Otherwise its similar to older version of one plus and waste buying this if you already have a one plus. Infact I had one plus 6 which was much more better than this in terms of camera, I was comparing the images of one plus 6 saved to google which has much lesser resolution, one plus 6 pics looked great and near to reality where are 48 MP one plus 8 images looked blurry and full of senseless light and colour. Regretting have sold one plus 6 in a exchange offer.

  Awsome phone....Pros-Performance,chargeing speed,Battery life, oxygen OSCons-poor cam quality

"

  They kinda SETTLED with this one.1. You pay 50G for this hyped up device and chances are you will get a pre-applied screen protector with bubbles on it. Spend 50 grands worth to see bubbles on your screen?2. OnePlus 3T had a better camera than this, in my opinion. I'm not going by specs here. It's about how the rendered images look and feel. Some images are washedout as indicated on many online reviews and if you feel like zooming in on your shots, you will regret clicking that picture in the first place. OnePlus messed up by a big margin as compared to the iPhones and the Samsung's.3. They give you a silicon case along with the device which turns yellow within 15 days of normal use. Cheap show, OnePlus!Some pros: fast charging, great display (god I can't stand that iPhone notch that looks like a stupid haircut lol), good design, & fingerprint reader.Oh and their customer service is not as fancy as their marketing team. So careful with that too.OnePlus, Never Again!

  The product is not at all good. It's not value for money either. The build quality is good however the performance is not good. The phone lags and has several bugs. It hangs while switching between apps. The ringer, Bluetooth and wifi has performance issues and turns on off or disconnects automatically. Other than that, the phone automatically restarts. The VoLTE functions badly too. I'm not at all satisfied with the product. I would not recommend this phone to anyone. I'm stuck now. But it's better to go for other devices.

"
"

  With same configuration variants available with Nord by OnePlus. Why go for OnePlus 8 which is almost more than 20000 costly than Nord.I don't know whats the mindset of OnePlus behind launching of Nord with same configuration as OnePlus 8 and almost at half-price.Hence I will give only single star in value for money. Oneplus 8 Product is good but costly.

  I am using 12Gb Ram version of Oneplus 8, performance is just seamless, high end games like Call of duty, Pubg Mobile, Asphalt 9 runs very smoothly.The camera quality has improved from previous Oneplus series and so alo it feels light to hold and even after curved screen the phone is very handyThe first thing anyone will like about the OnePlus 8 is the 90Hz Fluid Display which is really smooth. The dynamic wallpapers are a good showcase of the prowess of the display and you notice how the screen literally comes to life every time you switch on the phone. Also, it was hard to miss the fact that this phone offers one of the deepest blacks I have experiences in recent times.Pros:Excellent displayPerfect SizeLight Weight - 175gmsVery good battery lifePowerful processorGood low-light photos5G ReadyCons:No optical zoomMiddling photos overallBlack Color looks absolutely stunning !!!!!!Best Smartphone in India Under 50kCheck out the photos I Have shared !!!!

  I'm writing this review after using it for 2 months, Camera is very much average ,not a flagship at this price ,display is good not excellent,bettery life is good, touch is not responding sometimes.Coming to the performance it's hard to believe that it's 12gb varient it hangs a lot .Very much disappointed with thisNot recommended at all .else you'll regret .Instead buy iphone at this price point

"
"

  A well built phoneScreen: Good 90hz screen with minimal bezels, one downside is a greenish tint when viewed from an angle. Also due to the curved edges there will be a lot of accidental touches.Camera: Appart from the 2MP macro camera both ultra wide and main camera are very good. Although there is colour difference in all the cameras the overall experiance is good.Battery life: Give decent battery life with 90hz on gives an average of 5-6 hrs of screen on time. One down side is the high battery consumption during idle. Also about the warp charger: it is impressive and very fast but as soon as you plug it in your phone temperature shoots up really fast. So if you are using a case it would be wise to remove it while charging. This can increase heat desipation and increase battery life.Value for money: Overall it's a good buy especially with the offers from HDFC and SBI cards you could get a better deal.

  I got it delivered today.. 26th May and it is worth buying.It made my day in lockdown.Thank you Amazon!!! :*

  It's been a liitle over than 3 months since I received my OnePlus 8 phone ( 12GB | 256GB ).Pros - Superb styling, great display, ultra fast processing speed (you can play heavy games with no lag), very responsive fingerprint scanner, full charge within 1 hour.Cons - Battery life not very good (full charge lasts hardly a day with minimal use), mediocre camera, transparent back cover that comes with phone is poor quality (my cover has turned yellowish within 3 months).OnePlus killed its own flagship by bringing OnePlus Nord with almost same specs but 20k cheaper. I am loving my OnePlus 8 but feeling betrayed by OnePlus. Hence the low rating.Do NOT shell out 50k for OnePlus 8; go for OnePlus Nord and save 20k.

"
"

  Amazing product with edge to edge display with 30W warp charging

"
"

   Writing this review after 3 months of usage.I kinda regret buying it after the serious performance degradation after 3 months of usage.Pros: Solid phone with a nice display, excellent for gaming with a decent battery backup.Cons:Camera: Pathetic. Zoom a pic and you'll regret everytime. Even with a 100% display brightness, you will find difficulty to see screen under bright light. Also if you use camera under sunlight for a while, it hangs! Yeah this 50k worth gadget stop responding to you if you use under bright sun! Also I am regularly facing display freeze issue. You'll get only a black blank screen when you unlock your phone (check video)Over-all, I am disappointed with my first oneplus experience.Final rating 2/5

"
"

  Pros- •Battery life  •Performance  •UiCons- •Camera could be better  •Should have been water proof as in US carriers it is certified.Overall I am a big fan of OnePlus and I love this phone.

"
"

  So it's been more than two weeks using the device. I must say this is a pretty amazing device.So you all must have gone through tons of YouTube unboxing videos before buying so I won't be repeating the same things.To keep it short let's go via areas1. Camera - it's good if you are a normal person who doesn't keep on clicking each and every thing. If you are among those insta King/Queen who click before eating also then not so good. It's one plus not iphone. Overall it's not a bad it's good, and maybe few tweeks would get fixed with new updates.Battery : I am not a big fan of its battery life, I mean it's decent compared to the 6.55' screen it's really decent. It will easily last a day with normal usage. It's not a superb battery which will go on and on it's quite decent. The battery life drains really fast when you are playing PubG. One can drain the entire battery by playing 4-5 hours continuously. But this downside is easily overcome by the super 30W warp charge. I means it's insanely fast. In 30 mins you can get around 60-70% charge.3. Screen/Display (whatever you call): So the 6.55' Fluid Amoled display is really good. The colours seem more vibrant and pleasant to eyes. The Amoled screen is really good the black detailing is amazing. The online viewing experience is awesome. I have only one issue with Netflix and Amazon prime is that I cannot switch to fill screen mode as I am able to see in YouTube. For This issue I am still searching for an answer. The best part is when you want to read a book on Kindle or save battery or go easy on eyes switch to black & white mode and get all mono effect.4. Touch capacitive: The user experience in touch is pretty amazing you can say close to what you get in I phone. The 90hz refresh rate do bring the best out of the phone. Once you start using the phone you touch will become like feather light. No need to apply high pressure with a small touch the work is done. Scrolling insta feeds or twitter is like gliding your fingers.

  OnePlus was meant to be a budget phone.. However 50k for 12GB ram & 256Gb space is a decer buy.. audio is good.. Pictures are quite decent, you'll just need to get to know how to setup proper camera settings.. Screen resolution is epic.. warp charging is super quick.. If you expect to use a phone for a couple of years without any issues then this is your best buy..

"
"

  It had not been a month and already facing problem in one plus, the device is restarting automatically on a continuous basis. Tried every possible mean like clearing data, formatting the phone, but no luck, now i regret buying this phone as it would have been better to purchase some other cell phone. Have previously used one plus and that cell was much better. Sorry to say but your quality is degrading. Never expected that this phone will face such issue at an early stage

"
"

  The oneplus Phone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 2pm on 17th june, I got my phone before the delivery date.but the phone box was damagedThe overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast.VALUE FOR MONEY!!!!!!!!!

"
"

  Fast but not too fast 20% faster than my Oneplus 5t  yes screen experience is good it premium other good features are there only concern is pricing it took from flagship killer to flagship with flagship amount..what they are trying to say is if you need a phone like this you have to dig down deep in your pocket to get it.I will not suggest oneplus 6 or 7 people should jump on oneplus 8 this is more aur less same thing.

"
"

  The product came in great shape and well packed. The screen size is large, all featured are great and battery life is superb. Comes with a super fast charger so charges really quick and last very long. Camera quality is actually great.

"
"

  Fantastic device, very fast and efficient. Design is superb. Worth spending the cost of the device. Delivery by Amazon was as fantastic as always. Upto the mark. Battery capacity is good for a day support. Supper clear picture. Ultra white display adds pleasure to working with this device.

"
"

  Not worth...1. Battery drains out within a day after very nominal usage of phone calls only.2. Better pay extra 20K to buy samsung or apple.3. Camera quality sucks.We are getting good on paper listed hardware but outcome of that hardware is not worth paying this much amount.

"
"

  Nice device.Average display.Not quite colour accurate.Battery is good.Sound is okayish.Photos and videos average.Rest all is fine.

"
"

  Display is Amazing im terms of touch and image and videol clarity, quite great graphics while playing games like PUBG and Call of duty mobile.Not very happy with rear camera, but overall great phone

"
"

  I think this phone is slightly overpriced. Camera quality is pretty much below average for this price range. Low light photos are pathetic and blurry. If you love to take photos then this phone will dispoint you for sure.Battery life is also not so impressive. 30w charger charges phone quickly but phone heats up during the charging.Screen quality is good and 90hz refresh rate works flawlessly. Some gestures provided by Oxygen OS are really cool.Only reason you can consider this phone is for Oxygen OS :) and if that is the reason then better go for Nord and not for this one.

"
"

  Was expecting a lot from one of the Most Anticipated Launch of the Year. 5G is just a word shared to lure. The system hangs and Alexa Compatibility Stops on its own. No more fancying the product. Other Brands are equally catching up. I own a 12GB 256GB Version of OnePlus 8. One can consider other Brands as well.

"
"

  I received my order day before it's Arrival. Superb display and Smooth touch .Overall loving this phone .Good performance

"
"

  Battery life is ok ok, but not worth buying. Got phone yesterday and i am having issue like heating while charging and lag at 90 hz in 12 gb variant.oneplus you disappointed me this time.

"
"

  Camera was not so satisfying.

"
"

  Very fast and smooth interface. Camera 4/5, Brilliant Gaming experience! Wonderful display, great battery life and charging speed. Meets all expectations, Highly recommended!

"
"

  As per price value for money, but not a comparison with samsung galaxy s series. Company compare with s 20 but actual competition with s 10. Hang problem in few app. Heavy weight compare to samsung s series. Thikness also more.Display also cut by round corner.Screen shot Photos share in feedback . Screenshot are full but in actual display corners are cut so difficult to use.Bettery back also not as per expected.

"

  This the Detailled review of Oneplus 8..After a month of usePros1 Super Fast2 Fast fingerprint sensor3 5G4 Oxygen OS5 Display6 BatteryCons1 Not Good Camera2 Not a Flagship killerConclusionIf you dont care of camera and want 5g go for it.Better buy OP 8 Pro

"
"

  Gaming - All high end games runs very smoothly without any lag.Multi tasking - with the 865 processor and 12gb memory, the phone is awesome to work.Camera - not up to the grade. If u are looking for a good camera phone with best quality shots please don't buy this phone.

"
"

  I got the phone today I started doing initial instructed setup and phone is over heating already

"
"

  Excellent Design and Look. Bettery life is very good and absolutely is a product of Value for Money. Intelligent Solution. This is the 2nd One Plus Phone I have. Very very sleek model and stylish. Amazing speed and easy to manuvour.

"
"

  Battery life purely depends how you use it. As far as my usage it's has good backup. Camera features are simply of of world. In the picture attached it's taken without using zoom option still so clear. Shot from 22nd floor.

"
"

  This phone is really a damn good one.Gaming in this beast Is really awesome.....Camera features are really good which gives a clear and live pictures .........Phone is working in the lightning speed .......it's worth  of the amount ..........A smartphone with completely new features.Specially the Dolby atoms sound system which is part of this, really good smart phone ......If you are of OnePlus users and thinking of to buy or replace your mobile ....then  this 8  version is the best you would get........Quiet easy to handle ........Good battery backup ...of longlifeWhat more you need in a smartphone😀✌️✌️✌️

"
"

  Phone touch not responsive sometimes .Heating issue faced. Camera quality is same as 15K phone not a flagship phone.This review is after using phone for 20 days. I still own oneplus 3, which sometimes feels better than this oneplus 8

"
"

  I previously owned OnePlus 5. It's fingerprint sensor was much better than the OnePlus 8. Fingerprint is pathetic in this device.Didn't have that premium feeling which I had while using OnePlus 5. OnePlus is going down in quality.Only good thing about this device is it takes very less time to charge device completely but there are other devices with cheaper price which have equally good charging speed.I'm one DISAPPOINTED ONEPLUS USER.I would not suggest anyone to buy this unless there are significant improvements made on the phone through software updates.

"
"

  OnePlus 8 Mobile Phone Experience is Amazing. Almost all the features are really new for me as first time using the Premium Model Mobile Phone..Almost not found any flaws in the features of this model but recently got stucked with the Screen Calibration option as wrongly selected as Advanced instead of selecting Vivid or Natural.. wrongly selected the option as Advanced, then the Screen colour had been changed and not found any option to make the Screen Calibration as Vivid or Natural.. Finally we tried to Reset my Mobile to Factory Reset.. After that only the Screen colour becomes normal like before..Good Mobile usage Experience getting from One Plus 8 model..

"
"

  Finger print sometime don't recognise,Apps with lock enabled get opened immediately after phone restart.Battery drians way faster than expected under 90HZSometimes corner touches don't respond to touches have to rotate phone and tap again to get those optionsInitial screen quality was good and smooth but after a month now not happy as it was beforeOne big problem is with network ,when your downloading something in background other apps gets very less internet bandwidth and hence buffers a lotYes it's get hot while heavy gaming especially at corners and side buttons

"
"

  After almost 1 and a half month I am reviewing this phone. It is really a beast with double battery life and a powerful processor with a huge display it is a little but costly but value for money.I dropped it from moving riskhaw but shockingly it survive with just a scratch on plactic scratch guard and working just like before.Camera is awesome low light picture are delightful.What you want from a phone with 12gb ram which runs games smooth then any other phone.Better in price then 8 Pro

"
"

  Worst phone don't buy network goes idle only data will work volte will disappear suddenly and have to restart phone to resume voice services Chinese handset makers cheating people by giving quality first and cheat in latest versions I have used 3 models in OnePlus but earlier models were good compared to OnePlus 8 very disappointed

"
"

  You will love this phone the second you grab this lovely and premium device in your hand. I was really soo confused which phone to buy. If you are having habit of using the best phone this device is made for you . Everything is perfect, I have used this device and it is the best choice one should make .Camera takes perfect shots.Battery life is soo good.Warp charging is just mind blowing. You will be surprised to see the speed of charging.Premium and handy device.

"
"

  I already own an OnePlus 7T Pro. This phone (OnePlus 8) I thought impress more than 7T Pro as I paid 30% more than what I paid for 7T. However I didn't like so much and felt I overpaid for this piece. May be there are more options if I pay a little more!

"
"

  Phone is slightly slimmer and taller than I would have liked but overall looks great especially since I switched over from an iPhone. Phone is quick & nimble but it did hang a couple of times already which I am not pleased about. Bonus points for shipping a phone with a screen guard and clear cover instead of going out to a shop to get it these. Camera isn't much of an improvement over the OnePlus 7 so buy the OnePlus 8 if you think you need more RAM and more storage.

"
"

  Mobile get heat while charging and watching video and also charging is also very slower than oppo F9 pro.

"
"

  Battery life is not good, phone shuts down within half day, lines are seen on the screen, performance not good.

"
"

  It's a good gadget and it's worth in this much money and I really got in love with my phone and it always get fully charged in 40 minutes and it's a mean thing for me.Love for one plusRegardsPawanpreet Singh

"
"

  Touch screen is not working after 15vdays of purchase.It is hard to set and find screen cover in the market.  Amazon showed a screen cover compatible with this phone but actually,  it is not suitable for this set.

"
"

  This phone is absolutely awesome with best features .Selfie cam is not upto a level . Speakers are absolutely marvellous...Loved it.....

"
"

  Not a value for money.. far below the expectations.. screen is not wide as required..Go for Samsung... always better

"
"

  Hi guys one plus 8 is falied versionSo don't buy that productsBattery performance is so worstDisplay is also not goodWaste of money

"
"

  Simply love it...i have always loved my gadgets and i gt the same from these lifeless friends..this phone has all the features for a student..for a hasle free and undistured/undistractable study with work mode and much more..value for money..

"
"

  DON'T BUY THIS PHONE .SCREEN TINT ISSUE.NOT ONLY IN 8PRO BUT ALSO IN 8 SERIESMY DEVICE'S SCREEN ISN'T WORKING ANYMOREIT'S BEEN ONLY ONE MONTH SINCE I HVE BOUGHT IT.I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS DIVICE TO QNYONE ELSE.I APPROACHED THE SERVICE CENTER FOR THIS DEFECT BUT NO ONE REPONDED. Amazon call me : 6301863238

"
"

  Five star for- Design, performance, battery!

"
"

  Hi all, I am just fascinated with the display. overall looks & performance is phenomenal. Looks very premium in hands. Overall satisfied with this purchase.

"
"

  Do not waste your money, one plus has serious issue of their display. Display has Black crush, you will not enjoy videos on the scree, even cheap 5k phone is better.

"
"

  Super smoth experience with all new OnePlus super sleek in design.Great built quality 👍👌

"
"

  Switched from IPhone to OnePlus. Quite sleek and stylish phone. Performance is amazing. Camera is good. Features are interesting. Need improvement in battery life. During lockdown I keep hotspot of my phone open. This may drain bettery faster. But thank to warp charger. 40 mins to 1 hour  it takes to completely charged

"
"

  This is a better pick than the OP8 Pro in every way apart from the camera and water resistance rating. Same internals, same beautiful UI, but friendlier size, better battery life, less curvature on the display, and much better value. What's not to love?

"
"

  Finger print sensor is double ok, but I am not satisfied with battery, becoz the battery drained too fast while using net  like a old mobile ie 2 to 3 yr used phone.  when battery is charging the hand set is also  heating. The price of this mobile  little bit high for this specs.

"
"

  Excellent display, good camera, over all a good buy than one plus 8 pro i am using 12gb/256 versionBest buy for gaming ,

"
"

  This mobile is gives me so amazing moment to me.

"
"

  Battery life Average, fingerprint sensor is not up to the mark mostly fails, as. A premium set it value for money

"
"

  Since first day the phone getting struck.

"
"

  The battery gets drained out faster compared to other devices of one plus. Have complained to amazon for a refund or replacement of the device. It is less than 15 days since I started utilising. Not overall happy with the product . Been using one plus otherwise from last 4 years

"
"

  Fabulous phone..business apps like Wooqer, bi, qms, cloudcherry all fat excell, all are working fine... Thats what I was in need in actualCamera is not amezing as it was expected but its just okBetry is compunsated with fast chargingFingerprint is ok

"
"

  Day 3 - OnePlus 8It's an excellent device. Value for money. For heavy users, battery may not be that supportive.

"
"

  Have got this product last week only and facing huge issue with battery back-up as it drains very quickly and doesn't last for more than 12-16 hours and if on video mode than not more than 6-8 hours. Apart from battery issue the product is excellent great screen, ease in typing and camera.

"
"

  This is an absolute bad experience with the phone! We are trying to reach Amazon for a replacement phone but with no luck because the battery of this phone is just weak!

"
"

  HiPhone is good. But I m facing a problem in opening of photo gallery. As I try to open this photo gallery, it's window disappeared. Pl sort this problem or replace it my phone. I have never face this kind of problem earlier on.Regards

"
"

  Display not working after 15days of useVibration is working but displays not workingIt’s the 1+ phoneI recommend to everyone one not to. Use onePlusJust buy only iPhoneI want to replace it with other but Amazon not accepting

"
"

  Its not a flagship phone, dont expect more,  u ill get more ram and rom. Rest of the things are normal and One plus 8 Camera clarity is bad as compared to another one plus models.

"
"

  Mobile is very good but it gives some problem of touch function. It is high priced than quality. Overall it's a good product. I purchased with 12 GB RAM by paying almost 10k more but 8 GM RAM should be more than enough for a good use.

"
"

  as soon as i opened it their was something wrong with front camera. i retued it on next day. still to get my refund back from amazon

"
"

  Tooo goood. Must buy. The best is the screen. Edges are way too good.

"
"

  The product is absolutely brilliant but I got a little problem with the vendor of this product..I have mail them so many times that we want a gst invoice of the product..they are not able to send that...please rectify this urgent

"
"

  I Like the OS and the Refresh Rate...There is no dislike for this beast because it is OnePlus.But I got a bug or something that type c to 3.5mm cable is not working in my device... So I returned my deivice...

"
"

  First time Oneplus, I like display And battery. Deliveried on time. Good delivery service.

"
"

  What a camera. Really impressed with the camera quality. Love it.

"
"

  I liked the performance but dislike part is assembled the Phone is poor the back panel is not have the perfect glue

"
"

  Camera -not meet expectationsDisplay -like qhd in this price ..Processor- goodLook- perfectBattery- meet expectationsGo for 7t pro if u want a clear display...

"
"

  nothing changes in the software and nothing new just the same as previous versions.so if ur expectations are plzz come to ground...bcos it has nothing new in useability.

"
"

  Good product. But not at all happy with the delivery time and customer support response.

"
"

  1.Charging complaint ,2.Over heating while charging.3. I have used the one plus 6 since 3 yrs, even much better compare to one plus 8.4. One plus 8 worst phone compare to one plus 5

"
"

"
"

  I love this thing, I start my day with this and this is were my day ends.it doesn't need much charge and it's a beast when it comes to gaming or camera

"
"

  Amazing product reasonable price value of the money hi-fi performance very good product Enough Ram enough storages very well prossesor

"

  Excellent features & battery life. Fast charging & 6 month extended warranty free of cost. I think company should ramp up production to meet demand .

"
"

  Value for moneyDisplay is very goodBattery is nice.can stretch full day with regular usageProcessor is fast and smoothSoftware glitch is there hopeiy wil improve

  OnePlus 8 super phone but just 4month OnePlus company release new phone 'OnePlus Nord' same futures better camera just 30000rs it was injustice to OnePlus 8 mobile user's....

"
"

  Brilliant Phone.Smooth operation.

"
"

  Not satisfied with oneplus this time too much laging & hanging problems in os. camera should be improved.No where near my expectations dont be as samsung oppo & vivo.

"
"

  The battery backup is too low . It only gives 3 hours backup for me

"
"

  One plus is one of the best

"
"

  Not upto the mark.Average in this range.

"
"

  Mobile wise good but poor battery ☹️. Not satisfied with mobile battery 😑

"
"

  Great phone ,enjoying the experienceI have recently shifted from iPhone ,the quality of touch ND camera ND performance is great than iPhone

"
"

  the phone started to get choppy and fixed in the same state since second day only, looks like a third grade quality used in the product, extremely disappointed.

"
"

  Genuine product. Functions extremely fast and responds really quick. 90hrz screen is absolutely game friendly.

"
"

"

  Moblie is not accept finger print and face lock....only pin accept.... and frent camera also not full size only pic is 4:3, 1:1 screen..... Very bad

"
"

  This phone is a true flagship killer💯Everything is smooth.Using this device from almost one month now but no issues at all. Oneplus you nailed it again🔥

"
"

  The phone has started giving problems. Have written to one Plus support but poor response. Can you help?

"
"

  The mobile was very useful with low cost comparing to Samsung costly mobiles and the speed was occasiom

"
"

  What is the problem with the battery? I have charged it 2times in 24hrs.. what is wrong? Rest everything is perfect, even it's heating,while use

"
"

  Speed of the phone and camera are too good...no doubt about it but you can only connect bluetooth device to it and not earphones or headphones.

"
"

  So let me be honest at the outset, Samsung Galaxy series define my benchmark as I had been using galaxies - S6,S7 & S8 before moving on to One plus. What got me to give up on my last Galaxy was it's pathetic battery backup. Here, One + definitely outperforms it's rivals and easily gives a day long backup despite heavy usage. Also, it's super quick charge functionality is quite handy.The phone works super fast without any lags whatsoever. The face recognition, finger print sensors work like a charm - I hope it does not come at the cost of reducing the security quotient. What I don't like is the premium factor which is completely missing. Firstly, the phone is overly bulky and is surely not meant for single handed operations - I so miss the form factor of my Samsung S8. The other thing missing in this Phone is a good user interface. Again Samsung beats One Plus hands down. Coming to the display quality, the colour renditions or the crispiness of an Amoled screen is just not there. Camera is the biggest let down. Image stabilization does not seem to work at all with me ending up with blurred images most often than not. A peculiar observation seen is that with low lighting and front camera on,  the picture either becomes completely red or completely blue! All in all, I repent spending 45k on this one. Note that I am not a gamer hence cannot comment on pubgs and the likes.PS: Bought this from Reliance Digital and not Amazon.

"
"

  Pros:stereo speakers are good, due to screen refresh rate screen experience good, camera is also good.Cons:I was using oneplus 6T before buying this one, rest all is good but battery life sucks.Battery life in oneplus 6T lasted for more that one day, but with same amount of usage oneplus 8 nearly makes it for one entire day, even though the battery capacity is more than 6T. It's because of the screen being amoled with high refresh rate, I believe.Even after letting go of many of the features that consume battery still no significant improvement in battery life.

"
"

  Better than Mi 10 .

"
"

  Pro:Dolby speakersBattery backupDisplaySpeedCamera could be little betterCan work on Phones back look.Cons:No Wireless charging

"
"

  It's the best phone you could get in this range. This is a real flagship killer.The camera quality and speed is amazing

"
"

  I always used One plus but now I am moving out of Chinese Phones. As they get huge profit from such high end phones. I will never buy a Chinese phone.

  Phone automatically switched off what a surprise Oneplus 8  never settle  very very disappointed for this phone i am waiting last 65 days this device

"
"

  So, I recently bought a new One plus 8 device. A couple of days back when I received it, I was really excited to use it. I did read on a couple of websites that there was some issue with the display. But I still ordered it thinking it would be fine. Just like I read earlier, I switched off the lights in my room, and I manually set the brightness of my new phone between 20 to 30%. I then opened my chrome browser and checked if there were any issues with the grey background with no tabs open. Upon tilting the phone a little, I could clearly see the finger print scanner beneath the screen. I was literally shocked as the rumors were true. I then called a friend of mine who got his phone a few weeks back. I really thought that if this was just an issue with my device, I’ll simply get it replaced. I called my friend and asked him to meet me. I did the same thing on his device and didn’t see the fingerprint scanner beneath the screen. However, what I did see was even more surprising. I saw the icons on his homescreen were clearly appearing in the background of Google chrome. Keep in mind, there are no tabs open and it’s just Google chrome with no tabs open. On the grey background, I could clearly see the imprints of his homescreen icons and I was shocked once again. He didn’t notice it until I told him and he was surprised too. I just want to let you guys know that there is seriously some issue with One plus 8 displays. Please don’t buy these devices until the issue is resolved. I’m even sharing the pictures confirming the same.Thank youA verified buyer from Amazon

  I have been using Oppo Reno 10X Zoom, it is for 5G l purchased 1+8. Overall it is agood phone and slightly better than Oppo Reno. Performance of front and Rear Camera are good and slightly better than Oppo Reno. Battery back up is good and gets fully charged within one hour, without any heating issue. At 90 refresh rate display is good. Preloaded bloatware is comparatively less compared to other brands. Some unnecessary apps of  Google and 1+8 are still there. Finger Print senser is excellent. I have not experienced any hanging issue.  Rarely applications get closed and have to be opened afresh. On a few occasions the phone was ringing indicating incoming call but screen was blank. A reboot solved the issue.  Overall this is a good phone for midrange users.

"
"

  Awesome Mobile.. Very much satisfied..great purchase..After 10 days of using.. Charging very fast.. From 30% to 100% takes about 40 min..Pic quality is Awesome ... Very fast.. No lagging..Till not played any big games... But small games quite fast and responsive..

"
"

  Performance is absolutely brilliant. Need improvements in battery life and camera quality in low light.If you're not specifically looking for the best processor in market, better go for OnePlus Nord which is almost half in price.

"
"

  Does not need any review. It's a beautiful phone. No one will regreat paying 50,000 for this. It ticks all the boxes.

"
"

  Battery Life is Horrible...Worst Than 2000 mAh..

"
"

  Good one but not the best in Oneplus range. The price is at the higher end amd could have been slightly lower

"

  I love the quality , size , function etc
