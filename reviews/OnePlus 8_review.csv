  First of All, OnePlus phones are now Made In India totally from the OnePlus 8 series. Even Apple phones are Made in China, but not OnePlus Now. Now coming to the Phone,The OnePlus 8 sets the bar high for affordable flagships in 2020. While its design refinements borrow elements from other flagships, it's an undeniably sleek phone, with waterfall display edges and a punch-hole for the front-facing camera. With a Snapdragon 865 and up to 12GB of RAM, the phone is high-performance despite costing notably less than most flagships, making it the cheapest ""5G"" phone in many markets.As for how the OnePlus 8 measures up to devices beyond those made by OnePlus itself, there's a compelling case to be made for this flagship phone. The OnePlus 8 performs as well as any leading Android device and even makes the iPhone 11 sweat a little. You'll get very good battery life — at least when the phone's faster refresh rate isn't taxing the battery.The display itself is the same size as the OnePlus 7T's, measuring 6.55 inches. It's an AMOLED panel, with a full-HD+ resolution, HDR10+ compatibility, and a refresh rate of 90Hz. OnePlus also brags about the panel's high colour accuracy. From what i have seen so far, the display is definitely bright, with good sunlight legibility and punchy colours. You also get lots of options in the Settings app to tweak the colours to your liking.For a phone with such a big screen, the OnePlus 8 doesn't take up that much space, at least when it comes to width. At 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches, OnePlus' phone is taller than the iPhone 11 (5.94 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches) and Galaxy S20 (5.9 x 3 x 0.31 inches), though not as wide. With 8mm of thickness, the OnePlus 8 is also fractionally thinner than Apple's iPhone 11, so you'll have minimal trouble slipping the OnePlus device into a pocket. At 6.3 ounces, it's lighter than the iPhone 11, too, though not as light as the 5.7-ounce S20.The OnePlus 8 comes with a 4,300-mAh battery — bigger than the 3,800-mAh power pack in the OnePlus 7T though not as large as the 4,510 mAh battery you'll get by paying up for the OnePlus 8 Pro. That shouldn't matter too much, as the OnePlus 8 delivers superlative battery life.A bigger tradeoff that OnePlus 8 owners have to make, at least compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, concerns the cameras. While the Pro model features four lenses, the OnePlus 8 sports only three — and one of those isn’t a telephoto lens. Instead, the 48-megapixel main shooter with its f/175 aperture and 16MP ultra wide camera are joined by a 2MP macro lens. That's great, in theory, for taking detailed objects, but if you want to zoom in, you're at the mercy of a digital zoom that can add noise to your shots. But yes, its getting betterand better with every other updates OnePlud is launching like every week.Overall, would i recommend this phone? Obviously Yes, its a steal deal for the price! Plus you get the best android experience! (I would say even better than iOS)

  Great Performance, fingerprint is quite fast and great batter life.

  It's fantastic phone. Performance is excellent. Curved screen is just a gimmick. Not recommended for small hands as the device is very tall. Fingerprint sensor is good too. Rear cameras are good (except the macro) and front camera is decent.9/10

  I am a iphone user basically first time i switch to android very good phone oneplus bt not a handy phoneProduce very heat when u play pubgOr continusely use after 1 hourYou can not touch ur phone when the heat comes not a highly functionable phone if u r a one plus lover then go for one plus 7 otherwise go for other for me rating this phone 1/5 unsatisfied

  I upgraded from OnePlus 5 to OnePlus 8 and the upgrade is worth. Display, fingerprint scanner, audio, in-hand feel everything is just mind boggling.I don't know why people are commenting that camera is not good. What they want in a 45k smart phone? A sony Alpha mark3? Believe me camera is superb. No complains and l didn't find any cons, it just fits perfectly in my expectations and my daily usage.Just go for it. There is no better alternative to this phone in this price bracket.

  Camera quality is worst....Its good only in sunlight .In in doors, image postprocessing messes up the entire pic, looses all sharpness .The same problem is there in both front and rear camera.My oneplus 5T takes much clearer images.Cant imagine how a 8th gen phone takes inferior pics compared to a 5th gen phone with much lesser hardware specs.

  Front camera on this device is a joke. It is blur and hazy. DISAPPOINTED

"
"

  Really disappointed with the device. I don't understand why OnePlus isn't focusing on quality check. Got the product with defective display.There is screen burn and the shadow of in-display fingerprint is visible.Amazon agreed to return it, really appreciate the Amazon service.However, I have got this product in a flash sale and now I have to wait for another sale.

  Only good thing it has is oxygen os ,so much for brand3rd camera is useless bcz company rolled back its features so basically it is 2 camera phone on backBelieve it or not it touch features r on bitter side and u should go with any other phones such as realme x50 pro with more features on every field but oxygen os then this one plus overall 3.5stars I felt like one or 2 times it hangs a little bit but it maybe due to its touch issues even after update which says that touch issues have been solved overall it's price should be around 38k but don't know which features helped to be 45k  u would say 90heartz refresh rate but realme provide this all features +65w dart charger plus 4k less and made in india.

  I am a fan of one plus series and have been using one plus 5t since a long timeWhen I received this product, my hopes were really high! But when I started using this phone I feel a bit dissappointed..-The finger touch unlock isn't very fast, one plus 5 t was way better in this case- Camera expectations are not fulfilled, pics have a bit animated quality- Notification light isn't present like it was in one plus 5t. The light blinks only when you get a notification and that too it's so light that you would barely notice.- 1 little bug > front cam settings to set the aspect ratio isn't differentiating between 4:3 and 'full' size- A little lag was observed when clicking a selfieSadly, I think paying 45k for this phone isn't worth

  I was loyal samsung phone user thought to try hands on Oneplus series, bought Oneplus 8. I am highly disappointed with the Ghost touch issues. While chatting on Whatsapp or other messaging app it get exit to home screen automatically. Also quality of battery is very poor, it will get discharged in 6hours of normal use. Oneplus & Amazon is big brand i suggest you to have quality check before dispatching products. Such poor management in quality will lead to tarnishing of image in market.

  Don't recommend this phone, not worth the money, the below problems being faced:1.  My jio voice stops working suddenly though signal strength shows good. Need to restart phone to resolve it.2. Data connectivity is very in consistent.  A 200 mb file upload gets restarted several times. My mi lower end phone in the same location, same Carrier has no such issues.3. Battery dries fast.4. Phones heates up fast

  I am facing display issue from the next day I bought this mobile I asked for replacement as the product is causing problem from the beginning. Customer support arranged a visit of technical person at my doorstep, he inspected the device and I showed him the issue I faced. He assured me to process my replacement case but till date my mobile is not replaced and on the other hand no one is helping me or updating me about the status of issue I faced. I hoped customer support would have addressed this issue with proper support but I am not satisfied the way they handled this case. Instead I am sad that the customer support for such expensive commodities are such pathetic.

  Extremely well build phone.Excellent display.Very good operating system, still I prefer Samsung OS.Excellent battery backup.Still good value for your money.Don't think twice, just go and buy the phone.

  My order details stated that this product was sold by Darshita Electronics and it didn't have a warranty card inside it. I wonder if this is an original product and will the warranty be still applicable?Also, one plus claims 1% to 50% in 22 minutes. However I charged from 2% for 24 minutes and it reached 42%. The second reason to wonder if this was an original product!!

  One and only best android phone which has tremendous network speed, beast performance (90 Hz, S865) and best camera quality.

  Oneplus mobile is have some premium looking and feeling premium but delivery service is very very bad too late delivery my mobile my account is Amazon prime account one day delivery guaranteed but deliver 10 days long time phone is awesome unbelievable performance good features new technology and after all latest 5G technology

  I want to replace this handset with new one coz this phone is not working properly. Screen light is flactuating , time to time get hanged, earphone is doesn't work properly, when phone is restarted then works properly . From day 1 I'm facing problem.. I couldn't register request coz I got delivered in delhi.. and after that I came to Ranchi , and Amazon was not accepting written request from ranchi so I am fed up with this phone and I want refund for this phone.

  Coming from samsung S series I can compare if this phone should be called flagship, or this is so called flagshipPros:I like the overall design. Front design comes from Samsung edge models.Battery backup is good with SOT of approx 7 hours in a day.Color reproduction is fine. Don't compare it with Samsung's display.Cons:Camera: rear is still fine, could have been better, however front camera sucks. The picture quality and colour reproduction is average.Charging: phone heats up to a level sometimes where you can't hold it.The camera bump and linear set up looks odd. 2 megapixel camera ? Shouldn't be there. More than uselessSoftware: though I like the idea of stock Android, the gboard isn't that great like Samsung, and few tools like select and share are missing.Cost cutting on wire size. It's not even 1 mtrNo memory card or Hybrid slot.For this price no earphones? Not even converter?Online reviews are only paid while the compare S20 with OnePlus 8. This doesn't have IP rating or 2K screen and no earphones. Don't let them fool you. It's not reasonable anymore.

  This phn is not recommended at all.Earlier i thought OnePlus is doing great but after buying one plus 8 i m thinking i made a blunder. The phn is getting heated and Discharged without even using it. The gaming experience is also not upto the mark. My earlier Redmi Note 9 pro was better than this.

"

  Don't waste money:I am writing review for those who want buy this product..Camera :Honestly this mobile is not for photography.Front camera seems like vga. Very very bad quality.Rear camera captures things wahich are steady but if you in lill motion then photo quality is like noob camera.Finger prit sensor.Sucks lot time to recognise.Face lock. Works fine more than good.Gaming:. Very good . But gyro sometimes misbehaves. Multi touch sometimes not working. Claw players can getting trouble.Touch:Multi touch sometimes not workingNetwork: Not good,not getting calls, telling not available to callers.SpeedVery good.Etc etc..

"

  You can't just go wrong with this one. From screen to battery life everything is best in class. Lasts easily for a day with normal usage. The charging speed is insane. Charges the phone from 0 to 100 in just about n hour. The phone is totally a value for money in the 40k price segment.The 90 hdz refresh rate is a pleasure.The phone doesn't skip a beat when playing graphic intense games like pubg.The oxygen OS is as smooth as ever. Better than any android skin in the market.One con i may have noticed is that of camera. The camera is good in most circumstances but may be underperforming in some situations. Not that the camera is bad. The software updates are making a difference in the camera department.

  A little hang here n there in new phone, disappointing. rest all is as expected. N on top of that AMAZON would not give me the amazon pre book offer cashback. complete nonsense. so disappointed with amazon. intial order was a transaction failure and they say its only valid on first transaction😡.same transaction i tried just after few seconds with same card and same details it went smoothly. it feels lik a scam from amazon to just lure people with offers and not honor it later. It would b better to avoid amazon from next time.

  Switching from samsung s series to OnePlus.Pros1. Battery life is excellent.2. You don't need to have a power bank with this type of charging speed.3. The curved edge display I like about Samsung is in this phone though samsung removed it.4. The processing speed is so fast. Apps open within a book of an eye.5. The display is as good as Samsung s series phones.Cons1. Camera quality is not that much good.2. The sound quality can be better.

  DEAR FRIEND,HELLO,WHEN ANY VIDEO / AUDIO IS SWITCHED ON ON MY """"ONE PLUS 5 G""""MOBILE PHONE THERE IS AN ELECTRICPOWER PASSAGE AND CURRENT SHOCK AT THE  BOTTOM RIGHT HOLE ADJACENT TO THE CHARGING POINT. IAM PLANNING TO BRING IT TO THE NOTICE OF YOU AND TO  ONE PLUS NOTICE,AND ALSO SHOW IT IN THEONE PLUS HYDERABAD AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER.AND IF IT IS NOT RECTIFIED I AM FORCED TO RETURN ITBACK TO YOU.REGARDS,TRULY,GOVARDHAN RAO PANCHINENI.

  Negative- 48mp main camera image processing, the images dont have enough saturation and colours look washed up. It can be easily rectified by editing and just slightly increasing the saturation, but its a 45k rs phone it should do it by itself.Positive- Everything even including other cameras the 12 mp wide angle camera has perfect colours. performance is crazy can easily beat any phone without sd 865 and can also compete with iphone 11. Superfast charging, great battery life and the best part is the display and 90hz refresh rate love it. Great phone OnePlus.

   there is nothing which you hate about this phone.sometimes it heated up but apart from that flagship performance, the better camera than ever and best UI experience.

"
"

  Pros..1. Good display. The slightly curved edges looks great and feels comfortable for gesture navigation. There are no display issues in my unit.2. Performance is blazing fast3. Battery will easily last you one day with average usage4. Clean UI with 3 years of software supportCons..1. Expensive compared to the previous 7T model.2. Camera not that great. Good for snaps under proper lighting3. Feels delicate with the curved screen.Buy this if..1. You want to use the phone for more than 3 years2. You want the best performance and build quality3. Camera is not that important to you4. You want stock UI

  I have used the phone for a week now. Battery life is awesome, lasts me more than a day (includes me attending live webinars, videos and heavy browsing) Camera quality is great (works brilliant ly during low light too). The oxygen OS is simply mind blowing. Aesthetically superior design and elegant look.Go ahead, this is indeed a great phone!

  I used phone nearly 1 day not more than that i packed it and request for return, this is my 1st flagship phone i don't even use smartphone above 20k so i really excited for it, but its battery is avarage not even slightly above than average, when i get smartphone its around 60 percent so in next 2 hour did all setting like opening account and etc. Its become 22percent then 40percent down in just 2 hour so i charge it when it get 78charged i remove it from charged then it hets much but bcoz of case i didn't fill its heat then i removed the case and i touches the back its really heated too much and its only on charging even my mi note 5 pro so i decided to return it, and also its front camera is not impressive sometime fingerprint scanner of my device faild to detect plenty of time i need to enter password or use face unlocked to enter in device, and a small issue is only gmail app getting shut down automatically if i trying to add new account, i really wanted to use OnePlus smartphone but problem like such really disappointed me ! I think that's why probably people don't shop online

  The OnePlus 8 uses the Snapdragon 865 SoC and supports 5GBattery life, gaming performance, and the display are its strong suitsIt doesn’t get an IP rating or wireless charging like the Pro modelOnePlus 8 Design: Subtle, yet distinctiveI wasn't a big fan of the circular camera bump on the OnePlus 7T and I'm glad that's gone away. However, I do miss the frosted finish of the glass back. The Onyx Black version of the OnePlus 8 has a glossy finish, which picks up fingerprints very easily. It's also very slippery, which did result in accidental drops when I had the phone lying on a chair's armrest. There's a case provided in the box, which should help.The display now has a hole-punch cutout, in the upper left corner. OnePlus has said goodbye to the notch and I think it's for the best. The hole-puch isn't the smallest I've seen but it gives the OnePlus 8 a fresh look.As I mentioned in my first impressions, the OnePlus 8 is surprisingly comfortable to hold given its display size. It's also slim and not too heavy. The black version looks fine, but I was really looking forward to seeing the Interstellar Glow trim first-hand, as I feel that that's the colour to get.As you'd expect, build quality is excellent thanks to the curved-edge front and back glass sandwiching the metal frame. The buttons are easy to reach, and the alert slider is handy as always. The USB Type-C port, SIM tray, and main speaker are lined up on the bottom.Overall, the new simplified design is welcome, and I like that OnePlus isn't trying too hard to impress. This phone might look a bit boring in the pictures, but it's instantly recognisable as a OnePlus device.The OnePlus 8 has a simple, yet distinctive designOnePlus 8 Display: Bright and vividThe display is one of the most important parts of any smartphone, and the OnePlus 8 has a very good one. It's a 6.55-inch AMOLED panel with sloping sides, a wide colour gamut, and a hole-punch cutout in the upper left corner. OnePlus has used 3D Corning Gorilla Glass in addition to the pre-applied screen protector. I found the latter to be more of an annoyance than anything since my finger grazed against the edges when swiping in from the sides.Other specifications include a resolution of 2400x1080 (full-HD+) pixels, HDR10+ support, a 90Hz refresh rate, and software features like reading mode, night mode, and the ability to boost colours when playing videos.The 90Hz refresh rate makes usage in general feel fluid and snappy. You can drop down to 60Hz if you want to save a bit of battery power. HDR content looks very good on the OnePlus 8. When playing compatible shows through Netflix, the brightness and colour saturation automatically get a boost. This goes back to normal once you exit the app.The OnePlus 8 has an in-display fingerprint sensor, which is super quick at authentication. All it takes is a quick, firm tap to unlock it. Face recognition is equally fast and works decently well in dim lighting. You can enable the ‘double-tap to wake' gesture, but what I really wanted was a raise-to-wake gesture, which is still not an option.The 'Ambient display' feature offers a peek at which apps have sent you alerts when the screen is off, along with the time, battery level, etc. However this isn't always-on and only shows up when you tap the screen or pick up the phone. It even shows you the name of the music track being played, but you can't control playback from here.One thing to note is that since the hole-punch cutout isn't very close to the top edge, any app that needs to black out this area will have to create a thick black bar. This is most noticeable in some games and video apps, when you need to hold the phone horizontally. You can also black out the area permanently but that just looks odd.The display is one of the best features of the OnePlus 8OnePlus 8 Performance: Keeping it coolWith its top-end hardware, it's hardly surprising that performance from the OnePlus 8 is impressive. However, what really caught our attention is that it doesn't heat up all that much in the process. That's not something we could say for the Mi 10 5G (Review), for example. The OnePlus 8 aces through benchmarks too. In AnTuTu, we got 5,78,289 points, while GFXbench's Car Chase graphics test returned 46fps, which is one of the tougher scenes in the suite. The sides and a few spots on the back, below the camera, do get warm after non-stop benchmarking, but never too hot. This speaks a lot about the thermal management design of the phone.

  1)Phone is quite slippery, can't use without a case.2)Display issue i.e black bar near camera punch and finger print reader is in almost every set but not visible in 99pct of regular usage3) with OnePlus releasing z within a 1 month of launch of OnePlus 8 makes one wonder why not launch all three together and will make OnePlus8 not a logical choice for many.4) camera is avg. Not upto par with a budget flagship camera of let alone of samsung s10lite.5) battery is avg 7-8 hrs of sot but 0 gaming and just Netflix and social media. So it is not something huge or ground breaking.single charge can get you thru the day of moderate usage and might need to charge for 30-40 min more before you can use it for late night binge watching.6) watching Netflix or any video is a breath taking experience combined with a dolby Atmos stereo speakers. No complaints and quite impressed here.

  When the brand OnePlus initially came into market, it came up with one gutsy move, 'First come first serve limited stocks only policy'. It sure caught the attention of many, especially with the phrase - 'flagship killer'. I really had my eyes on it, but finally joined the OnePlus family for the first time with me proudly purchasing the OnePlus 8.OnePlus 8 - simply filled with pros pros and more pros, with a very few unrecognisable cons.Pros:-1) Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 is simply a beast, always prepared to handle and face the tasks we give it with a flair.2) Hardware - 8 unlike the 8 Pro is not officially IP certified, but is surely geared up to face any shockers or surprises. Be it anything on the device, RAM, graphics, built, weight, audio input and output, haptic feedback, buttons, screen, cameras etc., You name it, 8 proudly ticks all the boxes3) Software - Oxygen OS is one of the best, if not, the best Android skin in the market now, period.4) Design - the usability, equal weight management with the finesse is awesome.5) Display - 1080p full HD fluid AMOLED with a 90Hz refresh rate brings the smile to your face each time it's seen and used.6) Audio - Stereo speakers and the microphone blows over the expectations, so good.7) Cameras - even though it's the same camera hardware from the previous models, with improved software updates gives you a fine picture and video experience, with great details and quality.8) Connectivity - 5G, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC - all latest versions, in short - future ready.9) Sensors - Top notch.10) Battery - will comfortably provide the user with more than a day's worth of heavy usage, coupled with WARP charge, it's ready to go.11) Protection - Gorilla glass 5 coupled with aluminium frame, and a bit of water and dust resistance gives peace of mind.Cons (I personally really don't mind these, but hey, every coin has 2 sides):-1) Pricing - Flagship killer is messing around with the the pricing.2) No wireless charging - This is a complete personal preference.3) Camera - 2MP Macro camera, really makes no sense.4) No 3.5mm jack. But with great wireless headphones and speakers out there, it's again a personal preference.5) Expandable memory - With the competition heating up, not having one is bit of a bummer, but completely negotiable.I got all excited with the launch of the OnePlus Nord, was planning to pick one up too. That's when the 8 grabbed my attention. With all the future proofing and finesse, it's simply speechless...If you are willing to spend the money and have no changes in mind for the next 3-4 years, blindly go get this beauty with a beast inside...Proud to have joined the OnePlus family with the 8, which is also the primary OnePlus phone with the updated logo, in short - Stay unique in the crowd. 😎

  Everything is amazing in this phone. Phone lasts a day easily in single charge under normal usage. Turn on the 90hz display and wow what an experience hurts battery for sure. Sound amazing. Charging amazing. Display amazing. Camera could've been a little better, it's not bad but could be better. Best part oxygen OS just love the simplicity and yet customisable to tweak to your likings best OS for mobiles out there. In short worth buying. Go for it.

  Starting with Display- If you are the one who is thinking of buying 1+8 and is concerned about display issues (black crush and all) and is going through reviews every minute to see if someone reports it, I can say that- I too did the same as you are concerned right now. The device does not have display issues. But yes, there's something going on with 1+8 Pro Model.Cost- Considering given specifications: Processor/Camera/Lightning fast speed- You should definitely consider this one.Performance - Buttery smooth.Heating issues- When there's a lot of going on and the battery is about to die and then when you start charging the device. HEATS UP.Mu suggestions- If you are thinking of buying this device-1. Consider buying back cover.2. For pulling out more performance out of the camera- Gcam ❤️ Enough said. Lol (That's the current meta).Just one concern with Amazon's Delivery- the packaging was good but the cosmetics included for covering some items were teared apart (was it a returned one????)

  My new oneplus 8 phone is facing an issue. I am unable to download anything in Google Playstore. Whenever I press install button for any app, it gets stuck on ""Waiting for download"". The only way to fix it by u installing the Google Playstore's update and run it in factory version.I want to know whether this is a glitch or a bug that would be fixed through an OTA update or I have to go and visit a service center? I'm very upset because I had high hopes for the phone.

  As a great fan of oneplus,in previous segment (7,6 series) no such issues i have faced. Within a period of 13 days i feel so many issues in my oneplus 8 like display flickering,color changing, can see pixel nearby the fingerprint area ,battery drainage and so on. When contacted oneplus , they say ask amazon to do necessary,then when contacted amazon they said to seek help from oneplus . Every day the issues becoming worse . With all the documents i had sent mails to each .

  Fingerprint reader takes considerable amount of time to recognise my finger and it even failed to do so in certain cases. Face recognition is amazing, superbly fast.Oneplus did not do well with the battery life at at at all.. it drains as far as it charges and is pretty disappointing tbh.Camera will keep you coming back for more. Kudos to that.Butter smooth operation and certainly speed.The case that comes in the box is not the best one, you can opt for a sandstone one from oneplus which are pretty good as well.Device doesn't heat up easy and looks classy in my hands. Very sleek and premium feel definitely worth every penny!Tions of customisation features available.Please be careful and don't mistake the mic aperture for sim tray ejection.. so take care about that coz they lie pretty close to each other on the bottom corner of the phone.Sweaty hands donot smudge the screen which is probably a great blessing for people belonging to humid coastal areas like me!!Overall id say oneplus could have done better but the bench is still set pretty high!!!!

  Recently I purchased Oneplus 8.My expectation regarding the brand was top notch. I truly regret my buying decision. The display of the phone is pathetic. As you can see clearly, there is a blank green tint appearing near to my finger print sensor. I was actually using light theme before and it was less noticeable. So I couldn’t identify it properly. But when I changed it to dark this it is clearly visible and my fate laughed at me since the return date was over.I mailed Oneplus and there was no response then I contacted Oneplus call centre and I couldn’t connect them for 4 days. After continuous effort on the 5th day I reached the call centre and they are telling me to wait. It is clear that the problem is regarding hardware.I searched whether any other customers has the same issue and I could see so many people reported the same. But they are not willing to agree their quality issues. They said I should wait for their next software update.I’m really irritated with the brand. Think twice before taking this brand.

  I am not sure whether its defective device I received or its manufacturing faults.1. Devise starts heating up even after only continuous texting of just 30 min.2. Poor battery back-up. If you have moderate to high usage of phone [excluding use of game/ high graphics app] battery needs to charge two time a day.3. Charger takes around 1.5 hours to get it charge from 15% to 100%. No fast charging.4. Adding to that its Camara quality. few features can only work with 12 MP option so whats the meaning of having 46 MP camara.This time One Plus has put expectation down with its 8 series.Special thanks to Amazon for taking product return instead of replacement due to lack of stock availability.

  This review I am giving after 3 months usage-I Don't recommend this phone, not worth the money, the below problems being faced:Negative:1. Calls not connecting even signal strength shows good. Need to restart phone/reset to resolve it.2. Data connectivity is very inconsistent. My lower end phone in the same location, same Carrier has no such issues.3. Battery dries fast.4. There are many inbuilt apps are missing (ex scanner, music...)5. Can't delete multiple selective messages, call history, where basic models has. To delete messages takes more time.Positive:1. Good looking very stylish, Quick Charging, Camera is Ok, display is good other than that nothing is good in this mobile.I was thinking the performance is better than iPhone 6 but it is lesser than basic Redmi Phone.

  I am having volte issue in my one plus 8,many times  the volte sign vanishes all of a sudden due to that I don't get any call....as my number shows switchoff. This is pathetic ....if you buy such a flagship mobile of Rs 45k it started creating problems like this....  After telling 3-4  times to Amazon customer care ,they are not ready to replace the phone.....

  Amazing phone and completely satisfied with it. First high end phone ever bought and didn't regret the decision at all. Really good battery back up, great camera, amazing screen touch feel and display quality.The 90hz display is something to look out for. Great price for the quality and features provided. And the look, it's killer. The back glass panel is just so good that it can be used as a mirror also.The camera is one of the best in its segment and the nightscape photography is also good. Happy with the battery life also, it lasts me almost the whole day on more than average use of the phone, approximately 4-5 hours of screen time. The on screen finger print is good but make sure you don't have any dust particle in your finger or screen for it work properly. The face detection is fast on the phone. If you like to listen to music or watch videos without the earphone, then the stereo speakers are going to make you happy.The gaming experience on this phone is amazing and make sure to turn on the game turbo through your game center to enjoy the best gaming experience. The display quality just mesmerizes you with its AMOLED screen that even the phone more than this price range does not offer. It really makes a difference in your visual experience.All in all, simply a great phone in the price range. Have loved it every single day of using it.. worth the price and buy.

  * Stunning display.You can understand only when you use it. I don't have any touch issues with the curved display.* Very bright display.I mostly use it at 20 - 25 % brightness indoors. OnePlus 8 Pro is even brighter when I compared both side by side. But this one is more than enough. Even in the brightest sun the display outshines.* Very Premium feel and very comfortable in hand despite being a huge display ( I like smaller displays over bigger ones). This one doesn't feel bad in hand though. Weight balancing is very well done. Being a big display one hand operation is not easy.* Blazing speed.* Phone gets little warm when playing graphical intensive games. As I use a case I don't directly feel the heat or warmth* Surprisingly louder speakers* Decent camera (I'm not a power user of camera)* Cleaner oxygen OS* Decent battery life with 90Hz* 90 Hz spoiled me. Now feeling that my iPad Air is straining my eyes.* Once paired with OnePlus bullet wireless z is a very good experience for calls and music (I'm not missing the 3.5mm music jack)* Warp charging is very good both for Phone and for bullet wireless z ear phones* Punch hole does not distract the full screen experience that much (I was worried before purchasing)Initially I waited to buy OnePlus 8 Pro. But couldn't get in the sale. Hence settled for OnePlus 8. But not a bad choice I would say. This is more than enough for my usage.

  It is smooth as every oneplus. Battery back up is fantastic. You can use phone for more than 2 days on normal usage. Haven't got much opportunity for testing camera outdoors due to covid.The only two issues iam noticing are with network and camera. Phone stops making calls and other side dialer receives switch off message when they dial. But data keeps working. When you attach videos in whatsapp, the video's playback is blurry.Will share if any improvements happen.

"
"

  What a phone, what a phone it is. It's a beast. Excellent display, smooth, fast and one of the best in the market right now. You can go through the reviews over n over but when the first time you will hold the phone in your hands you will notice that it's something different, it's a beast.With that being said it's built quality will give you that premium feel and the performance is flawless.Not too sure about the camera cause to be honest for me it's good enough as I am no expert in that field. But yeah I can bet that it will not disappoint you.Go for it.

"
"

  when you purchase a premium quality brand and invest so much money, you expect it to be top notch.Which is not the case with OP8. Im quite sure the issues with OP8 dont exist in OP8 Pro. This must be their business strategy to keep the sell of OP8 Pro alive.The fingerprint sensor is average. It takes all the time in the world to unlock.The camera is pathetic. My OP6 camera performs better than this.The back camera panel makes the photos too warm. It also increases the sharpness beyond too far.The front camera is not good either.Performance of the chipset is good, but that is what you expect from SD865Bettery life is not bad, not very good either.I was disappointed not to see 50W charger. A 30W charger has become new normal. Even Redmi mid range phones are offering 30W out of the box.

"
"

  Phone is good..Charging is very fast and holds good for good amount of time.Some times touch does not respond that much..One plus should also provide screen protector (not the  pre attached one) like back cover,atleast by collecting some price . Amazon delivery is also very good but they have serious issues regarding extra cash back promised after buying a gift card of 1000. After 2 months also, cash back is not received..

"
"

  Excellent Product!! Must say one of the best phones used so far..90hz Display awesome feels very smooth, 4300Mah battery life amazing really last long heavy user though, Great Camera setup with various options.....lil disappointed about night capture but all in all a very good & great product. Cheers to OnePlus for making such an excellent one & also keeping the price point in consideration. Thanks to Flipkart as well for there excellent & speedy delivery!!

"
"

  I had just one doubt, about curve display.i was always against the curve display but OnePlus gave a good solution to it curve but not fully curve as Samsung displays are this display is half curved n there are no chances of accidental touch if you are adult as adult hands are very comfortable with this display.hope this will help many people like me who thinks curve display can be problem but thanks to OnePlus for solve this with your device.

"

  Amazing....  Feeling happy ...

  You can buy this mobile for everything else which does not include photography.Its decent with gcam.I don't game or take photos much.Its great for me.Battery life is one day not more with dual sim.Charging is superbPerformance is unmatched.Design is premium.Light weightDisplay is greatSound output is great.Finger print scanner works 7 out of 10 Times.

"
"

  Everything is ok,very fast os and android 10,sd865 is awesome,camera is good,but litte dissatisfaction about camera,they didn't provide telephoto lens,and battery life absolutely awesome,OnePlus have to rectify Fullscreen problem,as we can't watch full display for prime video and best input is processor everything is beautiful .As I uploaded my Enfield photo there which is shotted with 48mp,video is good and macro lens are not worthy,finally good,and 30w fast charging is good but definitely it will take 1 hour time,some times finger print issues, it's not a major problem but sometimes and finally what I have to say you can buy it absolutely stunner and fine curve edges looks like beast and front cam is good and 5g is amazing because though in India we are using 4g but it's band width is getting so much speed when compared to my galaxy A50,so this is a flagship killer you can buy it 🔥🔥🔥.

"
"

  The product is excellent but a bit overpriced. Device is stunningly fast and tge display is eyecandy. Display is too good to watch fullhd and hdr content. The speaker is also good with dolby audio. One bad thing is they didnt included a type c to 3.5mm jack converter. And theres a slight issue in camera whick gave me very bright whitish images in some particular lighting conditions.  Because im not much camera guy i felt like the camera was okay, but there is some way some thing wrong with camera in very few pictures. Hope they are issues that can be fixed through an ota update.

"

  Let me tell you one thing straight if you want a good camera for the price you paid just don't go for 8 or 8T both have same sensors.Don't get me wrong this phone struggles with white balance, color contrast and accuracy. Ofcourse these can be updated via software updates but considering the time of release OnePlus 8 still didn't get a fix, now that's a bummer. (You won't notice this unless you have experience in premium devices.)Now pro's1. Build quality feels premium (but finger print magnet like most phones so nvm)2. Display is great not the best though. 402ppi is decent these days but you will notice the difference if you're coming from samsung higher end devices which usually have 450 - 510 ppi.3. Sound quality is excellent no compromise in this section.4. Software is the thing that holds OnePlus legacy. So no surprise in here they delivered the best.5. Battery is good at this range. With intense usage (graphics intense games like Genshin impact/pubg etc..) lasts 4.5-5 hours and under normal media usage lasts 8+ hours screen on time.6. The SD 865 paired with Adreno 650 can run anything intense. So you don't have to worry about your processing speed for atleast a couple of years if you're planning on keeping it long.Overall OnePlus 8 is an excellent device if you're looking past the camera. Hope it helps.

  I got the phone after 4 days as I stay in a remote area (Obviously because of Corona). The first thing to notice after I unpack is slim and nice mobile and the package was so nice.Regarding the details atleast from the first experience as I generally use iPhone is superb.Camera quality is top-notched with all the features. Don't believe in others says that camera quality is not good.... but rather, it is really really good. Depth recognization for portrait is ok but not at par with iphonesComing to the battery life, it is good as this mobile super display so considering the size and quality of display, battery life is goodDisplay and accessibility:  accessing applications are super easy and display is simply owesome (yay... oneplus)But since it is lack of wireless feature and only have this feature for oneplus 8pro, for oneplus 8 I feel it is bit expensiveOverall, good mobile, go for it, you would love it.

"
"

  Not the best camera. Phone is awesome for daily multi tasking, gaming and easily gives you one day of juice if you use 1 4G SIM. If you plan to use a dual SIM, make sure network is good in your area, or else with heavy use, you get 7hours of on screen time and about 18 hours of battery (with dual SIM in low network area) with WiFi and Bluetooth (connected to Wireless Z) ON always

"
"

  the delay in haptics when you type is just too long. feels like using a 10000rs phone. my mi a3 has 10 times better cameras then oneplus 8. the only pro of this phone is its fast. everything else is below average. samsung s8 screen is better than this one, let alone comparing it with latest samsung flagships. overpriced phone for no reason. front cam is unusable in indoors lights or after evening.

"
"

  So they sent me a defective product, and when asked to refund or replace they refuse to do either. They're making me run around their system and asking me to wait 2 days then this and that, it's quite frustrating. this is the 3rd defective phone they've sent me. Yes, 3rd defective. DO NOT BUY ONLINE FROM AMAZON! otherwise be prepared to  run after people who'll keep saying ""sorry sir system doesn't allow""

"
"

  I am posting this review after using one plus 8 for more than 2 weeks.One plus 8 satisfies it's standards in terms of processing. It is really fast. Display quality and Dolby Atmos are brilliant.But I am highly disappointed with camera quality. I would say if camera is your first priority then try other options in market, not one plus 8. One plus is only attracting the customer with the big number like 48mp or 3/4 cameras.  When it comes to the saturation, contrast and focus, the camera really struggles a lot.

  If u get mobile phone which is not working as expection then with return time amazon can’t give return/refund policy

  This piece is Owesome n I can bet on it. I have been using iPhone 11 & pro but this too is masterpiece. Design is really sleek, easy to handle and equally attractive. Superb processor and speed.Unmatched product under this range and real value for money. I don’t think one who wants to purchase this product will really be referring our reviews 😝🤭 but this really is a masterpiece.

  Very very poor product so many issue phone camera very bad software not working no update received touch screen not working please not purchase waste money😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂 please not purchase phone not profound full value of money 😠😥😥😭 WASTE money

  Phone size is absolutely perfect for me. It's slim and perfect fit in my hand. Display is butter smooth with its 90hz refresh rate and fell in love with its edge display, edge notifications etc. I would say, one of the best displays in smartphones. If you throw any high end games or any other tasks which required high processing power, then consider it as done smoothly. I don't have any worries in its performance department. Next is battery, for my usage I'm getting a day and few hours. It's obviously depends on your usage. I think for 4300 capacity battery, it's doing its job.And moving to camera department, front camera was pathetic when I received this phone but after receiving one update, that problem got resolved and it captures decent shots now. Good work one plus for rolling out patch updates for cam. And back primary and wide angle cam is good and takes excellent pictures. And the third one is a 2MP super macro camera.... no idea why OP added a 2 MB camera. And this is the only thing I didn't like it in this phone. Anyway I'm not using camera for that many macro shots..so for me it's not a deal breaker. Last part is its speaker's, one of the best stereo speakers available in current gen phones.Summary, a slim and stylish phone with great performance,excellent display, superb stereo speakers, good camera and above average battery life.

  HONEST REVIEW:Dont hesitate to buy , no drawback.its the perfect phone.when u will hold the phone people will peep in.Sound is more than speakers of TV. that loud 😍.The camera is Great except few drawbacks in low lighting but overall an decent camera to go for.Gaming is butter smooth. oneplus pubg are getting into a 90FPS gaming soon. buy it to get that benefit.moreover my uploaded images will tell u all points.BUY IT .

  I have been using Oneplus 8 for a week now, up till now it has impressed me. Before this, I was using a Redmi note 5 Pro.Since OP8 has an edge display, there can be a problem in using tempered glass and a rugged case at the same time. I searched for a lot of solutions and there weren't many. Anyway, I took a chance ordered a Spigen case from amazon and when I applied it, it started pulling off the screen film that came with the phone. The transparent case that came in the box with the phone does not look cool and won't give much protection to the phone.  So I went to a local store and got a UV glass (worth Rs 650 here) and now everything is fine, I can have the Spigen case and UV glass installed at the same time.Pros:* Excellent OS.* Rear cam is good (need to experiment more).* I like the punch hole front cam, but to some, they require a full display. Personal preference.* Display is top-notch.* Played PUBG, COD, mobile legends in top-spec. Amazing.* Extremely fast charging.* Slim and sleek design. Not very heavy.* Fingerprint is fast.* Speaker sound is also good.Cons:* Front cam should be improved.* Observed very slight heating at times.* Media issues while connecting some Bluetooth devices. My Redmi airdots is working fine, but sometimes my JBL shows some issues like low sound during calls, etc. I have seen these issues addressed in the Oneplus forum also. My friend is using the OnePlus neckband with this phone and it's working fine.My final opinion, OnePlus 8 is an amazing phone and I love it.But the price could have been less than 40k, not worth 45k.

  I have been the user of Oneplus since 3 years, and the quality has always been premium, though they have given na update and spoiled the camera for my previous divide one plus 5, I am forced to upgrade just because of the camera. Which I really felt very cheap from the companies perspective. Overall, this is a premium device if you can afford, else go for Nord rather than 8 series if you want to save a lot of bucks.

  i am writing this review after 3 days of usage:disclaimer :i am not a pro gamer or someone who goes behind excellent camerasIssues:  1) pathetic camera.. - even after being someone who doesnt care much about camera, i felt that the budget phones will have better ones.. the only good thing is ultrawide cam.  and the selfie cam sucks in low light  2) display-- overall its good, but i got a defective one.  which had green tint and red tints in low light  3) Alexa lacks something-- not impressed  4) horizontal light is hardly visible in good light conditions  5) fingerprint sensor light is very bright in low light conditions- something which is hardly tolerable  6) feel like there is issues with focusing in the camera especially for macro cam( i had a samsung phone taken 5years back- still i feel that it is better in terms of focusing and front cam)  7) PRICE--  personally feel that it is only worth 35k-40kpros--  many are there.. will be listing some  1) Speaker-- Its just amazing with the dolby atmos and the 2 speakers  2) Oxygen OS --except some bugs..  overall this provides an amazing experience  3) Battery -- good battery backup.. got 34hours of backup, with the screentime being 8hours and all background apps running  4)  design -  a premium feel  especially the onyx black colour looks exceptional  5)  display full hd --  even though it lacks qhd or higher resolutions, the difference is hardly visibleoverall it will be a perfect selection, if the price is within 35-40k  , otherwise i dont feel this as a good choice

  Product got delivered to me on 27th August and on 1nd September I started seeing something wrong with the display and later on that day phone started to turn on and off automically I complained about such to Amazon after 30-40 minute long call they arranged an technician for checking the phone such appointment was fixed for 4th September on 4th the technician came and mentioned in the report that the phone is defective but Amazon said that the report came after the expiration of the replacement window so we cannot do anything after a lot of request they didn't accept replacement instead they have arranged yet another technician appointment now I'm regretting buying this phone overall if I sum up the review of the phone I only liked the fingerprint sensor it's fast nothing else is good in it .

  Spec monster with friendly user interface and an awesome camera quality for the price.Its veryyyy pleasing to use this device.Trust me anyone can't complain anything on this device, once after using it in hand.Feels absolutely like a flagship.If you are coming from those crappy under 20k devices with their bloatware filled cluttery softwares,then this One Plus 8 will definitely amaze you. Ergonomics of this device are done right.It feels light in hand and that sturdy aluminium and Glass Sandwich build is definitely 🔥.The curved edge isn't annoying and is adds to the beauty of this device.If you don't zoom in a lot,then this camera is amazing and zoom is definitely usable until 5X.Macro shots can be replaced with Digital zoom in my opinion while the main and ultrawide cameras do great.Charging is damn good and we need not even worry of the battery life in a daily usage.Rest is a snappy experience in a beautiful dark mode interface.Don't think too much to buy it.This is definitely a future proof device which for sure is an extremely amazing Flagship killer phone.Give it a GO!😄🤘💥

  The Perfect Beast For Day To Day Life 🔥Grabbing this phone, Is really giving me releif that i choosed a right phone...The System is just best as Usual..RAM Optimization is Very BetterCamera is messed up but they said they'll make it better in next OTA Updates.Overall, All should buy this flagship phone 🔥

"
"

  Premium features and feel, good battery life, compared to other brands with similar features this phone is priced as value for money. Speaker quality is bad, actually OnePlus 5 and 6 have better speaker output. Connectivity for voice call needs improvement, frequent issues in audio quality while on a voice call.

"
"

  Mobile is power-packed with all available options and best feature which can compete IPhone camera and has awesome features... Macro photography is little bit shady but overall camera performance is good.Battery life is little dull and I believe it's not like one plus 7 or previous versions.Picture display is again a catch here and has the best in the market till date.Overall this is worth buying and with few system updates it matches the pace of the top rated mobile phones and a tough competition as well.Happy customer... Thanks Amazon for your prompt service

  It's heating while Charging & talking over 2 minutes and battery drain easily at 3PM ,I added here screenshot of heating and battery drainage,I am not using it for any game it's noraml work of phone,only 2 dyas ago I Bought this PhoneContinue drain battery

"

  I'm using this phone more than a month it has camera is better in this price only micro camera need to improvements90hz Amoled display its produce punchy color and vibrant to see natural colours and there are one day easily working battery with 30W charger so its simply good fingerprint is working smoothly and Snapdragon 865 fastest chipset in this phone for gaming multitasking and 5G network experience getting better day by day and this phone satisfies all regular or hard working expectations

"
"

  Bought this phone 4 months ago.Pros:1) Design2) Battery3) Performance4) Sound quality ( pretty loud actually 😂)Cons:1) CameraEspecially the front camera is not at all good. I have written a mail to Support team also, but I didn't get any reply.The pictures are blurry👻. Pictures taken in low light/ artificial light are not clear. After taking the picture, it lags a lot and then shows the picture( Optimization)..CONCLUSION:Excluding the camera, the phone is good. If the camera faults are fixed, this would be certainly recommended phone at this price👍👍👍

"

  Bad camera quality . Front camera is blurry . No stabalisation . Even on rear camera .  Its like a 10k mi phone .Battery finishes in a day only 11hr . Working hour probably 4hr .Not worth it .Better go for 20k Samsung phoneNo return policy

"
"

  Very poor camera quality particular in low light conditions, & assistive light for face unlock in Oneplus 8 doesn't work well I would rate OnePlus 6t much better & higher in all aspects compare to Oneplus 8, oneplus 6t camera is far better than 8 I would say OnePlus 8 is totally a waste of money

  My whole family is using 1 Plus, but first time we are facing such problems. After evry 10 minutes I have to restart the phone to get the network.

"
"

  I have received the mobile on 13th June 2020. After using the same for 5 days I would like to say that this is the first mobile I have purchased the brand One Plus which looks very premium in hand.  Works very smoothly. But I could not succeed in booking glacier green colour.

"
"

  Awesum experience!!! It is one of the best gadgets I have owned in recent times. Clarity is amazing... The entire experience is fabulous... Battery, Camera, Storage, Security features are amazing. If you are willing to buy something in this range then this is the phone for you .

"
"

  Had ordered on 27th n got delivered on 28th that is the best part of amazon, but phone wise it was expected that o eplus can do that, my display issue while scrolling down screen starts blinking that window and that i complained and now i am feeling that left side of phone while typing, touch response is quite slow. Now again i had complained about this and on 5th september again technician will come to check.. lets see another oneplus 8, hope that doesn't have any problem orelse again will return.So dear all after paying that much amount and you have to face such issues then its not worthful buying this, so be aware.

  Heating problem in my phone:When I charge my phone it gets heat up & it remains hot for hours.When phone is used for wifi hot spot it gets heat up.Battery efficiency:When my phone gets heat up battery falls so fast.Finger print sensor:When I use finger print sensor after disconnecting call it doesn't work.

  I got onyx 8 gb ram 128 gb today after 5 days, booked on 22nd June.While charging 1st time when switched off from 2% to 60% charged in just 30 mins. But took exactly 1 hours and 13 mins to get fully charged and even got heating problem while charging, so I ignored this as it was charging first time.But while playing pugb on high graphics HDR Extreme it was getting heated again even when I reduced frame rate from extreme to high same problem, so I am going to replace it.May be replacement will solve the heating problem.Camera quality is not so good or not bad.Battery backup is very good for 90hz display.

"
"

  OnePlus 8 is a bit down on the camera part but no issues on that too , rest the phone is a beast especially when it comes to OnePlus no doubt about the performance ,gaming is awesome it comes with fanatic mode that optimises the apps and notification in order to reduce the processing load , rest the 865 is itself a beast. A must buy product !

"
"

  I received this product in a good condition in an impressive pack. The amoled display gives a premium appearance for the phone. My only concern was battery life and Camera quality.  So far I am satisfied with the both.  As an iphone user for last three years I would say that the camera is not upto the mark when it compared to iphone (personal opinion), Still it is worthy. Especially in evening photography. No words on Battery which is a beast. I would recommend this phone to those who want a change from apple phones also those who seek an upgradation to premium phones.

"
"

  I guess manufacturing quality is bad for this seriesFrom day one onwards I got a problem while taking zoom in pictures and battery draining.So mobile inspection was done and he reported as replacement andim getting replacement at last thanks to amazon customer service and hoping I won’t get any issue for the replacement phone.

"
"

  Just perfect!!The Brand has its Value. No comparison.Only lag is fingerprint, That I felt bit slow, but that's fine for me.Camera- Excellent in day time as well as in complete dark room.Rest others has no comparison wit any other phone in this range.

"
"

  This is my first experience with one plus. As expected this piece gives a premium feel and won't disappoint you in any aspect except camera. I bought poco X2 for my wife for 17k. One plus doesn't come any close to camera quality or the level of detail it gives. For 45000 one plus should focused more on camera also since many competitors gives better with very cheap segments. Giving 4 star only because of camera... Else 5+

"
"

  Please buy this product very carefully because it has manufacturing defect, I brought this product couple of days back from Amazon, but from dayone I am facing a challenge of network loss because of which your phone says the number is switched off to other party without your knowledge. Afterthat you have to restart the phone and then again things start working fine. I have contacted the customer care as well, they have clear my cache and reset the network but unfortunately the problem remains the same to me. I would not recommend buying this product.

"
"

  Best performance in this price segment. Bought it on 11th June 2020 and till now no complaint in its usage.Fast charging and battery backup is good as expected.Sound quality is awesome. Using Sony wireless over the ear and one plus bullet wired earphones with it.Although i use my older mobile one plus 6T heavily for gaming and NETFLIX, i played few games on One Plus 8 and its super smooth.Go for it.

"
"

  Nothing to dislike in the phone. Built in Alexa is the highlight.Warp charging has improved from before, its really fast.Battery lasts a day easily even with continuous usage.Product was delivered on same day, thanks to Amazon sale. It was great deal indeed...!

"
"

  Literally this phone is outstanding,🔋 battery life is decent so far..Display quality and view is awesome phone build is lit  🔥High speed processing  with snapdragon 860👌Front camera is very blurry which is the main downside.Didn't not expected this from oneplus.Rear cam is just OK. I can't say it is the best.I hope oneplus may fix the camera issue in the coming updates.Apart from the camera this phone is killer. To be honest.

"
"

  Awesome mobile but sometimes I found hanging issues. Don't know whether it's real or not otherwise awesome phone. Go for it...Excellent fingerprint sensorBattery life is somehow poorCamera is awesome... Check some photos in 12 MP.Don't know why I am unavailable to zoom and full-screen in 48MP. If any solution guide me

"
"

  This is excellent mobile for this budget!Pros: Camera is ultimateBattery performance is awesomeDisplay is butter smooth both 60hz and 90hzFaster fingerprintOxyzen OS is ultimate with more featuresDesign gives is Premium lookWifi, bluetooth and connectivity are goodCons : no 3.5mm audio jackNo SDCard support, but OTG pendrive supprt is thereCould have included C type converter in BoxIf u have the budget just go for it!!!!!!

"
"

  There's very minimal need to speak anything about the phone as this has been reviewed by a large population over YouTube. But one thing I would like to highlight is about the camera. It could have been made better and most importantly could have provided the same camera set up as NORD.

"
"

  One plus is brilliant phone except two problems i have noticed so far.1. Phone automatically turns into silent mode though slider is in Ringer mode. Efforts to slide it up-down wll not help. Phone reboot is the only final option.2. Once location service is started manually or by any app.. It does not get Turned Off manually agin phone reboot is the only option.Experience with Oxygen OS is superb and nice phone hardware.

"
"

  Awesome 200/100 it's good now using amases me but I will write  riview aftre 50 days of my experience

"
"

  Pros:Good battery life, screen resolution, responsive fingerprint scanner,Cons:WiFi connectivity issues, slow apps loading, Alexa is poor to respond, Google assistant does not function properly

"
"

  Camera is 3rd graded and as poor as a 5/6K phone. Can't believe this is a 44K phone camera.Overall performance is ok. Batterry is ok as of now.Not a good buy. Better to purchane One Plus 7 pro. I have the same also and that is far more elegant in any aspect.

"
"

  Great

"
"

  The box was not tampered (seal was in place) but I felt things were a little unarranged inside the box. Like the ejection tool was lying somewhere inside the box and red cable card was not glued properly etc. All this was a little suspicious in the beginning but the phone was in good condition.

"
"

  great phone but little expensive. diappointed with camera quality. hope oneplus will improve with update.. if you have budget then go for it. i got 8gb ram variant at 39k including all bank offers

"
"

  This model is a total beast. 5 stars for battery life. Finger print reader does its job like a pro. The speakers of this model are awesome.  I must say the front camera could have been more better. The back camera is simply great auto focuses on object. And when it comes to the speed just no wonder it does play pubgg very smoothly with no lags. I have  8gb /128gb variant the ram of this model just boomm.... Just thankful. GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU ARE A FAN OF GAMING.

"
"

  Well it's OnePlus.1.Don't get your hopes up it's a decent phone with latest chipset.2.Good camera (could have been better at this price).3.Decent battery life last almost full day on single charge.4.Can be fully charged in hour or so thanks to 35w wrap charge.5.Should have provided with memory card slot.

"
"

  Coming from Samsung Galaxy Note 9, I would say that One Plus 8 is an overall excellent device. Very smooth touch, excellent hardware-software optimization. Never faced any issue in last 2 months or so. Extremely satisfied with it. It is second to none.

"
"

  My First OP Phone. Satisfied. Lightening Fast Performance. Good Camera. Speakers are Awesome. Charging Technology is Fantastic. Design and Build Quality is The Best. Value for Money. Go for It.Just got 1 problem..When I Bought Rs.900 3D Tempered Glass...And applied to the Screen...It Works Fine, Smooth But When at Night time I Try to Take Selfie by Screen Flash..Due to Punchhole Camera Design, Light is Reflected from Tempered Glass and It Creates Blue tinge on the Image... :/ Weird Problem...

"
"

  The overall phone has a great uplift compared to my existing Oneplus7.But when it comes to Camera quality it is the worst of all....Its good only for outdoor and bright light photos.Indoors photography is a big mess with lots of granulation and loss of sharpness.Nightscape was the major disappointment when oneplus was known for its camera quality.Front camera doesn't give the output of a 2mp camera.

"
"

  As a oneplus fan its fully disappointed. After playing 2 games of pubg phn is heating at very high level. Camera as not expected feels like op7t has much better camera performance.Heating issue:1) while gaming2) watching youtube for 15 minutes3) while in call for more tham 15 minutes4) while using camera also sometimes its showing error like phone is getting High temperature close the camera

"
"

  this is my second oneplus device and i have never been disappointed, got a great deal as well during the amazon sale purchased it for around 32000 which i feel is a great price for this phone the display is very good and also the new oxygen os is so good to look at overall a good phone for someone who wants a stylish looking phone but does not have  to sell his/her kidney to buy one,

"
"

  ""Display"" has some black flickering in low brightness. Overall product is good and smooth. Oneplus this time need to check quality control because my first order has severe display issue and with my replacement order when i opened box the pre applied screen protector is full of air bubbles and also small tiny scratch beside speaker grill i thought it is fine not much noticeable.

"
"

  Coming from Asus Zenfone 5z this feels like an amazing upgrade. The way Oxygen OS glides through your daily use is amazing. Given that I use camera very less, the quality for which I use it is worth it. Overall an amazing experience. Best thing about this phone is definitely the battery life. Gave me 7 and half hours of SOT with light gaming. 45k is definitely a little expensive, But if you could get it for exchange and some offer it definitely gives you bang for your buck.

"
"

  Buy this expensive phone and when try to share the Google MAP it cant be shared, when i checked the one plus forum this issue is faced by other people. didnt expect this kind of quality from this kind of price now please provide me alternative what to are we getting any new update to resolve this issue

"
"

  This phone is not recomenable 2 those who took selfies. A lot. Meanwhile back cameras are decent enough and gives a good performance. Battery backup nice. Warp charging charges 15-100% within a hour.

"
"

  I am using oneplus since oneplus 5T and i was very excited about oneplus 8 series. When I ordered the device I was not expecting too much, however when i get the delivery next day and the first impression was just wow. After using it now for a week i am giving this feedback. It is an awesome phone and i must say that there is no match in performance and display quality. It feels so premium in hand. Its a must go phone. Awesome battery backup.  Just loved this phone .

"
"

  I had an iPhone 7 before ,I snapped photos here and there never regretted,this phone is fast and smooth as one plus said but camera is not that great ,If you want a modern phone I would suggest this is it with 5g capability,I was confused between one plus Nord and this phone but it's a good way of marketing by them they want to sell both the phones by giving options to the customers ,Most people will go for Nord rest will go with this phone

"
"

  Spent 45K which is too expensive and facing finger print issues.And when we open Oneplus care app, it is showing your device is already registered. Means this may be returned device or refurbished. really hectic experience for premium amount we spent.

"
"

  Over all good Product. But few things not found as per written...No Product book/ No Sim card open PIN. And I expected one plus 8 written down in any places but I could not found in Handset...First purchase oneplus handset in my life.

"
"

  Overall a good phone.I bought this phone for its camera quality, thinking its the best of its kind.  But to be honest, I have seen better camera! I am not saying it produces bad pictures. Since my expectations were too high, I am disappointed to say this phone didn't reach up to it.Everything else about this phone is just awesome!All what they say about how fast these phones are are actually true.

"
"

  I just bought this one plus and recived it on Saturday. It worked perfectly but today (Monday) I encountered an issue with the camera. The rear camera in portrait mode was showing a totally green window. I blv something happened with camera lens. It shouldn't happen with a brand new one plus.

"
"

  Phone is amazing. Fingerprint is so fast that it just go straight in. I am bit disappointed with camera but it's okay. Battery life is great.With 90hz display it flow like butter, smooth and fast. And Amazon service was also very fast and secure. It totally worth it.

"
"

  Hi I have been using this for past 4 DaysWhat is GoodClassic look and BuildGood overall PerformanceCamera Good not ProfessionalExcellent DisplayFast DeliveryBacking FactorsHefty priceNo 3.5 JackNo full Screen Support Aps there is a black bar of 2mm on top Camera Punch.Recommended for those who do have 3 year old phone or more.

"
"

  One of the best designed phone ever. In general experience and in-hand feel is awesome (Better than 8 pro).Screen, performance, battery everything is on point except camera.If camera is not your priority, then go for it blindly and you won't regret it.

"
"

  This phone has amazing battery life ....it can go up to one and half day by using it casually..It's camera is not that much bad as it is told in all the YouTube videos....for a normal person who only take casual selfies and pics ...this phone is going to impress him a lot .

"
"

  I like everything about this phone, few things could have been better like screen refresh rate could have been 120hz,Instead of macro lens telephoto was better, It should also get a IP rating like the pro version.Price of One plus is increasing, earlier it was known as flagship killer now it turned into a flagship phone. Price are little high, it should come under 40K.Rest all is good.

"
"

  wow what a beautifull product I love one+ in the respective of one plus 85g I love this phone especially a notification feature whenever msg notification come the sider light of screen looks so beautifull over all camera quality not so impressive but ....ok okk  and phone look wooooah so amazing and speed oh Ghosh ।।। hahah

"
"

  Camera is OK... Big disappointment on its 2mp macro camera.. It's useless.. Front camera also ok type. Screen is absolutely amazing. Also processor works great. Speaker is spectacular. Speaker is really good. I must say.In short its not for those people whose camera is priority. Go for it if you r gamer or media consumer.

"
"

  This mobile is best under 50k.....I really loved Oxygen OS....But I aspected much better in cameras but this are also fine..Also if it contains wireless charging it was be the beast in flagship under 50k...Thanks.#NeverSettle...

"
"

  A rubbish device , Over heating at it's peak , don't buy this device from amazon coz they are not going to solve if anything wrong occurs , go for official stores like relience & croma ... Test the device before buying ... beware of Poor service by Amazon

"
"

  Finally a flagship device from OnePlus. This phone has that emersive experience that were missing in the previous models. Great camera and amazing sound quality. Cheers team OnePlus.

"
"

  I was using OnePlus 6 before this. Its amazing experience to use 90 hz screen and Snapdragon 865. Battery life is above the average. Camara can be better. At this price range from OnePlus i was expecting better camara quality. Oxygen OS makes the experience best. In hand experience is premium. Weight management of phone is perfect. Display is really amazing.my overall  experience is good with this phone.

"
"

  Network issue on reliance jio network, network will appear 100% but call/recieve not possible,same sim work fine on other phone, complaint to Jio and one plus customer care,one advise to do network reset,  I did that issue resolved for some days but this repeated issue , network settings change automatically and you will be wondering network is visible and you will not able to make calls

"
"

  Delivery took too long....I'm using OnePlus 6 for past 2yrs.... upgraded to OnePlus 8, writing review after using OnePlus 8 for 10days... Display and camera quality super..... performance is also super...In OnePlus 6 I have seen ph heat issue.... but OnePlus 8 I didn't see any heating issues.... battery backup good for now...

"
"

  The selfie camera sucks in low light. The software and the charging speed is amazing. But camera is bad. Full charge in 57 mins approx and lasts UpTo 13-14 hrs under normal use. If you are a camera freak, I recommend you to look elsewhere..

"
"

  I am unable to record videos on my oneplus 8. As you can see in the screenshot attached it is showing ""recording stopped due to an error"". Sadly I tested video recording on my phone after 10 days of purchase of my mobile so return was not possible. It feels sad after investing this amount of money and still you are not able to record video on your phone.

"
"

  Amazing phone . No real issues . Oneplus 8 is slightly behind oneplus8 pro in the camera dept,Only if you consider telephoto lens beneficial to you. Otherwise wide and ultrawide camera are great. Best thing is that video quality is as par with the most competitive products. Super Amoled display and loudspeaker are bliss.  Full marks to oneplus. 👌👌👌

"
"

  Good phone with a powerful processor and good camera.Pros:Lag free interactionNo heating issue even after long usage for gamingBatteryCameraCons:Fingerprint scanner. Slower than what it used to be on my OnePlus 6

"
"

  The best package you will get out of the box.Everything is a class for this One plus 8 look wise, Weight wise, and Performance wise.Looks classy...Slight slippery ,can't use without phone case. Slim size, curved look & 5 G tech will amaze you.

"
"

  Superfast performance! Great battery life! Fingerprint reader is also fast! Camera quality of video recording is excellent especially after the os update to ver.10.5.8 with HEVC codec that use 1/4th of the normal memory usage. Picture quality is also good. The only problem is not having a headphone jack. You have to rely on a bluetooth headset or use an adapter.

"
"

  Lots of software bug and not giving back pre book amount also. Lots of battery Drain and even working like heater also.

"
"

  Received the product after 4 days of order.. I bought this for my wife as a gift and she loved it...! Truly worth the emotion..!!

"
"

  Great battery life I am reviewing after 20 days camera performance in day light shot is too good gaming performance is excellent  heating issue is their when u will record with screen recorder while playing games like pubg display is awesome n I have black colour variant looks classy their is no touch issue in one plus 8 front camera is also good in day light shot

"
"

  OnePlus 8 got a pretty awesome configuration with the range , curve screen, fullhouse power and yes the performance.but with long day use the battery drain out quickly.however with over all performance end it's the best to use in.

"
"

  waste mobile that to this amazon waste fellows like these ceating products only they will sell if any problem 10 days replacment is there but they wont reply amazon customer persion will he will tell some story and he will left in hardware and software deatils he will not check only damage is there they returnsdont buy any mobile from amazon .

"
"

  With Snapdragon 865 it handles everything easily. The Amoled display is also beautiful. Indisplay fingerprint does work fine. Only one thing that I think is not flagship level is its camera. If your priority is camera then you might consider some other phone. Other than that I didn't find any cons in OnePlus 8. Just go for it.

"
"

  This is my first one plus phone and I am really happy with my decision of buying this master piece. Using it from last 2 days and I am in love with this phone. Bettery back, Camera quality, fingerprint reader everything is just Wow. Those who are planning to buy a phone in this budget should go for this blindly.

"
"

  This is my honest review battery life good display amazing you won’t regret go for it I have both iPhone XR and now one plus 8 but honestly one thing this is better than iPhone

"
"

  Sorry yesterday i requested replacement for this order due to some color setting problems,after that i visited one plus store and they had corrected some color setting in the phone now its replicate the right colors. i dont want to replace my product.Thanks for the service.

"
"

   Love this phone worth spending on money on this product .Speacial thanks to amzon team for their cooperation.Thanku amzon & oneplus .

"
"

  Speed is just seamlessly awesome.Battery drains faster and when it reaches 30% , phone's temperature rises.Camera is really disappointing,it Just not justify 48mp at all.Speakers are best,truly Dolby Atmos.Initiated a return as I was told that camera problem was genuine that I faced.

"
"

  Not happy with front camera. Also miss 3.5 mm jack badly. Bluetooth earphone not working well with few apps like teams. Also I have memory card with MP3 don't know what to do with it now. Display, Back camera, Battery all are fine happy with those. Phone is bit hot while charging. No heat issues on gaming. Feel good while gaming.

"
"

  All in one package ..... it's the first time when I switched to one plus phone....and it really meets my all expectations....picture quality is just awesome...battery backup runs for almost all day....Last but not the least pubg gameplay is super smooth and graphic quality is awesome...just in love with this phone...

"
"

  Display : 9/10Camera : 7/10Battery : 9/10Speed : 9/10Design : 9/10U I : 9/10Hand reachability : 8/10Fingerprint scanner : 8/10Previously used mobile  - Google pixel 2

"
"

  The Phone doesn't meet your expectations, The Camera is Nothing like a Previous Versions of OnePlus . Battery Life is ok ok.. Finger Print sensor is slower than older versions!Don't buy Chinese products.

"
"

  The camera quality is very poor.May be some manufacturing fault with my phone's camera

"
"

  I have been using this since 4 days now,BATTERY LIFE: Is goodCAMERA: Quality of the pictures in night mode are really good.Configuration of the phone is amazing, just liked how touch sensitive it is and how fast it interacts between applications.. Overall It's worth the buy.

"
"

  The overall product is best for the budget it offers.But there's a heating issue when playing high graphic games for longer duration.But impressive when handles large numbers of apps running in background.

"
"

  Phone is good...But it's looking like my samsung s9 plus...However...A good quality phone is in front of you..Grab it soon...But don't expect too much....

"
"

  Hi teamI'm facing issue on down speaker on my one pluse 8.. it's not working at all .  I'm managing with above one... Could not able to find .is that tech issue or is there any option to switch on....plz help me one pluse team... It's been just month back I bought...

"
"

  Overall great phone but keeps rebooting..And also has some weird distortion on screen which is very small but annoyingIts very fast and great phone but the above two issues are kill the experience

"
"

  Amazing camera , unbelievable display, super sound clarity. I am upgraded from Moto G5 S plus. So this the best phone i ever used in my life.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is awesome none of the phone can match its speed.Battery life : I am getting 9hrs charge onscreen while continous usage (Full charge time is taking less than 45min)Camera quality : Awesome on daylight and Night time 🤩🤩But on low light its not that good.

"
"

  I will write the pros and cons onlyPros1.superb display2.premium feel3.form factor is the best4.oneplus means performance (Snapdragon 865)5.fast chargingNOWCONS1.Camera: camera is downgraded from its predecessor and the only con which I found.Overall superb

"
"

  I was an IPhone user. Comparing one Plus 8 with iPhone, I like battery life. It stays for very long and battery life is superb.Camera quality is also fine.Fingerprint is comparatively slow if compared with iPhone. Otherwise it's really good phone and worth the price.. Happy to buy this 😊😊

  'no need to buy this'its have many display issues when using this phone  3 days i found the issue which is on display with low brightness when the invert display option is onon that condition after unlocking the phone using face cam the display suddenly brightess up and unlock as normal .

"
"

  After a month of use I could only find fault in the OnePlus sometimes the internet won't work and sometimes calls doesn't work and sometimes the touch doesn't work I had restart the damn phone. Either they need to get their updates right . I would suggest some other brand please don't buy this phone.

"
"

  While coming to mobile everything is awesome 👌👌👌. I'll give 5* to mobile and features. But the person who kept the screen guard is not nice, he kept the screen guard slight upward because of this my front cam is cover partially. I want replacement for my screen guard. Please do it ASAP.

  One Word Review - You Can't find Any Alternative At This PricePerformance is so goodCamera is Ok not badOxygen OS is so SmoothAnd Display is awesome with little curve there is no accidental touch perfect curved display for a phoneYou would love this after you buy

"
"

  The best phone of 2nd quarter in 2020 . The phone has excellent built quality and the finish is really awesome. The total premium feel in the hands . The specs are the best the camera quality is very good and the performance is very smooth and very much comfortable for use. The best phone I have ever used.

"
"

  There's serious issue on amazon app. When you purchase it using no cost emi with one or more products, it gives you no cost emi option. But later it don't go through the bank and Amazon doesn't take 1% responsibility. Also this phone has a very bad performance with the front facing camera.

"
"

  Can't find the design worth of money. Performance and rest are really good. Camera quality is good,price is little high didn't expect such price from OP as they are not know for high range phones.

"
"

  I just loved this phone. Earlier I had OP7 and now upgraded to this beast. It's just worth for money. The camera is just awesome especially after the update. And the smoothness!! Ufff!! Can't describe that. Just go for it.

"
"

  Everything is amazing about this device the only issue i would say sometimes is it heats up to 42 degrees  when playing pubg but  not that often  depends  on your room temperature too but over all camera  battery life and display really is impressive ..

"
"

  Its perfect , size and weight is very perfect, its very handy.It is the best phone available in market with this price range with all these fantastic features.

"
"

  The oneplus 8 received is having a severe battery draining issue. I have to charge the device twice a day. With less thane 2hrs of screen usage the battery reached 58%.

"
"

  Phone looks good and performance wise also good....but phone is getting heated while using long duration. Camera is not that much expected..... battery is also getting drained fast, before I was using OnePlus 5 battery was good I have used OnePlus 5 for 3 years without faced any issue.

"
"

  Apart from all good, here are few issues/bug I am facing.1. The call disconnect frequently2. Your phone goes in not reachable mode3. Camera settings resets automatically4. Phone gets heated up upon opening few apps

"
"

  OnePlus prebook offer cashback not credited post 30 days

"
"

  Everything is perfect only camera quality is average..may be with software update it will get fix.. i find no display issue and sound quality is extremely superb.its so loud that back panel of the phone gets vibrate..

"
"

  Value for money product ♥️... Snapdragon 865 and fnatic mode in this mobile is just awesome... Camera is average but u get many modes... Display is so good... If you are looking for a gaming and casual using phone just go for this... This is best product RN under 45k rs

"
"

  Camera is good. Oxygen OS is smooth. No bloatwares. Amoled screen is superb as always. Not sure how 5G will work on the phone though.

"
"

  The delivered device is defective, as there is a constant red-pink line on the camera side.  It is strange to note that the shipping box is completely fine but the device is damaged.

"
"

  Just amazing...

"
"

  I was a OnePlus user since long.. buying OnePlus 8 was a big deal for me.1st week was good.But later on finger print sensor started lagging.Used for another week and this phone started to reboot itself.. sometimes thrice in a row.

"
"

  Didn't get the charger with the phn. And some times fingerprint scanner doesn't work properlyWorst product ever. Don't purchase this product. Worst amazon service. Worst finger print reader worst camera. Battery life is also bad.

"
"

  Go for it if you are power hungry user for camera enthusiasts look for something else in that range.SD 865 is buttery smooth even in pubg HDR extreme mode. Awesome display and body.

"
"

  Not user friendly

"
"

  Phone is..Just a awesome....but..""Delivery"".. courier is very slow..chutiya

"
"

  As I have upgraded my phone from oneplus7 to OnePlus , so loved onepluse phone. Though not happy with camera performance..

  Camera was handsomeOru rakshem illa...poli saaanamBattery charging speed was very goodBut battery power is little low.i think it's reason refresh rate 90hz

"
"

  I'm loving it. Everything is perfect, I was planning to buy OnePlus 7t but I upgrade my budget & switched to OnePlus 8 & m totally Happy & Satisfied. I wish I could buy OnePlus 8pro. If this phone is this kind of marvelous then how OnePlus 8 pro would be?  I give 100/100

"
"

  Good point about this phone is display but camera quality is not looking like a flagship phone . 30k Nord is has better camera than  45k one plus 8 . Take a look of colours before and after clicking picture. It gives faded colours Colours in 2x zoom and very bad in gallery.

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very fast , battery life is up to 15 -16  (play 3-4 game of pubg) and the camera quality is giving us a next level of picture.  its awesome .. no one can beat one plus 8 nowadays...

"
"

  Phone is heating even though not playing games.Not satisfied with camera quality.Good video recording.Good gestures.Good AMOLED 90 hz display.

"
"

  1. Battery life - very good2. Camera quality - excellent3. Fingerprint reader- superbOverall one plus 8 - mind-blowing...👍💯

"
"

  Camera quality should be good according to this deviceThe photos are not so realistic. It comes very artificial and pixels breaks to early when we zoom the picture.At last, need to improve in the camera. It is the only thing making it less flagship.

"
"

  Face unlock is giving problems like unlocking the phone from any other face than the owner ...shock to see such quality from one plus..need a solution as early as possible

"
"

  Everything is good except camera. At this price point this camera is worst. They have given camera update to global versions. But not indian version. One Plus treating indian customers badly. Its screen vibrates when we play anything in speakers.

"
"

  Camera quality is average.... and after installation UV glue tempered glass front camera is blur because no any option in market any tempered glass

"
"

  The charging cable broke within 1 month of uses even after handling it the atmost care.  Expected quality accessories from a flagship smartphone like this.

"
"

  First time i am using one plus phone,overall nice phone charging time less battery backup good enough.application opening time very less thanks to Snapdragon 865 processor..overall 4.8 out of 5.

"
"

  Fully satisfied with OnePlus 8.Super build quality and performance are awsome.Value for money if  you  plan to use this mobile at least next 3 year.No hang and performance issue.

"
"

  Camera is great but 48MP of one plus is still not as sharp as 12 MP of Iphone. Battery is nit as great as is claimed to be but still good. Has great features and an unbeatable processing speed. Would definitely recommend buying it.

"
"

  Video quality of Netflix is very poor. This is a mediocre Chinese phone which is hyped. U m a genuine buyer. U shud consider other alternatives like vivo and Samsung etc. At dis price point, iPhone is d best.

"
"

  Camera is just OK when compared to 8 pro..while I try to upgrade to OnePlus 8 pro, Amazon is just giving replace offer on OnePlus 8 not upgrade which is very disappointing..I feel it is better to buy such high cost electronics in brand authorised shops

"
"

  Front camera sucks during low light for photos and face unlock and all other cameras sucks during low light. I feel cheated for 45k. I hope they roll out update for this. 7t is better for sure. Disgusting for OnePlus to cheat us

"
"

  This is the first time I've brought high specs phone and I'm happy that I made the right choice. Awesome display, good battery life (easily last for 24 hrs), excellent camera & filters, super smooth & properly implemented RAM optimization.

"
"

  My brother just unlocked my phone(Oneplus 8) with face id. We are not either identical twins nor he looks like me .He is 5 years younger than me . How is it possible. How can he do so ? What the hell  security does oneplus give.

"
"

  This device is the best I have purchased till date.Camera is👍Network connectivity is 👍Battery is average. Can run for a day!Bit costly considering the competition but value for money considering the features available.Go for it😁

"
"

   Phone is awesome...camera and battery, screen is too good...but in box they are not provide headphones...and we r not able to connect wired headphone to this device only wireless headphones are connected..

"
"

  Mobile is good but the delivery of the mobile is horrible. When i placed the order it shows the same day delivery but it deliverd to me after two days that to be so many follow up with the customer care.

"
"

  Sleek and sexy design.I was really excited for this phone and researched a lot before buying this and it was worth it.Its the kind of phone that can not go out of style even after 4 years.Think about it as a good investment and go for it.

"
"

  Good phone, love to use OnePlus phones started to use from OnePlus 3 - OnePlus 8 really happy and OnePlus products are good.. and I got the phone during the 1st sale itself....but delivery was too late...

"
"

  Camera is of awesome quality..The indisplay fingerprint works perfectly..Battery back up is ok as the display consumes to much power..But vooc charger is awesome and charges the phone very fast...Very happy .

"
"

  One plus 8 is an awesome phone, thank you Amazon and I thank the seller as well.

"
"

  Phone is so good,fingerprint reader is too fast,camera quality is also good first photo i posted is from 12mp camera with 1x zoom of one plus 8 and second photo with 48mp camera and third photo from super micro camera.i love this smartphone. thank you

"
"

  I have been using this device from 21may I don't know why but I found lagg issue with this smartphone while surfing I found my device stuck seriously disappointing and talking about camera is not price worthy where as sound and screen is remarkable

"
"

  I have installed very few apps and it's the 128 GH version. It hangs randomly when I haven't even installed any games or heavy usage apps. I would srsly suggest people to buy iPhoneSe 2020 as it won't hang like this does and is in same price range.

"
"

  It's very good build quality solid battery life superb performance and software camera was most impressive and edze display was to good

"
"

  Phone is very good but my C cable was missing in my box

"
"

  Best product by OnePlus, battery life is so good,best display quality.value for money.no compromise in performance.overall great product.Thanks Amazon for very fast delivery.

"
"

  Camera Quality is not upto the mark not at all worthy to spend 45k for op8 oneplus 7t is a much better option instead of this failure really very bad camera quality compare to the price my fathers m31s camera is better than this one

"
"

  best phone of 2020best camera

"
"

  Ohh it's just awesome feel to have one plus 8It's looking good 👌 and smoothness was to good just love it 😍

"
"

  I have had used many phones in the past but I've never come such phone. One thing everyone will love about this phone is battery life and if you add up OnePlus wireless bullets z then you can't stay away from your phone.

"
"

  Front camera quality in low light conditions or during video calls are just terrible, don't know whether they will fix it with update or not. As of now I am regretting my decision. Rather than camera everything is fine.

"
"

  This the best buy in mobiles till date. It justifies the price with the display and sound. I do not use camera much but there is a big gap between my clicks and other cheap phones clicks.

"
"

  Heating issue is there in phone & it is also getting hang whenever I do constant typing for more than 5 minutes infact talked Amazon customer care but received no positive response from there side no satisfied with the performance.

"
"

  I have received a defective prodct from amzon. After few days of my purchase there came a white beias line on display!!!!!!!!! And Amazon is nt taking it as return and one plus store is nt replacing it!!!

"
"

  Got my first ever flagship specs phone after a long time, camera is amazing and haptic vibration is just awesome, full on satisfied with display quality, in hand feeling is excellent, overall a good package

"
"

  very well designed phone, feels very premium and comfortable in hand . Processor performance is superb and display quality is excellent.

"
"

  Do not buy any product on EMI from Amazon.. I have ordered product worth rs 42k and paying monthly EMI for amount 46k... First they told us no cost EMI but EMI amount includes interest +principal +GST.

"
"

  It is an amazing fast phone , loved the battery life gives you all day of battery life in 30-40 mins of charging. Super smooth & extremely light in weight. Overall best phone. Thanks OnePlus.

"
"

  Battery poor quality, mobile get hang when connect with wireless casting.. never seen with my old One plus 5 T.Pls buy carefully

"
"

  Amazing Phone. Worth the money. Camera can be improved by oneplus somehow on all devices. This is the one place only where they need improvements. Night camera quality is a bit off.

"
"

  I'm abit more surprises when i saw this phone on reality it's a amazing phone and I'm impressed. The phone is reasonable in spending it. I can say that overall its a good phone. This is my first experience in using OnePlus phone. 👍🏻

"
"

  Just got a new phone phoneNot at all happy with experiencePhone is lagging ,all screen goes blank sometimes the sound does not come.Very poor experience ,

"
"

  All the feature is pretty cool but I personally I feel the fingerprint sensor of the mobile sometimes doesn't respond and not able to recognize...rest all the thing I found smooth and fastest experience aver in my life

"
"

  Very good smart phone. camera is good. Performance is excellent m

"
"

  Portrait mode sucks.. completely showing different fade on facecolor..front camera has no full view.. give some better updated for cameras... Even 7 series camera are performing better

"
"

  Excellent.Super .Awesome..... Everything is super in One plus 8. Compare to one plus 7t and 7 pro .. 8 is very best.charging is awesome.fingerprint is very fast. Camera is also good.I like this one plus 8 mobile.

"
"

  Perfect balance of flagship specs!Fingerprint - reliable and fast enoughBattery life - easy 8 hrs with normal usage at 90hz (91% to 26%)Camera quality - not the best, requires other camera apps

"
"

  Till now not completed one month but faced a problem. Fingerprint reader very worse...Don't know why it's happened but can't expected. Better to avoid and buy new and low cost phonesThat's very good for many

"
"

  Best flagship phone!!!! In love with it's camera!!!

"
"

  ProsAmazing displaySuper sound qualityDecent camerasGood Design and handyConsLow light photographyLittle bit slow fingerprint readerOverall worth for 45k🤑

"
"

  i am not really into cameras and dont really care...rest of the stuff is top tier...made in china cannot be the sole reason to hate  something...its treat to use like always was.

"
"

  Please don't purchase this product, within one month my mobile got switched off suddenly and not working. Due to 10 days over service centre not showing interest for replacement.

"
"

  I bought this product 2 months ago. The performance and camera quality all are good but the body both side panel color sticker is removing.Please check my attached photos.

"
"

  Awesome phone....SD865 like a beast💙💙💙💙..camera quality is avarage.... fingerprint is awesome..very fast and reliable.. battery performance is avarage..... build quality of this phone very good.......

"
"

  Mobile is not worth for money, the screen going blank and flicker whenever u search in google or.maps. I tried for product service there is no option for the same. It would be great help if I get a refund

"
"

  I would recommend this phone to anyone who doen not have camera as it's first priority.camera is quite disappointing but still it is managable.else there is nothing to complain about this phone.I would say go for it

"
"

  JUST GO FOR IT WITHOUT ANY SECOND THOUGHTS. I AM LOVING IT AMAXING PRODUCT WHAT A PROCESSOR WHAT A PERFORMANCE . JUST GO FOR IT YOU WILL FEEL THE PHONE WHEN YOU FIRST TIME HOLD IT . ITS TRUALLY FLAGSHIP.

"
"

  Overall it is the best smartphone in the market right now. It's everything I was hoping for and more. Fingerprint scanner could have been faster. Other than that, amazing performance.

"
"

  value for money product everything is good but battery is not up to the mark but yes it is killer as compare to iphone xr

"
"

  i received oneplus 8 yesterday in amazon camera was excellent but i cant do the aspect ratio is not working full its working only 4:3 aspect ratio and back camera 48 also aspect ratio is4:3 ..full ratio not working

"
"

  Pros: Battery good,sleek, screen is good... finger print reader good, camera looks good....cons: for this kind of mobile needs wireless charger,120 htz display, ip 65.

"
"

  The battery is draining so fast. It is taking more than 30 minutes to get 50% charging. As they promised to provide 50% charging in 22 minutes is not true. Everything is cool except for the battery.

"
"

  Camera quality amazing and performance is impressive, if you are looking for a premium phone then definitely this can be a good choice you can opt for.

"
"

  It's a very good phoneAwsome look , Good quality, camera is very goodEverything is good.But Im giving 4 stars because there is no built-in Alexa in OnePlus 8 phoneVery disappointed ☹️☹️

"
"

  Wonderful device, one plus needs no further mentioning. Camera, interface, touch everything is superb.

"
"

  Nice phone

"
"

  Ithi o these mobile should be cost of 43000 but ihave been got these mobile 43000 via sbi credit card mobile smothly feeling ihave been used samsung galaxy s20plus buy only one plus 8 not go for one plus 8pro

"
"

  This product heats too much when you Play any heavy game e.g. PUBG, COD e.t.c.If you use this smartphone in AC room then It will cool otherwise this smartphone is waste for gaming.

"
"

  Slider button has an issue not working sometimes and camera is also not upto the mark in this price

"
"

  Really good. Slightly costly but I am loving it.

"
"

  I have got defective mobile, phone has hanging problem, touch is not at all good and I am facing voice problem also

"
"

  Speed 🔥 Design 😍 Performance 💪🏻 = OnePlus 8 😎#MustBuy

"
"

  I am using from past 10 days and looks very good.I will recommend OnePlus to give a screeen cover also additionally.

"
"

  Product is good ....but the invoice/recepit sent by the seller is not clearly readable...therefore the same may be sent atleast by email @ krammohan2000@yahoo.com or any other mode

"
"

  The front camera quality is not good.The Mi note series worth 15000 rs front camera quality is better than this....

"
"

  The battery it not at all good as mentioned in the specification. It is dring faster.

"
"

  Front camera is not very good and some heating issues during charging but overall this phone is a beast

"
"

  Performance wise its top notch.but according to the price camera performance is good not great..

"
"

  Awsm mobile if you are new on oneplus then you will enjoy the features that oneplus 8 given ...i just luved this mobile thank you amazon for delivering the product and for this mobile

"
"

  I love the phone but heating issues 37 degree centigrade while turn on 4g after 20 minutes while using YouTube or internet :(

"
"

  Within 1 month it's start with switching off problems , it's automatically get switched off and whole day it's be like dead body, idont know this happens with my device or other also

"
"

  there is some issues with the display.. the punchhole black thing is missplaced and it look weired...

"
"

  Worth it for battery life.....then camera quality much more improved compare with 7 series....Handling - Oneplus really impressed .....

"
"

   Wireless charger of oneplus isnot working , battery showing red sign

"
"

  Superb performance, fabulous back camara quality, good battery life and Smoothing.But need to be improve front camara quality in my opinion.

"
"

  Front cam is of very bad quality. Even my redmi phone camera is giving better performance.

"
"

  Battery drains quickly, should work all day in normal usage, but lasts for 8 hrs

"
"

  All Total osm phn .in hand fillings just wow.super comfortable in hand . Snp dr 865 loved it .

"
"

  Camera quality is not upto the mark....as this price range......the camera is not better than oneplus 7t....and the edge is also not good...better there no edge on this phone....

"
"

  Good product 🥰

"
"

  Phone is amazing but don't buy with sbi offer with emi they are charging that 2000 in the form of gst for the transaction. If you want to buy with discount go with full payment.

"
"

  After recent update of Oxygen 11 on my OP8 the battery seems to drain a lot . The Fingerprint reader is accurate & camera quality is awsome.

"
"

  My 1st OnePlus Device,  It's Been 30 Days from the Purchase.. Working Smoothly.,No Heat Issues, only Drawback is 2MP camera from Back is Absolutely A ""Crap""

"
"

  Since I have upgraded from realme 3 pro . It's a huge difference in performance . Battery life is great. Camera is good . Overall device is great .Oxygen OS is the best

"
"

  Phone is slippery, needs a case.Front camera is below par, very grainyFringerprint sensor is slowOnly the pro version has cooling.

"
"

  Its review after use one week the phone was ossam nice quietly looking so sexy over all phone was paisa vasul ....i am love wid one plus 8 thank u Amazon shipping on a lock down period

"
"

  Jus go for it

"
"

  This is my first OnePlus device and I'm really happy about the performance, camera and battery life.I've bought Onyx black color and it's stunning!!

"
"

  OnePlus 8 looks amazing and stylish. If continue use the Battery life is 8 hrs only and fast charging. Cemera is  Crystal clear and superb  . Front cemera is normal.

"
"

  Nice phone butter smooth

"
"

  Sometimes it is strucking. At that time why the hell I purchased these Mobile thought is comming.. Now while writing review also it strucked for seconds..n no reponse from any one.

"
"

  Very good buildup.

"
"

  Likes :- everythingDislikes :- camera performance, zen mode limitations and night light

"
"

  It is a powerful phone. Oxygen os is smooth and can run multiple apps with breeze. Only issue is that camera isn't great. Screen is good and sound is also good.

"
"

  This phone display is not good having issue regards green tint and red tint and battery get very heat while playing pubg i think this time one plus is disappointed us very much.

"
"

  screen guard peeled off quickly .no indication while charging.adaptive brightness is very bad and not sensitive.

"
"

  Over all it is an excellent phone but needs improvement in battery life and camera quality. If we are paying 45k for this phone then definately we want all best things.

"
"

  Awesome Phone

"
"

  Overall performance is good.A bit disappointing with front cam.

"
"

  The product is highly hyped one with no real quality. phone gets heated up. charging speed is not as claimed in the spec. sound quality is also very pathetic.

"
"

  Best quality product provided by oneplus as compared to prize. Im impressed with theWrap charger. Only thing is optical camera is missing.otherwise is goodbuy product.

"
"

  Fabulous

"
"

  My phone is not at all working properly .. dialler shutting down ..screen just hot stuck...not able to use apps properly..need a resolution as soon as possible

"
"

  Top notch display with 90hz refresh rate.But they could have provided 256gb for this price instead of 128gb.

"
"

  I have purchased oneplus 8  3 months ago but after two months my phone camera is not open and after three months phone is not on and service center are not responding

"
"

  Buy this phone nowIt's a good product

"
"

  Excellent phone,,,,,,,but accesses are not available anywhereLike back cover/panelLike tempered glass screen

"
"

  Gyro sensor (accelerometer) not working properlyDisappointed...

"
"

  One plus should focus more on built in  Apps which should have AI, Voice enabled functionality

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Display , Camera, Charging, Fingerprint , Face unlock and specially Oxygen UI are best feutures of this phone... It's perfectly made for youth.

"
"

  I am having trouble in OnePlus 8,1_Phone speed slowed down,(phone performance & network issue)2_heating problem ....(When i am charging )

"
"

  Updates have fixed most of the initial issues.Decent phone to own!

"
"

  Overall good phone

"
"

  Mobile came without tempered glass as promised by amazon. The mobile didn't have a tempered glass on it. It said it is pre-applied, the mobile had nothing. Shame on Amazon

"
"

  OnePlus 8 5G having better fingers print reader, battery life is to be watched for some time from now. Camera quality is appears to be great.

"
"

  Product is good up to the satisfaction...but we are regretting that we have purchased a Chinese product; looking at the current clash.

"
"

  Overall experience is very good.. but camera needs a lot of improvement. I hope oneplus rolls out an update for the camera at the earliest.. the display is awesome..

"
"

  Didn't like the product at this price point

"
"

  Worst Experience Guys... Bought one plus 8 on Tuesday.. Touch screen is not working today..Don't buy this cheap mobile from Amazon Guys

"
"

  Wonderful product! Awesome sound quality.. ultimate touch and feel..smooth gaming and fingerprint scanner is damn fast..all this with a very good camera. :)

"
"

  The prebooking 1000rs  cashback offer is a big scam. Every time the customer service agent tell me to wait for a few days and later tell me I'm not eligible

"
"

  I have only one complain phone's screen goes on during long calls. Other wise best phone in this budget.

"
"

  worst

"
"

  Like it.

"
"

  Selfie camera worst than my oneplus5. If u want just google, OnePlus 8 selfie camera bad.....

"
"

  Not upto the price 45000Oneplus nord is faster and camera is also better in 30000 phone as compared to 45000I want a replacement

"
"

  Fingerprint,battery life and camera quality is excellent.but many more times I am facing hanging issue...and poor touch frequency or sensitivity

"
"

  Totally beast in performance.60 fps throughout each settings of high end games. 90 hz display op.best for it's all competition.

"
"

  Network is not stable we need to restart phone for every 10 minutes

"
"

  Nice phone with excellent quality. Highly recommended, good value for money...

"
"

  Yeh phone nhi Brand h brand😜A fantastic 5gphone  value for money  I'm luving it😘

"
"

  Love it .... Muaah always a OnePlus buyers this is my 3rd phone still same very good performance

"
"

  This phone is quite good and fast as i expected. Back cover with this not wrothy. Otherwise all ok..

"
"

   The camera and the OS is so good. Most stable OS i have ever used.

"
"

  Powerful phone just go for it

"
"

  My fingerprint sensor is murmering my fingers is not receive

"
"

  Best performance but colour saturation is very poor need to be improved hope oneplus will solve this issue ASAP.

"
"

  Overheating issue and less battery

"
"

  Simply awsme worth it. Everything is just next level.

"
"

  It's a power house phone. Not a feature rich one. Great for gaming performance.

"
"

  Best mobile in dis price range. .processor-camera-look overall in compare of Samsung go for it and I also order oneplus 8 pro

"
"

  Display is good but should have 1440p resolutionOverall it's an excellent device should go  for it if you don't care for higher  resolution

"
"

  Worst battery life 5min browsing it will drain 2% battery.

"
"

  Best phone true flagship

"
"

  Great phone with great slim curved design, good battery life, lovely display,nice camera.Overall a worth buy.

"
"

  Front cam quality cloud be better

"
"

  One plus 8 5 G 8 Gb ram 128.is a good phone .nice and slim look..fast .battery is good.display is good..camera need to be improved..over all good phonem

"
"

  Just a hype not that great phone to use...

"
"

  Great phone specially for gamers...Warp charging is too quick to get charge.

"
"

  Overall best phone in this price

"
"

  Awesome product from OnePlus ..But disappointed with the delivery time .it took nearly one week to deliver.But the service was good

"
"

  Overall it's perfect only front camera is not premium it's look like a normal low quality camera.

"
"

  Loved the curved screen and it is very smooth. decent camera with more stablization given for video. battery lasts for the full day with moderate usage

"
"

  Worth spending your precious money on this masterpiece.

"
"

  Loved it

"
"

  I got a faulty handset only realize when return date was over.it looks like software issue as many times it hangs and screen icons disappear.

"
"

  i m regular one plus user for me it is good

"
"

  Good camera,  smooth display. Everything's works really well. Hand free Alexa need some updates. Other than that good buy

"
"

  Speed that never settle...Camera features,autofocus is impossible quality...It's a flag ship edition of one plus..i just love it

"
"

  Not as expected..very disappointed with OnePlus 8

"
"

  Fingerprint is really fast. Battery life is easily lasting for 24 hr. Camera quality is really awesome.

"
"

  I'm using it from last one month. I had great experience with this phone. Problems what I was facing in last update all bugs shorted out.

"
"

  Excellent battery life and one of the best mobile for Gaming and Rough usage ..Its is the fastest phone I have ever seen😍

  One of the best phones I have ever used. Kudos to Amazon to make it available even in the times of pandemic.

"
"

  Performance is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is too good. overall first class 🙌

"
"

  Very good phone

"
"

  Amazing phone very smooth and attractive mobile camera and screen display touch also nice and amazing battery life and wrap charging

"
"

  Mind blowing one.

"
"

  Great phone to use very fast and smooth worth the buy.

"
"

  Nice phone with all required featues and android10 is cherry on the cake..

"
"

  Decent specs & performance but not value for money, 45k is too much

"
"

  Battery is worst in one plus 8 ever I used..

"
"

   Facing display issue. While browsing in Google the display will blinking continuesly.

"
"

  Overall good...

"
"

  Excellent phone with good battery backup..I switched from iPhone to android..and not felt any difficulty

"
"

  Close ur eyes and go for It. Worth the money

"
"

"

  Front camera is blur. and even slow mo also.

"

"
"

  I think I hate curved screen. Too many wrong taps and unable to peform back gesture smoothly.

"
"

"
"

  Front camera is not good not worth to money

"
"

  One of the best oneplus device ever loving itAnd delivery was on time fast and secure thank you amazon.in

"
"

  Camera not as good as Expected

"
"

  It's a beautiful phone.... That's all I can say

"
"

  Osm experience with ONEPLUS Love it🤩🤩🤩#NEVER SETTLE

"
"

  Performance is outstanding .very smooth in use but camera could be little better because I see a fake blur in portrait mode

"
"

  Wow such a beautiful product from oneplus. Excellent display. Battery life is much better. Camera is good except macro. I liked it.

"

  This is a great phone. It's super fast. The camera is good and it has a very good interface.  Overall a great phone

  Extraordinary display and speed.Camera and Battery charging superb.Great feeling to own a one plus product

"
"

  My phone it getting hot while playing pubg. Is there anyway to replace it. Apart from the heating problem this phone is lit

"
"

  Best phone under this price range

"
"

  Excellent mobile

"
"

  This is a super performing device.Note: no 3.5 mm jack, so while buying, get a type C to3.5 mm adaptor as well.

"
"

  I like most of the things in OnePlus, but the camera could be better, may be futurw updates will improve it.

"
"

  Nice one. Worth it at its cost. Everything is good but i still didn't experience the wifi 6. Its been 2 days from purchase

"
"

  OnePlus is Only Compare OnePlus mobile phone not compare other Android smart phones..latest n best smartphone ever

"

  Flagship performance

"

  Good fingerprint,good battery life,good camera quality,good Amazon service,I m full satisfied

"
"

  Chinese phone... sound quality is too bad

"
"

  The phone is awesome.Loved the camera,the battery life, display.The 90hz display is mind blowing.In hand feel🤩

"
"

  Performance look technology excellent. It could be more better if bullet wirless z headset provided by OnePlus.

"
"

  Awesome.

"
"

  If you are looking for a phone with the better processor and battery then go for one plus 8

"
"

  Onplus 8 is best ever launching by OnePlus. I am enjoying this one after oneplus 6t

"
"

  Poor quality phone Waste of money

"
"

  It's an okay phone but at the budget it is at the features does not meet my expectations

"
"

  Good ....have concern regarding one + 6 JBL Headphones are not supporting

"
"

  This phone made my switch from iphone to android not so difficult

"
"

  Best displayAwesome lookBut the selfie camera not worked for full (aspect area)Handy phone

"
"

  Still cant beat 6T

"
"

  Everything is good but front camera quality is not up to the mark as compared to one plus 7 pro

"
"

  Front camera not working full screen back camera no clarity OnePlus 8 fake handset not purchase

"
"

  Battery performance not good

"
"

  You just can't use any other phone if you use the OnePlus, Best one for the price - overall A+

"
"

  Awesome !! Oneplus Always !

"
"

  Camera is Just below average..even below 20k u can get better camera........... except camera...phone is awesome

"
"

  Overall a very good and powerful phone but sometimes phone get heat up even during the normal calls.

"
"

  Very good product... really amazing features, smooth display, good camera and video... such a fabulous phone....

"
"

  nice phoneBright displayAwesome cameraAwesome UIJust a good package

"
"

  One Plus 8 is 9 rating out of 10...Excellent Purchase...Loved it...Thanks Amazon and One Plus

"
"

  One  of the slim and sexy phones of oneplus.... Smooth to use

"
"

  Nice device. But camera not so good. Service from OnePlus is very poor.  Faltu hai.

"
"

  HelloI need a replacement as my phone is getting heated .It's been just 15 days since I've bought this.

"
"

  Buy this for the screen quality, performance, and bloatware-free Oxygen OS

"
"

  Front facing camera is not as good as other OnePlus devices

"
"

  Camera is flickering and slow motion is not good battery cahrging is not so fast .

"
"

  Nice productbattery also superOne plus 8 value for moneyCamera also nice

"
"

  Everything is fine, but camera is bit not up to the Mark,what you expect from a phone of this range.

"
"

  wonderful item... life is smooth. Awesome camera, photography. Just have n enjoy.

"
"

  I like each & everything about this phone but there is some issue with the cemra .The cemra is not soo good.

"
"

  Poor quality of  productPhoto clarity is much more poor and is shearwastage of money

"
"

  One plus is here to dominate.

"
"

  All the features are Good...except camera should have improved more in camera picture quality at this price

"
"

  Master 2020

"
"

  Batery backup does not prove 4300mAh. Rest is very nice.

"
"

  Nice mobile loved with experience oneplus 8 🥰😘🔥Never settle @ agowrishankar13@gmail.com

"
"

  It's a worth the money phone but if you are into more camera and photography then switch to 8pro

"
"

  Nice product.But you should include wireless charging specifications at this cost

"
"

  Sound quality is best. Battery backup very very  bad quality. Camera quality very poor.

"
"

  Less weight compares to other mobilesProcessing speed awesomeOnePlus always a king

"
"

  Very nice futures

"
"

  Everything is fine,, only One Plus Can give such a powerful Phone....

"
"

  Everything thing is good but camera quality is not great as compare to price.

"
"

  It's is somewhat overheating while charging...otherwise a top-class flagship product!

"
"

  Adaptive brightness is not great. The phone is not tuning it well based on lightings.

"
"

  Supper smooth phone ever i usedDesign impressive and performance 👌

"
"

  Hang problem

"
"

  One plus is better than all phone high good with 90 ghz display this phone is better than all

"
"

  You can close your eyes and go for this phone ... I felt the best experience using this phone

"
"

  Bad experience

"
"

  Rear camera is just wowIn this price range you have no other optionJust go for it

"
"

  Waste of money

  Points to note:1. Performance wise its one of the best phone to use, no less than any other available phone.2. Advantages over OnePlus 7T- better performance, an extra year of software upgradation, much better battery life, better camera and video results due to software difference. The extra telephoto lens in 7T is an advantage but in practical use, the most used cameras are primary and ultra wide.3. Display is amazing, 90h refresh rate makes browsing seamless. Full HD Amoled display is all what one needs in a mobile phone.4. 6.55 inch, 20:9 ratio makes the phone easy to hold and lets one realize that its still a phone and not a tablet.4. Hole Punch display like, notch display has one disadvantage that in apps like Netflix or Prime Video, access to full screen is restricted. This is very frustrating and one misses the joy of watching contents on full-screen like in 7pro and 7TPro.5. Battery life is good enough, battery lasts for a full whole day and fully charges in an hour. My average Screen on Time is usually upto 8 hours with Bluetooth and location always on. I always keep the charge in between 15%-95%.6. Connection through data, wi-fi, bluetooth has no issues.7. Oxygen OS is a big big advantage and truly is one of the best UI available.Verdict- Just go for the phone. 128/8 version is recommended. Don't compare with last generation One Plus, Samsung phones. One should always go for the best tech available if one intends to use it for atleast 2 years.Using this phone is a fantastic experience.I moved from iPhone 7 to this and dont regret my decision at all.

"
"

  I'm very disappointed with one plus.. I was looking to buy a budgeted phone.. but I always fancied one plus.. so no matter what I decided to go for one plus next series which was one plus 8... After I brought this phone within 20days one plus announced launch of one plus Nord... Which was budgeted and also features almost 90% equal to one plus 8.. it's really a big let down for people who have brought one plus 8.. in fact I could have picked up 2 phones at this cost..  I hope at least one plus should compensate one plus 8 customers with Ear Pods + and extended warranty.. to keep the customer happy...

"
"

  So I got my oneplus 8 on 20th May!! Ordered it on 18th so maybe I got it first that's what I think so it's been 1 month and here is my review ( always remember customer review is always better than tech youtubers)DisplayDisplay is top notch, punch hole doesn't not bother but there is some accidental touch issues while playing games like pubg, cod, etc due to its curved display apart from that no problem specs says its all!!PerformanceDon't even think performance, it's sd865 it's beast no issue at all throw anything at it, it will handle it smoothly without lag or anythingCameraSo first of all macro sucks!!! Maybe oneplus will do something about it in future updatesDue to lockdown, unable to click some outdoor pics that's why posted couple of indoor picsNightmode needs some fixingAnd yeah if you Still want macro shoots, go for 2x optical zoom ( coz main sensor  is 48 mp and during telephoto, it captures 12 mp binned pics so when you zoom, you actually get details what 48mp shots actually gives hope you understand am not good at this part)Weight, in hand feel, etcWeight is 180g so very light, it's sturdy and durable, in hand feel is excellent just buy one plus 's sandstone bumper case and it will be cherry on a cake, or you can use the free tpu case  if you wishConclusionIt got every sensor, every thing you need so if you are a serious camera lover then you should buy 8 pro but if you want performance, more than average camera setup and all this phone is for you 45k is not bad regarding what you are getting and yeah oxygen os and 90 hertz uff only you can feel it after using it

"
"

  Comparing my experience of using OnePlus 5T prior to this.... Width of the phone is lesser, difficult to type without errors... Maybe this and In-Display fingerprints is all about getting used to...But not having Led Light, Not having Audio Jack, and not having Ear Phones included in the box is huge setback for someone who has been relying on simplicity of using phones and getting notified.Earlier Ear Phones were like included in the box or at least it should have included a connector USB to Audio jack given the amount they charge, I did not expect them to support other additional businesses.Except for these ranting... Phone is great! In terms of functionality, speed, and performance.

"
"

  I am using oneplus 5T amd this one I purchased for my wife but I m completely disappointed with the product.Camera quality is not upto the mark.Lot of Hanging problems even in using whatsapp the moble hang many times.There should a 3.5 mm audio jack.

"
"

  GETTING FLAGSHIP ANDROID PERFORMANCE:In functional terms, you’re getting the same performance with the 8 as the 8 Pro. That’s a lot of spec for a device that starts at ₹42k, and the result is a phone that absolutely delivers flagship Android performance. Apps open quickly, games run well, and it generally feels like a fast device to use.You’re also getting a very similar-looking device — from the front at least — as the Pro, with a hole-punch selfie camera and an in-display fingerprint sensor.The OnePlus 8’s main camera does a great job in well-lit conditions.

"
"

  I like the performance of the phone. It a home run for oneplus and also for amazon bcz they managed an on time delivery in the pandemic situation of Covid 19 also. Oneplus has done gr8 job with their finger print scanner the best responsive panel I ve ever used. Battery life is also good, as I am heavy user of phone but it manages to last whole day, quiet good. Camera quality is good but needs more improvement in portrait mode and saturation of the image is bit off. Otherwise it is a ""Flagship killer"". Well done 👍😊

"
"

  Plz boycott the chinese company phones if we keep buying there phones it affects  our country. Think about the soldiers and there families why we doing so think please think. Galwaan is a wake up call for every indian, we should consider local brands if we didn't buy who is going to buy. Together we can improve and win.

"
"

  I have received oneplus8 on August 1st. Till now 2 months passed. One of my colleague received oneplus Nord on the same day. Till now he got 4 software updates. But I got only one update in the first week.The second point is about the calculator. There is no M+ M- MC MR memory related options in calculator. But there is a option to check calculations history. But to add some calculated figures its difficult without memory options. Till now I have experienced 2 times of hanging. I am disappointed.

"
"

  This is not a review for oneplus 8, rather sharing my frustration for not being able to get hold of the PRO version for almost a month now. Every single time the sale starts, its gone in less than a minute. I've erred as well, I was never on time during the early launch days and now it doesn't make any difference. I think I'll NEVER be able to SETTLE on a 12GB PRO Onyx Black. Alas, given up hope now.

"
"

  Too expensive for its price, people say ban Chinese products, on the other end people are still buying and enjoying the products.

"
"

  I had expected a better battery and the phone yet sometimes hangs all of a sudden. Infact my OnePlus 5 was better then this in battery.

"
"

  Low light bad quality camera. Go for  good brand

"
"

  [Click on me for more recommended products] I ordered this amazing product for my sister on Raksha Bandhan, Better battery life Than all iPhones. Camera is also amazing just in love with this ♥️

"
"

  What a fantastic phone... I dont know why some people are saying that one plus 7T is better than one plus 8. I used one plus 7T also but i have noticed a big difference in both phones. One plus 8 is amazing. What a superb curved display. I loved this. Completely satisfied with one plus 8.

"
"

  Great phone with awesome camera and inbuilt filters which my old phone doesn't have(OnePlus 5T), battery is also quite good; one charge will last you a day easily. Gaming is also hell of a beast. I bought the 8GB/128GB variant.

"
"

  Bought both of them in June. Impressive performance. Comprehensive battery backup and faster it gets. Easily 10/10 on the expectations.

"
"

  Third class camera.. disappointed. Blurred picture not smooth. Looking for another phone now not for one plus.  Thankyou for giving me this bad one ..One Plus😑👎👎

  Pros:-Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones. Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?!-Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job.-Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried.-Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything.-Games run very smooth!-Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG timeCons-Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING)-Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like. However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me.ALEXA-Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE.-That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set!Conclusion-This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships. However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.

  I was previously using OnePlus 5 and this review is after using OP 8 for a week.Things I liked -1) This phone is a beast when it comes to performance. Super smooth. 90 hz is amazing. It's more than what is needed for an average user and I don't think we need to fall for 120 hz.2) Dual speakers. If you are someone who uses phone speakers a lot, you'll be very satisfied with sound quality of the Dolby Atmos dual speakers.3) Screen size is perfect for me. I don't like to use very big phones which cannot be used with single hand and that's the reason why I opted for OP 8 and not 8 pro and I am happy. Can do most of the tasks with a single hand.4) Display and brightness is also bang on. Great display for watching movies on phone and the auto brightness works perfectly.5) Gaming performance is outstanding as well. I have played pubg and Asphalt Legends and both work flawlessly. Pubg now supports 90 hz for OnePlus devices so you can use the setting of HDR + 90 hz and it's a different feeling after using an old device which lags even on smooth + extreme. There are no lags when a lot of enemies are around and performance in custom room is also good.6) Easily getting one full day of heavy usage and no complaints on the battery.7) Wifi reception - this was very surprising for me. My wifi router is in my living room and if I play pubg in my bedroom, I used to get a ping of 100-110 on my old device. But with OP 8, I am getting a constant ping of 30-40 ms which is great. I did not expect this and am very happy with Wifi 6 technology on this phone.Things I did not like -1) Majority apps don't support the full screen (yet). This was a shocker for me that when you watch Netflix/Prime you cannot watch on the full screen. There is one black bar on the top and one on the bottom which means you can only use around 80% of the screen. I checked with OnePlus and they said that only the apps running on API 10 or above are supported for full screen. if you download API checked from play store, you'll see which apps are running on which API version and most of them are running on API 9. Which means they are not supported for full screen viewing. This was disappointing because even Instagram stories can't be viewed on full screen mode. Hopefully they improve this in future update.2) Absence of a notification light. I really miss that from my old phone. As always on display is not there (yet) there is no way to see if there is any notification or not without tapping on the screen.3) Average camera. I am not the one who takes a lot of photos but still, I wished the camera was slightly better. I cannot tell the details like what is missing in the camera but all I can say is that as a common man, once you look at a photo you feel that something is missing..4) No USB type C to 3.5 mm convertor provided. This is very disappointing to me. Firstly it's difficult to get used to the fact that there is no 3.5 mm jack. Sometimes you really miss that. I went on a road trip with my family and forgot the convertor at home. Wasn't able to play any songs in the car via the aux cable. Moreover, they don't even provide a convertor. After spending so much on the device, I feel we atleast deserve that in the box. Coz once you go to the store, you will find different convertors ranging from 100-500. You obviously will go for the exepnsive one and it also does not come with any guaranty. So add another 400-500 INR to the phone price.5) No proper tempered glass available due to the curved display. As the display is curved, a standard tempered glass won't work proeprly as it leads to fingerprint issues. You'll have to go for a UV glass which will again cost you somewhere around 600-1000. Tip- avoid installing it on your own. If you buy it online, I would suggest you still take it to a store and get it installed by giving him some extra money. It would also take a couple of days for the device to learn your fingerprint with the UV glass so be patient.Overall I really like this phone and enjoy using it. I think I am a heavy user and still don't feel the need for the Pro model as this one suffices all my needs. Acc to me you should go for the Pro model ONLY if you1) have had experiences in the past where you dip your phone in water and need an IP rating to be sure2) are picky when it comes to the camera and want maybe a 20 % better cameraOtherwise OP 8 is your man! Go for it!Thanks for reading!

  Camera department need to be improvement other things are fine.

  Product seems to be defective just after using it for 16 days. Front Camera is bad. Battery charge doesn't last as mentioned. Network always drops off for no rradoy. Always required to refresh by switching to aeroplane mode and to mobile data.. Product is not worth any penny spend. Worst is the return window is closed!

"
"

  Excellent experience so far. Oneplus tech team done their job really well.This is my first oneplus mobileCompare to my old phone experience:1. Battery is good and easily last 1.5 days with my usage pattern like few calls in a day, browsing internet and apps2. Network is really great. My old phone was struggling to get network from my home but this phone does the job really well.3. Speed is one of the talking point. Great speed and I hope most of us agree to this as it has latest SD processor with 8GB RAM4. Back camera is good but front camera need bit more attention I believe.Overall I am happy with Oneplus 8.Great phone :)

"
"

  This OnePlus 8 really rocks!!! one the best phone that i have ever used ( After using more then one month). Using Oneplus phones from the very fast edition i.e. OnePlus One, very very satisfied with the quality that OnePlus has given. This is my third edition of OnePlus after using OnePlus One, OnePlus 5. It's got everything that anybody asked for. Thanks OnePlus for producing beast like this with beauty. Thanks Amazon for packaging, gr8 exchange offer with fast delivery timeline in this pandemic also.

"
"

  Guys I have bought this product reading some 80 good reviews and trust me till last night I was also on clould nine with this purchase but in morning when I picked up the phone this cover already left the edges making it look like sticking only on front screen which destroys the entire screen look of one plus 8. Pathetic product just waste of money .. regretting this purchase 🔥

"
"

  I have ever seen worst mobile like one plus 8 .....poor camera quality ....Alexa is not working properly .....Also I have faced hidden charges of SBI card  ...initially it has given discount and no cost emi.. but latter they will charge full amount ....No return policy for this mobile ...only exchange is possibleWorst mobile and hidden charges on SBI card from Amazon.

"
"

  Awesome phone as i am using oneplus since oneplus one and i tell you oneplus keep improving their phone.phone is reall bang for buck awesome battery life warp charge so fast and oxygen os is the best available os there.I was not expecting much from camera but camera is surprisingly good macro shots are awesome i am in love with camera phone is full of features only thing I was expecting up waterproof rating overall just go buy.

"
"

  My order details stated that this product was sold by Darshita Electronics and it didn't have a warranty card inside it. I wonder if this is an original product and will the warranty be still applicable?Also, one plus claims 1% to 50% in 22 minutes. However I charged from 2% for 24 minutes and it reached 35%. The second reason to wonder if this was an original product!!

"
"

  A good quality phone with 5 G technology. Good camera and speaker in built with phone .

"
"

  I believe,Most of the people like me have a double mind in between 8 and 8pro. I my opinion I suggest to go for 8. it's worth for money. No doubt.

"
"

  Great look, perform swiftly.. super class camera.. stunning display.. quick charging.. overall complete worth of money..  Its a truely reallly actuall flagship device from oneus...  100% satisfied . Oneplus rockzzz...

"
"

  SD 865 SOC with Oxizen OS is now super smoothSmart sms is best of bestAI is at topAfter shot image processing is greatFar better than MI 10, IQOO 3 , REALME X50 Pro

"
"

  Light in weight camera quality not as per mark battery is good speed is good if you are having 7series ph no need to buy 8

"
"

  Every photo clicked with this phone is awesome. Display colors are mesmerizing. I think the only phone better than this is oneplus 8 pro.

"
"

  Bought this phone during Sale. I have used OnePlus 3T, OnePlus 6 and now OnePlus 8.It is one of the best phone with good battery life, Superb Camera, Excellent Display, Dynamic music quality and many features.

"
"

  I bought 8GB RAM model. I found that hanging issues in the mobile. Really shocked. I never expected from Oneplus. Totally disappointed.

"
"

  Happy with overall product. 90hz impacts battery life so went back to 60 and didn't notice much of a difference.

"
"

  Totally superb. But finding temper glass for this model is quite difficult.

"
"

  On time delivery by amazonAnd the product is as expectedNot bad

"
"

  Almost... Satisfactory in all segments .. Price may be looking higher

"

  Best app is OnePlus switch, it's make ur new oneplus phone same as old oneplus, even wallpaper also get copied, and it's place app as it is.

  OnePlus is getting into the greedy money making spree now just like apple. You don't get what you pay for. This phone is worth 35k. Not 44k.

  I know it's an amazing device & I'm as in love with this smartphone as you can be.But but but but but......WILL YOU STILL BUY A CHINESE PHONE WHEREIN THOSE BUGGERS KILLED OUR ARMY MEN ?NO HARD FEELINGS BUT, REAL HARD FEELINGS IF IT HURTS OUR COUNTRY'S SENTIMENTS.

  Very good battery life lasts for more than 8 hours even after playing games constantly. A very good camera which captures very good pictures. The fingerprint sensor also works fine and it is difficult to login when there is dust around it does not allow to login easily.Did not post a review earlier just because wanted to get hands-on and then review here. Been almost 1.5 months now and the phone works very well. Recommend to buy this phone if you are thinking of getting one.

  More features could've been added.

  First of All, OnePlus phones are now Made In India totally from the OnePlus 8 series. Even Apple phones are Made in China, but not OnePlus Now. Now coming to the Phone,The OnePlus 8 sets the bar high for affordable flagships in 2020. While its design refinements borrow elements from other flagships, it's an undeniably sleek phone, with waterfall display edges and a punch-hole for the front-facing camera. With a Snapdragon 865 and up to 12GB of RAM, the phone is high-performance despite costing notably less than most flagships, making it the cheapest ""5G"" phone in many markets.As for how the OnePlus 8 measures up to devices beyond those made by OnePlus itself, there's a compelling case to be made for this flagship phone. The OnePlus 8 performs as well as any leading Android device and even makes the iPhone 11 sweat a little. You'll get very good battery life — at least when the phone's faster refresh rate isn't taxing the battery.The display itself is the same size as the OnePlus 7T's, measuring 6.55 inches. It's an AMOLED panel, with a full-HD+ resolution, HDR10+ compatibility, and a refresh rate of 90Hz. OnePlus also brags about the panel's high colour accuracy. From what i have seen so far, the display is definitely bright, with good sunlight legibility and punchy colours. You also get lots of options in the Settings app to tweak the colours to your liking.For a phone with such a big screen, the OnePlus 8 doesn't take up that much space, at least when it comes to width. At 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches, OnePlus' phone is taller than the iPhone 11 (5.94 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches) and Galaxy S20 (5.9 x 3 x 0.31 inches), though not as wide. With 8mm of thickness, the OnePlus 8 is also fractionally thinner than Apple's iPhone 11, so you'll have minimal trouble slipping the OnePlus device into a pocket. At 6.3 ounces, it's lighter than the iPhone 11, too, though not as light as the 5.7-ounce S20.The OnePlus 8 comes with a 4,300-mAh battery — bigger than the 3,800-mAh power pack in the OnePlus 7T though not as large as the 4,510 mAh battery you'll get by paying up for the OnePlus 8 Pro. That shouldn't matter too much, as the OnePlus 8 delivers superlative battery life.A bigger tradeoff that OnePlus 8 owners have to make, at least compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, concerns the cameras. While the Pro model features four lenses, the OnePlus 8 sports only three — and one of those isn’t a telephoto lens. Instead, the 48-megapixel main shooter with its f/175 aperture and 16MP ultra wide camera are joined by a 2MP macro lens. That's great, in theory, for taking detailed objects, but if you want to zoom in, you're at the mercy of a digital zoom that can add noise to your shots. But yes, its getting betterand better with every other updates OnePlud is launching like every week.Overall, would i recommend this phone? Obviously Yes, its a steal deal for the price! Plus you get the best android experience! (I would say even better than iOS)

"
"

  Okayish

"
"

  Good but it would be better if it would be dust resistant

"
"

  From the beginning itself my phone's screen freezes various times, I filled complaints several times still no response from the customer service department. And I feel like I wasted money for a hanging mobile.

"
"

  Best thing you can get under 50,000.screen is the main highlight of this device and the hepatic feedback is amazing still not as good as apple. Camera might disappoint you. If you want a great camera and wireless charging go for pro version other wise this is the best match for you.
