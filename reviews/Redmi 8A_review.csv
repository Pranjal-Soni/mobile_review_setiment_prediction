  Before buying you must know the difference between 7k mobile and 10k to 15K Mobiles .Reason for choosing this title earlier i used a pro version model , Now i am reviewing this model after 3 days of usage.1. Ear speaker quality in outdoor's very poor  . Keep your headphones handy ,2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price )3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function .Rest all other functions are good  .

   Worst phone ever. Don't buy ths phone.heating issue at the bottom side of touch screen, touch button as well as ghost touch activates on its own within 1-2 minutes and you can not use any of the app properly.Initially thought it may be a due to some kind of virus, even after company reset issue is there and also you can see screen flickering very easily.

  This is my 4th MI Phone in 3 years. Earlier ones were good.But here The extra battery has made phone heavier and hence has lost it charm, now looks like chinese phone. Earlier ones were as good as other phone apart from brand.Not recommended.Would love to return but it was gift for family,

  I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone!In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone.The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).

  Mobile is good at this priceBut when I was using hotspot and screen recording the mobile became overheated it hanged so i switch off it.In this range mobile is really good..

  We are highly unsatisfied with the product .There is performance issue with the phone in which the touch ,speed as well as the processor is very slow.It does not worth the money and the sound quality is also low.The battery also gets drained very early though it is of 5000 mAH.We have mailed a return request but they have not taken any action.I need to return this phone and want a new phone as soon as possible.

"

  The phone hangs a lot. Processor is too slow. Apps close on their own. Can't ecen listen yo music continuously.

  Defective display (minor scratch) on the scratch and there is now way i can return / service / request replacement.

  Top smartphone in this priceEXCELLENCE camera , great display

"
"

  I purchased this phone in Feb. 2020  from Amazon site and now it's May 2020 and  I find it difficult to swipe it open after the display goes on sleep mode.  So this is the status it's touch mechanism within 3 months.  So one has to be careful about buying cheap quality Redmi phones as the touch mechanism may not be of good quality..

"
"

  Nice design,heavy, gr8 display size , camera quality poor, battery capacity excellentGood price for these features

"
"

  Phone is good, no finger print reader, but price is disappointingBecause it is launched at a price of 6499 now see the price

"
"

  The phone has many pros and some cons.The cons are :Speaker sound is not that good.Sound with bluetooth headphone ,earphone is not good.Equalizer can not be used in case of bluetooth headsets, earphones.There should be a 4 ,64 gb variant.There are some MI apps which can not be uninstalled.Camera is ok, medium quality.

"
"

   From 12 the day it is not working. Mi service center re installed the software but still it is not working

  Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM)Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface.OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update.Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment.Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic.RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.No Heating Issue: I'm not a gamer, but if you are an average you will not find any heating issue, at least most of the time.

"

  I was purchased Redmi 8A on.  19/02/2020,  but received phone is defective,  i was already registered my complain, but Amazon not postive response.

"
"

  I wasted my money on this phone,Phone hang a lot and all functions start working automatically and iam not able to restart the phone. So at that time I have to wait for 20 30mints.I demand product replacement or refund plz.

  I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews!Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.

"
"

  Pros:*Cool battery*Type c charger and fast charging*Corning Gorilla glass 5(toughness)*Splashproof*Wireless FMCons:*Too many pre-installed unwanted apps which would kill internal storage and ram space*No private safe, but covered with second space. (Hide option is provided for folder as a whole, not for individual file/image. That too without password protection!! Too bad*processor performance is not great but good.*presence of Finger print sensor would be great*Both the cameras are too bad.. would feel like having 5 mp camera.*Weights heavy due to 5k battery

   My review for Seller Appario :2nd ViDEO :DEFECTIVE PIECE: Mobile is misbehaving... suddenly clicking on any/many app... ""WITHOUT TOUCHING ON SCREEN""... suddenly opening Gmail... suddenly opening SMS and start typing... very sad...

  Missing fingerprint sensor but nice phone with nice design

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad.Pros:good battery lifelarge screenlook and feel is nicecamera is good for its priceCons:THIS HANDSET IS MADE IN CHINAI thought it is Redmi (made in India), but it is made by Xiomi.Does not have fingerprint scanner.

"
"

  It is fantastic phone for you if you are a normal user and not  a gamer . But unfortunately I received the handset is defective (I dont know that other have faced it or not) . In some app like BHIM UPI it shows the device is rooted. You can not oparate may app in rooted device . So please make sure that if your device same problem . If yes then mark my review as helpful. Thak me latter.

"
"

  Service is good but........

"
"

  Cons:1. Very bad camera. Selfie camera is not even enough for video calling.2. Performance is not up to mark with 3gb RAM.3. Heating problem with extensive usage of internet or gaming.4. Many unnecessary apps which cannot be removed are impacting performance.Pros:1. Very good battery life.2. Nice display and well built.3. Budget phone.Overall, it is a budget smartphone with less smartness. Lot of notifications which are unable to remove with many unnecessary apps in OS.

"
"

  Cons: No fingerprint sensor.No Widevine L1 support.Not a good camera at all. Photos captured are blurry and unclear. Totally disappointed with the camera.Too many MI built in apps which reduces the usable memory in hand.Pros: Premium quality design.Feels good in hand.Corning Gorilla Glass 5.Type C port.Fast charging.Dedicated Memory Card slot expandable upto 512 GB.Super Class Audio Speakers. Sound is very good. Listening music is very much enjoyable.Not heating up while charging.Display not bad at all.All in all a good phone at this price range.

"
"

  I have purchased 8A dual but its not a good product ,i have buy many product from amazon but i havent recevied such a bab product these phone camera is not good & get blink any while opening app..& phone get swtich off..while video call camera is not stable i request you to change the product & refund the money asap...i m not happy with this product..these issue i m facing from 1 month..

"
"

  When I receive this item it was 63% charge then I put charge after two hours it get only 68% only then I put whole night charge next day morning it get only 80% charge.. I totally disappointed..After that I returned this item then I received new mobile when I opened I directly put into charge, I get the same issue I don't what a do.. what they are doing I don't know they not checks properly and not inspected.. I really upset this service..

"
"

  In this price segment this is the worst mobile I have used yet. Camera is above average not best, there is a big issue in this phone is network and wifi connection issue.Phone automatically disconnected wifi connection all the time and network is also very weak comparing to other mobiles. One big issue I found today that touch is working automatically. And there is another problem with Amazon to replace the phone that now I have to post the phone to Amazon then they will send a new phone.Third class performance

"
"

  First  of  all I would like to say,""IT IS THE BEST PHONE UNDER ₹10,000""....*GOOD Selfie and Rear cameras at this price.*FAST CHARGING*GOOD PERFORMANCE*STYLISH EXTERNAL DESIGNS*BEST SPEAKERS*BEST FOR PLAYING GAMES LIKE FREEFIRE ,PUBG etc...(but You should play with Standard Graphics otherwise occurs a heating issue )*NO FINGERPRINT FACILITY*NO EARPHONES AVAILABLE WITH THE PHONE*PREVENT THE DEVICE FROM RUNNING IN LOW SPACE other wise There will be a Lag iSsue..

"
"

  First off all it is a good product for this price. Good looking and smooth. But..The camera is too cheap that it is a waste having dual camera for this quality. May be it's software issue.And IT LACK A FINGER PRINT SENSORbut HAVE FACE UNLOCK INSTEAD,it is pretty good.The phone is LITTLE BIT BULKY may be because of 5000mAh battery pack.Anyway it's is good as a budget phone

"
"

  The phone comes with a 6.22-inch touchscreen display with a resolution of 720x1520 pixels and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The Redmi 8A Dual runs Android 9.0 and is powered by a 5000mAh battery.The phone is a bit heavier though compare to the other ones. And sometimes it gets over heated.Overall, it's an affordable phone with a very reasonable amount of money.

"
"

  Excellent mobile to use... Bought for my father and he loved it as he starts to use it.Big battery lasts longer.Excellent display, vibrant colours presentation, nice photos and videos, up to the mark... Thanks Amazon for perfect package and delivery on time.From company side in the box, No screen guard and no mobile pouch provided.

"
"

  • Camera Quality is acceptable (Don't expect much quality).• Not a gaming processor. (Snapdragon 439)• No fingerprint reader.• Face Unlock is present.• Out of the box type-c charger is present.• Correct fit in hand.• Gives a good inhand feel.• We can play some heavy games in it (PUBG is included).• Excellent Display.• Dual 4G support is there.• 2.5 hours charging time (20% to 100%).

"
"

  The mobile phone is best option for those user that needs good battery backup. Beautiful looking mobile. Type C charging port but charger supplied with this mobile is 2 mAh type C Charger.

"
"

  1. Battery Life is Good - Lasted for 1.5 days on one charge2. Full Charge took 1 Hour which is ok for 5000 MAH Battery3. Mobile is a little heavier due to battery4. The phone did not heat up though used continuouslyGood Buy at the offered priceImprovement Areas1. AI Camera is not that fast2. Already MI Security Patch is released and takes 1.7 GB of data for update, No problem for wifi users but heavy on cellular networks3. Lot of adds and push notifications, Disable them4. Camera Quality fair enough for this Price, Dont expect super trendy clarity5. Always notifies to update the built in apps all the time, they will work though not updated.

  Fast charger not given in box of productThis is not a made in India productSo don't buy thisInstant this product buy Honour 9S mobile which is latest Android and features loaded alsoThank you

  Best budjet smartphone from redmiIt worth my money Excellent smartphone 👍🔥💥Thank you Amazon and XioamiThe most interesting thing is you get 5000 mh battery in this budjet.But redmi should add fingerprint scanner in this smartphoneBut overall the phone is Good

"
"

  Great phone and you will get all the high end phone trending (gestures, raise to wake, dark mode and much more) customizations with miui11.People who are not willing to spend a fortune on the devices can easily upgrade to this one.For daily usage beats all categories.Love it.

"
"

  Placed for return! Still not sure when my return will be processed! Amazon Customer service is closed!The adapter of charger DIDNT WORKSOFTWARE FAILURE IS THERE! Identified and reported the very next day of purchase!

"
"

  My mom’s been using this for around a month now. It looks great, and found no issues yet.Tbh, display is too big. If you like big screen phones then go for it. Go for the 3GB RAM version, since 2GB one is too slow.Display: 5/5 (No issues at all)Sound: 3.5/5 (It’s loud but not that great)Camera: 3.5/5 (Dual cameras but photos are not at good)Battery: 5/5 (My mom doesn’t use it that much, so battery lasts up to 3-4 days easily)Quality: 5/5 (It’s plastic but the built is nice)Overall: 4/5 (Works out great for my mom at this price. Satisfied)

"

  Bought this for my father who is 75 years old, suggested by my son who is 15 years old. Both of them are impressed for different reasons. Father, for the light weight and non-slippery hold, son, for the speed, camera quality and sturdiness. I am happy because it is value for money. Overall, a great deal for first time users.

"
"

  This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features.Battery capacity is amazingCamera is ok not so good.Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately.Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also.Overall I like this Phone.Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written ""Warrenty Card is not given"" in their review and for the seller).Hope this will help.Thank you.

  I purchased Redmi 8A Dual on 27th July 2020. It has 7 days return policy. After 15 days the phone was switched off automatically and after several trying phone did not power on. I go to the redmi authorized service center for servicing of the mobile phone. They tell me that the phone was water damaged. Due to this I did not get any warranty. But they did not open the mobile in front of me for checking.  Worst quality of phone I ever seen and worst quality of service center they have.

"
"

  Not a good product. Took it to service center. First they changed software. But again started to hang. Requested for replacement, but not getting replacement during warranty. I purchased this because of its high rating and it looks amazon rating is fake.

"
"

  I ordered this phone on behalf of a relative and she confirmed tht the battery last only 2-3 hours.When she went to MI service centre, they said tht they cannot replace the phone because it is bought on Amazon and Amazon should replace it. Some nonsense.They have finally agreed to replace the battery.please be careful buying Mi Phones.

"
"

  It's working fineBest phone in this rangeLooking for I was looking for a phone under 8000 for my younger brother as he was having very tight budget so I search many phone went to market in the market offline this phone was being sold about 8500 but I got on Amazon in 7500 only you can see it is available on Flipkart another platform over 8000Other alternative of his phone in the same range having low quality processor and no gorilla glass screen c type charging in this range you cannot find anywherePhone has premium looks

"
"

  I bought it on 13 jul 20 and from last 10 days I am having a huge problem like battery is getting down very fast, phone is getting hanged again and again. When sometime someone is calling me my phone screen is getting totally black. Messages are sometimes been shown in dragbox but when I am touching it or finding it in inbox it is invisible. I am totally hopeless that what I have bought. Total waste of money.

"
"

  A good dual camera phone in this price range. Battery is 5,000 mah, but performs like 4,000 mah. Camera is good. The best thing is its screen. A nice 6.2"" inch display. Similar to most high value mobiles from this same brand. This sky white colour is best among three. A perfect budget phone till date.

"
"

  Posting reviews after using it for 1 month:Cheap quality intarnal materials used ex. Camera sensor, bluetooth, etc.Realized after experiencing following unexpected problems:- screen hanging- bluetooth not connecting now, earlier connecting when it was- leaves the marks/shadow of the icons/screen elements used in previous applications or even after accessing the contacts or any content.- mobile charger gets heated up like anything after 5-10 min of chargingQuality getting cheaper as the number of users increasing. Company only eye on maximizing the profits. That's what the conclusion is.

"
"

  Exactly once 10 days over for replacement 11 th day phone display goes off. Went to service centre asked for replacement they said nit possible done change of display of some other model and given much dissatisfied from this purchase.

"
"

  I think mobile delivered to me today is defective and not in working condition.So it is surprised like a reputed E_Com , Amazon India doing this type of delivery.it hampers your name and fame.please file a case or written compaint to your seller.

  Redmi 8A Dual 3gb 32gb..Mobile average performance..Not available Fingerprint Reader..Battery life performance also average 5000Mah Battery not going full 2 day with normal usage..Camera quality is also average not upto mark..No slow motion video.. not more option..And main thing so many adds on apps unnecessary  getting notifications...Totaly average performance..But good thing is this mobile getting USB TYPE C & Fast Charging Support is available...

"

  I had this Smartphone for my mother. Now after using it about 15 days , I can assure you that Xiaomi has arranged a great deal , but by the time passes new Smartphones will be it's competitors. So remember it's time and current scenario I can completely recommend you to buy this phone if your budget is below 10k .I had ordered 3gb+32gb sea blue variant and got delivered within 5 days , thanks to Amazon. The phone supports 18 watt fast charging and has 5000 mah battery and face unlock , which are unexpected in this price range. But Snapdragon 439 processor is not eligible to do any hard work . I would recommend to use this phone for basics.

"
"

  Important tip: Buy 3GB version to run free fire and other apps without any lags (Available Ram 2 GB/3GB).●Mobile is very good without any lags till now. (using Messenger, Whatsapp, gaana app simultaneously).●Don't buy this mobile for playing high config games. Processsor and graphics hardware are of average quality.●The battery is huge in this mobile. Charging with realme 20W charger took around 2 hours (10% to 95%).●The front and back camera is good in this price segment, and don't expect a quality like 15k mobiles.●The screen comes with a corning gorila 5, with no extra thin screen protector which other phones has.●Face unlock is good but sometimes doesn't work in low light. That is completely ok in 8k mobile.●Now the main thing which I don't like on this phone is useless apps which can't be uninstall. (like MiPay, MI secure vault, etc MI apps). And we can't trust these apps as government banned many MI apps because Xiomi read  and store every activity you do with those apps. So only use google apps to secure data and personal details. BTW it is still not reliable because MI11 OS also can read all your data. Some MI apps has own T&Cs which no one reads before opening. So use Xiomi phones carefully and don't store any banks information or passwords.

  It's not called grey colour... If there is no stock of the required colour,it should be shown to the customer... Should not just give any colour you have.That's the problem,but this colour too is not bad.

  I have upgraded from 7a to 8a, this series was released just three months after the earlier version.The battery🔋 which is 5000mah doesn't seem to be showing lot of difference from the 4000mah on the previous 7a. The only negative being the weight of the phone is a little heavier than the previous one. The blue color looks great but the phone is not easy to hold, you have to add back cover with a grip.Camera is good but the front camera has a lot of AI in it. When I took a picture with the back and front camera, the front looked too bright with a lot of brightness.Call quality is very good and it sounds almost like Nokia quality. Videos look good.  I have dropped my old phone a few times with absolutely no damage to body or phone function. I don't use the face lock so can't comment

"
"

  The phone does not boot up. I am not sure what quality check has gone into the product. unfortunately I was not able to return the product on time and the return window got lapsed. Now I am running at the MI brand store to get the product replaced. I spoke with amazon customer care and the seller and they were not willing to replace the product as it got out of the window. What good is a phone if it does not even boot up, What quality testing was done on the phone. Worst exp with amazon and with the seller. I was asking them for replacement as I could not ope n the product on time due to medical issues.

Network seems okay so far!I still wonder why don't we get an EDGE to EDGE DISPLAY  & why REDMI LOGO had to be down there. Besides why did they had to come out with shady hue (Sky White, Midnight Grey & Sea Blue) versions, & why not just simple sleek 'Black or White' . They could have been more simple though, i don't seem if the design at the rear does any wonders or is  wow factor..Thanks to Amazon!

  The phone is good for the average user. I can say the one who needs streaming apps, whatsApp, Facebook and similar other app will love the phone. Everything is as per expectation. Would have surely liked the product if it was made in India. The model I received is Made in China. Battey backup is good. I am not into much of camera but it comes with 13MP which is good from business point of view.Face recognition is working 7/10 times. No fingerprint scensor. But it's okay for few people like us. Storage is more than enough with 53GB. And 3 GB RAM works well with all apps I mentioned.

"
"

  Defective product. Started auto shutoff and on after just completion of return date. I have purchased it on 12th July 2020. Problem started from 25th July and surprisingly 24th July was last date to return. Very much disappointed. I am purchasing so many products from Amazon. They should check thoroughly before delivering at the cost of their reputation.

"

  This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.

  I take online classes so video and voice must be clear. The mobile should be slim and light weight to put on tripod.  I needed a rough and tough high performance phone within my budget constraints.C type charging pin means long pin life. Battery backup is superb, Speaker sound is quite loud, slim body and vibrant colours look smart. Camera is more than enough to fulfill my need as an amateur photographer.Display and handling is quite good. Normal apps work smoothly and I don't use phone for gaming. WhatsApp, Facebook, youtube, etc work well and 64GB Storage with 3GB RAM is more than enough for me.

"

  Pros:1.Great Battery Backup.2. The display quality is good.3. The processor is powerful enough for daily tasks not for gaming.4. The only phone with Type-C charging port under 10k, supports fast charging.Cons:1. No fingerprint reader.2. Pre-installed Bloatware.3. Normal charger instead of a fast charger.4. Average camera: Good in daylight(Use Gcam for best results).Overall a decent phone for a college student, Family members.

  Defective product received as with many other users. The phone has ghost touch problem. This seems to be the issue with this phone model and also in general with Redmi phones as is apparent from several online forums. Since I only noticed this problem after the return period was over, Amazon wasn't ready to extend any support on this. The problem has only aggravated since and the phone now dials numbers  or opens apps on its own. For the first time in my life, I have faced a hardware issue with a brand new phone. Redmi QC seems to be very lax. Now I need to take it to the service centre. It is really annoying to send a new product for servicing and be left without a phone after spending your hard earned money.

  Its average phone and disappointed with Amazon as they havent mentioned country of origin as China

  Writing this review after using this device for 2 months.Delivery was super fast (Delivered in just 2 days)..Pros :-1. Big Display (This 6'22"" display is really good for day to day usage).2. Battery & Charging - 5000 mAH battery lasts upto 2 to 2½ days for a normal usage and this supports 18w fast charger and also have USB Type-C cable which is excellent in this price range.3. Look & Feel - This entry level smartphone have a polycarbonate back which is decent and have a good grip..., And it also have Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection in the front.4. Face Unlock feature - This smartphone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but have a face Unlock which is quite reliable and works well..Cons :-1. Processor - They should have gone for Snapdragon 450 or 460, SD439 is old processor.2.  Bloatwares - There are adds in this device & also have few bloatwares like Mi Community & Helo App which are banned by Indian Government..Overall this is a good upgrade from Redmi 7A at this price range..If you want an entry level smartphone this one is good.

"
"

  This is a great product under the 10k range..personally loved it.Though it doesn't have finger print sensor its beautifully designed and can be used.. i've bought this for my father n he loves it.. battery life is 5000mah which is huge and camera quality is good for this range. . so you can definitely give a try

"
"

  The phone is beautifully designed, including the patterned plastic back and the dewdrop notch design. the battery life is good but it could be better but since it's miui,there isn't much you can get apart from ads in the UI which are hard to turn off,there's a lot of invasive bloatware and adware,also the camera quality is average,there was no need for a dual cam setup(I feel the lower camera can be fake),the front cam is average too,I think should've gone with the 9i. Also, there's no screen protector or cover in box

"
"

   Bought  a new redmi dual 8A through Amazon .There is a technical issue with this handset.its functioning on it's own .various screen and key pad functions start functioning without even touching the handset.Amazon is not willing  to replace the handset. What a waste of money

"
"

  I have got a defective product today I pluged earphone but it didn't work than I thought the ear phone is faulty I tried new one but this didn't work too. Then I tried both earphone on another phone these were working.And returning period is also over but the good thing is I rarely use earphone but when I tried earphone today first time and found the product is faulty I have got a lot of anger but it was my mistake too that I didn't check it in starting days.Ya, but it worthy to be criticized.Instead of this sometimes it's touch do not respond instantly, I have got this problem later.

"

  Everything is good in mobile but processor is little bit slow(if u r a game user not recommended). Also if u use many applications simultaneously then mobile will go slow.Some how I disappointed that chinese applications is still in there by default and you can't uninstall them,such as mi browser,mi music, mi pay, cleanmaster, mi video, xiaomi wheather etc. Chinese applications is banned in india and company xiaomi india also remove all these Chinese applications.Overall recommended if u r not a heavy user battery backup is good and type-c charger  which support 18watt fast charging is the only pros of this mobile.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not available, face unlock feature is available, value for money phone for this price range , I exchanged with my old HTC device ,it costs me around 6299 Rs for 2GB variant , built quality is good, feels solid in hand , sky white colour looks pretty decent and beautiful in hand, cannot expect a good gaming  performance from this device, tried playing Pubg lite & Free fire, not suitable for gamming. Best part is battery back up & USB Type C charging port with fast charging options available. Not satisfied with the face unlock feature. Can be considered as a good option for secondary handset, overall a value for money product.

  Product is working slowly. Keyboard not working properly. Was trying to return the product, showing is not eligible. Product was delivered on 4th March. Within a month all these issues are coming up. Feeling really bad.

"
"

  I have read the reviews before buying the mobile. So thought to give it a luck. After using for 1 day the mobile screen keep on touching itself from any part of the screen. The phone hangs a lot. Pubg runs good at times but a lot of time it lags. I checked the battery performance in setting, the screen itself consuming more than 94% of battery which makes battery drain rapidly. I have replaced it. Now got a replacement with tampered mobile box. However the packing was not tempered. To my surprise it is a used mobile. Fingerprint of former user was found on mobile screen and charger. The mi seal was broken and re-pasted and delivered to me. The seller think himself oversmart. Keep distributing used mobile to the customers. I have checked this mobile condition which is good at outside but the internet connectivity is very poor it does not go beyond 350kb at 2am midnight Jio 4G. Which goes beyond 2Mbps at this time in other mobile phone. Also charger is heated up when charging within 20 minutes and it's not 18W power charger. So i got a defective used product in replacement.  Now i  want my refund. I am not satisfied with this mobile. The conclusion is that if you are lucky enough than this mobile will work for a few day until replacement period is over or maximum 15 days later you will repent at your choice. Better put 1-2k more and get better mobile than this Redmi 8A Dual 3-32.

  The Budget BeastNo words to describe the new Redmi 8A especially its stunning look ... amazing display with water drop notch looks premium. This design is seen only in 15 k segment from Samsung where Xiaomi did it.Awesome cameraI have used 4A & 7A but comes to 8A its totally changed in camera. Its AI powered camera gives excellent output even in low light conditions  worth it...oooohIncredible Battery but not hulky5000 mAh class leading battery gives approximate two days of normal use without charging twice. Not much bulky in hand and weight is optimized!!!!! wowperformance is out of the worldGames, movies, chatting, shooting no compromise on multitasking Smoothly run by octa core chipset from Snapdragon 439 is excellent at this price point is amazing....octa core at 6K OMG....main disadvantage I have noticed is there is no notification led...

  Battery is okCamera is goodBut missing warranty cardWhy cheated like this fruaders

"
"

  Ok phone. Brought as I got good exchange price of my old phone against purchase of redmi 8a dual. Speed ok. Phone hangs sometimes. Camera ok. Call quality and battery life superb. Display very good for budget phone. One defect. IR blaster is not working on my redmi 8a dual since day one. One irritating this that MI asks permission to store data and track for almost everything we use on this phone. Would rate it ok purchase as I got for only 3000 in exchange of my old phone.

"
"

  Simple smartphone, but Good Smartphone! Camera average but included PRO mode, Battery backup excellent Charged 4 days ago. Used normal internet and Dual 4G native video calling and WiFi Hotspot without gaming till now. Display 6'22"" good, No lag, Good face detection. Overall 9/10 but if you consider the price then it's 10/10 actually.

"
"

  Battery life is good but as it is not fast charging, it takes 3-4 hours to charge completely. It looks really good as well...and so far it's performance has been amazing. Camera is good as well. Overall it's an excellent phone in this price range.But do refer to it's YouTube review as well. All of its features and deficiencies are explained in detail there.

"
"

  In products detailed information it is mentioned, product would be made in India, but why delivered product is made in China. I know company is from China, however I thought product is getting manufactured in India. Please put correct information in product details.

"
"

  - utmost thing is battery backup- camera is too good at good light condition- low light camera is blurry- speakers are good at sound- there is double tap for screen wake- the VoWifi(Voice over WiFi) is available for selected operators- network reception is also good- phone is little bit heavy- it will good if here is LED notificationat last i would say the phone is best value phone from Xiaomi But there UI bugs are ridiculous

"
"

  Good mobile for the price you get. SD439 does the day to day job, definitely gaming is not amongst those. Camera is what you get for the price. The highlight is battery which is absolutely killer. Can easily give a screen on time of 10 plus hrs on mixed usage. Supports fast charging however only 10 watts charger is supplied in the box and,without any headphones which is understandable at this price.

"
"

  Good budget mobile for basic usage like attending online classes, listening to music, watching videos and normal browsing. The limited 2 GB RAM doesn't allow for multitasking and gaming which you obviously can't expect in a phone at this price. The features are really amazing like the p2i coating, Gorilla Glass 5 and wireless FM which makes this a strong and durable phone to have!

"
"

  Did lot of research before buying.At this budget this the best phone I found it in market. I am not big fan of redmi. But it is cost effective and good for short term use.Over all phone is okay don’t expect much .Sound quality is good.Battery life is also good.Have all the required basic features.Camera is not that great if you need good camera dont go for it.Phone is heating while charging.Go for it if it fit in your budget.Overall okay.

"
"

  Redmi 8a dual is the worst mobile in the market. The phone has serious lag issues and the home page freezes from time to time. I got a replacement after I complained about lag issues and the second piece turned out to be worst than the first. Now I am stuck with this ""brick"" of a mobile forever. After a complaint about the replacement, Amazon sent a service expert who was unaware of my phone's problem. He came, he saw, he yelled, he blabbered and left telling that the phone is fine according to him and that I have 365 days time to keep visiting the Mi service centre day after day.

"
"

  It’s just not worth the money. I have used MI phones earlier and they work fine but this one is useless.1) it’s very slow and if you open multiple app at a time the phone will hang2) Even opening YouTube application on this phone takes close to 8-10 seconds3) Battery is very and will last appx 1 day with normal usage4) lot of ads pop up which is irritating5) Camera is very bad , My earlier MI 5A takes better pictures than this phoneOverall very unhappy with this product.I have been using this since 10 days now.

"
"

  I returned this the third day after delivery.It hanged in my very first use LOL !•Camera is below average.•Processes is average.•It does not have fingerprint reader.•• Hangs when you record video using Snapchat & WhatsApp. (third party apps)Honestly, Even in Rs.8999, you can get much much much much better experience!AND I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

"
"

  There is one feature of this phone wherein we can tab three times on screen to see zoom view; when I enabled that, I found lagging issue with phone and also screen got freeze some times, with this option face diffuculty to dial a phone when we need to type like 9998 it's my own number series,Camera performance disappoint me; in day lite it's Ok, I can say average, and in night compete zero..""0"", and color capturing is also not good.I am happy with design, that gives rich look, touch is smooth, also allows to delete preinstalled games & other application.It's okay with this price and No cost EMI option.Thank you

"
"

  The phone got slow after one week use, i wanted to replace but the replace window is closed. Camera & battery are average, It's not like 13MP & 5000Mah. The device is not suitable to play any game even ludo, it's started lagging when you open ludo and after shut any from your app your home display become blank for few seconds ...........Worst experience.Dear Amazon team, please help to replace the device.

"
"

  Rear camera quality is below average, main problem is with auto focus, camera is struggling to focus on objects.Wireless display feature problem, wireless display is frequently disconnected with Smart TV.OS become unstable sometimes, need to reboot is the only option to recover the phone.Failed to upgarde on MIUI 11, after complete download of around 2 GB, it fails to update on MIUI 11.

"
"

  निश्चित रूप से रेडमी ने अपने आप को काम कीमत में बेहतर फीचर्स एवम् क्वालिटी मोबाइल कंपनी के रूप में स्थापित किया है परन्तु कॉम्पटीशन के चक्कर में रेड़मी ने सस्ते पार्ट्स इस्तेमाल करना शुरू कर दिया है। यही वजह है कि रेडमी के फोन्स की क्वालिटी घटती जा रही है। Redmi 8a में mike की घटिया क्वालिटी इसका एक नमूना है। मै redmi 8a के 5 से भी ज्यादा फोन में वही same mike problem देख चुका हूं। Vioce क्लियर नहीं आती । Feels like old days chinese mobile phone।प्लीज खरीदने से पहले एक बार किसी भी दूसरे के मोबाइल को इस्तेमाल करके देख लें । Totally disappointed this time

  Bought the phone for my wife when her phone screen was damaged. It was on offer on Amazon at the time and for its price, it seemed like a great deal. Note that the spec says 2GB ram, 32GB storage. Being a Samsung user, i wasn't sure how the experience would be. However i am happy to report that aside from a few hitches, this phone is excellent. The 2GB may seem less but i never noticed any issue when using fb or youtube. I cannot recommend it for intensive gaming but for casual use like watching videos etc, it is fine. I havent tested the selfie cam yet but the front cam is pretty good. There is no fingerprint sensor. Even though the phone supports fast charging, there is no fast charger provided. No earphones. Basically just the phone and regular charger. Ensure you remove the preinstalled bloatware and banned chinese software. Finally an excellent 5000 mAh battery that lasts almost a whole day on active use. All in all, a phone perfect for the casual user.

"
"

  Ordered it for my mother. Good phone for her but for average user it is not that good.Cons:Phone keep hanging if multitasking done like opening of 2 or more apps at same time.Battery life is also not so good.Built Quality and finishing is not good.Pros:SnapDragon processor at this range.Handy phone.

"
"

  Nice phone, as expected. Only negative side is that it belongs to a Chinese company and a part of our payment will reach the Chinese (though made in India).Only Sub 10K price range phone with snapdragon processor and 64GB phone memory.Phone don't have fingerprint unlock, but have face unlock.Battery lasts for 2 days for average normal use (calls, social media and youtube, without gaming)Camera also good, with decent portrait mode with background blur and all the gimmicks.All in all a good budeget phone.Still i am a little upset that i supported the Chinese (even though indirectly)

"
"

  First I ordered this mobile on 6th July and got it on 9th july(2020). There was 3.5 mm jack issue with this mobile and I ordered for it's return.Again I got a new mobile on 13th July but I can return my mobile till 20th July.On 22nd July I faced another issues with this new mobile. Apps opening and closing itself. Nither I can close my app nor I can switch off mobile. For example if I'm surfing fb then it suddenly get closed and suddenly open. Even mobile automatically start typing in comment box.So I just want to tell you pls don't go for this mobile.

  I purchased this product only cause my one plus was broke and I couldn’t get it repaired on time. I needed a spare phone for emergencies and I bought this product considering the cost factor. I’ve never used any of RedMi products and since RedMi claim that they are the products for cost I wanted to give it a try. As I expected, it’s the worst performance phone. I’m not talking about the performance equal to a premium smartphone. I’m talking about basic use. The touch is worse. It taps automatically and makes the usage of phone a nightmare. Have to restart it multiple times to fix that issue temporarily. U never know when the same error occurs. Other than that, major thing is “THE DEVICE TURNS OFF ALL OF SUDDEN FROM NOWHERE AND WONT TURN ON AT ANY COST”. Nobody knows why that happened and will have to factory reset the device from device factory mode. Will never buy any of the RedMi products just because of price. I’d rather get a good quality product even if I have to pay a little more money.I’d not recommend at all be it any product coming from this company.

  Lots of useless manufacturer and google apps. You open the box and it feels like you're using someone else's phone. Additionally, they cant be uninstalled. Hogs up 14 GB of 32 GB space and you're left with only 18 GBs. And if you're using two sims you cant even insert a memory card to store pics/music or whatever.Ads everywhere! You open any of their apps, even the system apps, and adds are there to greet you.Does not come with a fingerprint senser.Battery life is decent but lets see how it works 6 months from now.Has an ugly(imo) screen tint as default. And for some reason, every time I restart I have to set the tint and turn off auto-brightness all over again.  Idk if it's a fault or I am not doing it right.Screen guard and back cover not included in the box as is the norm with some other manufacturers.Comparing it with Honor 8c which I bought last year for roughly the same price (8.3k), this phone's resolution is massively inferior to Honor's even though they both claim it to be 720 x 1520 pixels.Very disappointed and underwhelmed with this purchase. Only keeping it because it was the cheapest phone (among newer releases) in the 32gb/3gb category on amazon. You save your money to buy an entry level phone and still it doesn't feel personalised. Fed up with these proprietary devices. Linux mobile distros cant come soon enough.

  Worst phone I have ever purchased...3 gb ram but lags a lot on full version kine master and other designing apps other. I have tried the trial on two mi 8 phones pic attached of both.. Samsung and Huawei phones with 3 gb are best it was my first mi phone and I m disappointed with this phone. I was using huawei and Samsung 3 gb ram varient and are best till date after more than 2 years of rugged usage. Even micromax 4311 3gb ram is faster than miI suggest to go for Samsung. mi is best for those who have not used Samsung and huawei(including honor) ram and battery management is best in Samsung, micromax and huawei

  Redmi 8a dual is a balanced phone in its price rangeAdvantages...1. Processor is SD2. Display3.build quality4. battery life5. Face unlock6. Type c charging fast chargingDisadvantages...1. Front and rear camera quality is not up to the mark. It is slightly below avg quality. I hope redmi can fix it by software update.2. Picture stabilization is not up to the mark.3. Sound quality should be given slightly better.4. I have big issue with interface miui. There are a lot of adds.5. Some deadly apps come with pre installed. Those garbages should be removed by software update.Overall if you are looking for a low budget phone for your parents usage purpose or child's study purpose, this is the right one battery is larger, processor is good for day to day life usage and display is much better. Face unlock is fast. But redmi should Remove the garbage apps. Overall 4.5 star for the phone below 8k.

   I dislike the phone because fingerprint reader so poor that after few times it start becomes blur and screen got shake automatically and poor camera quality. My money goes in vain totally rubbish product. Do not buy any chinese because two of my chinese phone working very worst. I am not lying please see the image and video I have uploaded.

"
"

  It's a little hard to use with one hand, and the keyboard doesn't seem to have one-handed mode, but the split screen feature and the screen brightness make up for that. This is the first smartphone I've used where the minimum brightness is satisfactory for use in a dark room. The dark mode and reading mode options are quite helpful, too. The screen is also resistant to damage, to a certain extent. The battery cannot be removed, but there seems to be a fair amount of ingress protection because of that. Lastly, it comes with its own USB-C charging cable, which is a little short but charges well enough.

  I have ordered this product on September 1 and got it on sep 3. After 3 days ,the display stops it's working. The image in these display are now show as multiple images and are floating most of the time. Not even able to read atleast a word properly.Some times it seems normal but most of the time they are not working. I have brought this for my siblings for attending online classes. But this product is absolutely useless. My all other phones are brought from Flipkart and other sites. But none of them are of this kind. All of them are working properly. I thought that the product from Amazon might be having better quality than other sites,but now I think that I was wrong. I lost believe in Amazon. I have contacted the customer service and they told that service exicutive will inspect the phone and then only they can proceed. But I think this is not fair because the executive will reach to my house after two days and after inspection they will decide what to do. I need refund for this item, I will brought product of another company from somewhere else. Or I will file a case in consumer court for this issue against MI and Amazon India for cheating me. I have discussed this with an advocate.

"

  It is a basic phone ... If you have money add 2k or 4k and opt for another model.( Phone supports manily  for children and elder parent )Redmi note 8 or pocco m2* Positives *Best at 7.5k* Excellet battery* Good display* Use for online class* Negative ** No finger print ( but at this price range exceptional )* Camera is biggest issue.. I have expected more from rear cam..* Little bit of hang at 2gb ram , go for 3 gb ram ...* Cannot use for hard, not a gaming phone..

  I bought this product with exchange, exchanged with old redmi 5. The pick up guy verified the mobile in and out and picked up from home. Surprisingly after one day he called and said glass is broken which we never noticed. And am sure it was not. We cant say what he did in 1 day with mobile. Now asking to return. It is not acceptable, i do not know wht all he did with mobile. If it was broken he could have rejected during pick up. This what i do not like..

"
"

  Phone is a good option in this range.It lacks fingerprint scanner. Camera quality is not so good. It is a very heavy phone,  difficult to keep itnin hands id you are using it for long while lying in bed. But it is worth buying.It has made in india sticker also,  not sure if it is real.

"
"

  At first glance I was happiest person to have bought this phone at Rs 7499  (2GB Ram, 32 GB internal memory). The joy was, however, short lived. The charger failed to work. Went for return option but customer executive suggested a test via Blancco App. Done. Thereafter, he assigned a technician to visit my place and inspect the phone. Alas, the technician didn't turn up nor did he respond to call. In the meantime, phone frequently began to hang and misbehave. As of now I am cursing my fate. It is worst ever phone i have come across. Don't waste your money. You will repent the decision to buy this phone. Please take my advice seriously. This Redmi 8A dual phone will turn your face red with anger...

  I have  purchased this mobile on 25 July and within seven days mobile Battery is draining very fast. I want to return this faulty mobile. But return window is closed .Amazon can help in this

  I've been using Xiaomis product from Its Note 4 launch and was satisfied by its performance as well as its manufacturing in India as all the box contains information that it is MADE IN INDIA but this was the 1st time i bought this phone and it doesnt have that MADE IN INDIA logo and it's clearly written over there on the phone that it's MADE IN CHINA😠 I've not expected this from #Redmi_India that they cannot afford a budget segment phones manufacturing in their own country 🤧🤕

"
"

  It has a problem. Of getting auto boot since day one.....recently it flashed with Android 10.....and since then it shuts down auto and it takes very firm press on the power button to boot.....and when u are doing this after every 2 hrs then quite a fun.....I will never buy MI product in my life......it was first n last time I did.....these cheap Chinese re-incarnation claiming to be made in India. .....I really don't believe with the quality it's packed with.....

"
"

  At the budget I didn't have any other choice. So bought this phone, totally a killer.Cons - signal reception not good and no fingerprint scanner.Pros - display and battery is awesome.I had issues with battery backup atfirst later on I turned off may things, which was automatically running in background. Now the battery is unbelievably good, mom is totally Happy with it.

"
"

  At this price range this is a good buy. The phone looks elegant and sleek.The camera is good outdoors in sunlight but in dark spaces it does not perform well. Again at this price it is worth it.The Ad ridden OS is a bit irritating but once the warranty is void one can install custom ROM.It is easy to handle and carry and the does not feel heavy even with the 5k battery.Did not face any overheating issues so far.I never play games so have nothing to comment on that front.Screen clarity is good and brightness in sunlight is also not an issue (I use dark mode)Overall a good buy but in a month or so you may get better models.

"
"

  I've used many phones in this budget segment from renowned brands. I was always skeptical about Redmi/Xiaomi. It was hard to make a decision of buying this phone. But to be honest, I'm totally moved! Be it the display, be it looks, usage, it is totally a power package. The amazing thing is, you're getting 5000 MAH battery in less than 8k ! Easily runs over 1.5 days with a full charge and average usage (multitasking, video streaming, browsing, social media). It also comes with 18W Fast Charging support. The display will blow your mind. Looks are quite good, could've been better. What is a drawback is it doesn't have a Fingerprint Sensor, which is a must for phones in this budget! Camera quality is ""just okay"".Lastly, I'm using this device for the last 4-5 days, didn't feel any lag though it comes with 2GB RAM, all credits to Redmi's amazing optimisation.You can go for it without a single doubt in your mind if your budget is right.

  Very bad experience, just after 20 days, it is not working properly. Many times while using this ohone, it automatically closes all the apps and returns to home screen and then it just hangs and then we have to restart it to make it work again.

"
"

  I am using 2gb/32gb variant(white). Using it since 16 days and have not found a problem yet... No hanging/lagging...i have downloaded games of 250-300 mb and played it... The result was fantastic and neither it hanged nor became hot while playing or charging... Speaker sound is pretty good and Camera quality is superb in good lighting conditions mainly during day time (outdoors), no one can say it's a 8k below phone by looking it's camera performance due to SD processor and battery backup is good too....Conclusion:- This phone is for people who are not game addict and those who love photography but are know in budget... The phone performance is lag free for day to day usage and most importantly uninstall or disable the preloaded apps if you don't use it.

  The modem of this phone is very slow. It gives only half the actual speed. My other phone gives a speed of 90mbps on wifi whereas this phone give only 40 mbps on same network. Getting less than 1 mbps on LTE networks. Camera is below average.

"
"

  Don't go for this phone unless your budget is very low.This phone doesn't have aby fingerprint scanner. Fast charger doesn't come in the box.Neither comes a back case or screen protector or headphone. You have to buy all those separately.Camera quality is also not good.My suggestion is to spend 1-2k extra and go for other good phones.

  I would like to start with prosPros:1. After unboxing, the first feel and look is awesome. The aura x grip design on the back of the device is superb considering its price range which gives a premium feel while you are holding the device in your hands.2. The big 6.22 inch ips lcd display of resolution 720x1520. The viewing angles are good and comes with support of sunlight display which mean in outdoors one will not have a problem viewing this device. Due to its large screen content consuming is very good and the dot notch in the top middle of the screen does not annoy while watching videos or playing games. The display also comes with gorilla glass 5 protection which is very rare in this price segment and protects your device to some extent from scratches and drops.3. This device comes with p2i nano coating which means it can save the device from splashes of water to a certain extent. But do not dip it in water as it is not water resistant.4. This device comes with snapdragon 439 processor which is based on 12nm process. This chipset can go up to 2ghz and performs day to day task and gaming easily. Pubg lite and pubg mobile runs smoothly on this device. Pubg lite can go up to a maximum resolution of balanced at very high frame rates whereas pung mobile can go upto balanced with medium frame rates. Both games run smoothly without any lag or stutter.5. This device is powered by a 5000mah battery which gives a backup of upto 2 dys on average usage. But for heavy gamers and content viewers this device gives backup of upto a day on single charge. This device comes with 10ww charge and if you charge with 10w charger it takes around 2hr 30min but if you charge it by 18w charger it takes around 2hr.6. The camera on the back is 13+2 mp AI dual camera. The ai scene detection is good and fast. The backgroung blur during portrait mode is very good and the selfie camera is 8mp ai camera. This also support portrait mode but the blur could have been better. Both camera support 1080p recording at 30fps.7. Comes with face unlock and is pretty fast with proper lighting condition.Cons:1. The cameras could have been better.2. IR blaster is missing.3. Notification Led is missing.4. Fingerprint reader is missing.5. Both cameras struggles in low light conditions.6. Comes with miui with full of bloatwares and ads. But they can be disabled and and stopped.WARNING: For non chinese smartphone users if you buy this phone it will com with pre installed chinese apps banned by Indian government bu they will fix it with an ota update so not worry.My Opinion:After using this device I would recommend this device to buyers with budget under 10,000. Everything is good and the updates are also quick and timely. And no problem with the device.

  After 1 week of usage:Nice battery backup (5000 mah)Nice display qualityGood soundNice camera quality in this budget.Big displayFace lock available however no fingerprint scanner.As said on the box it support wireless FM but it doesn't support wireless FM you need to connect your headphone for FM frequency.Support Fast charging which is very useful thing.Overall nice phone to buy.Thanks to Amazon for the exchange offer.

  Got my new redmi phone. Overall the phone is as per the features, but the quality of camera is not as per the advertisment, selfie camera is better than back camera, you can understand how the back camera is,  previously had Samsung phone with same mega pixel camera, it clicked so well, so here is the sincere request to all buyers, if looking for good camera, don't go for it,

"
"

  this is a good smartphone which comes with the USB Type C, 5000mah Battery, Good Vivid Screen, Gorilla Glass 5 Protection ,Good Camera Dual rear Camera (13mp+2mp), 8mnp selfie camera which u don't find under other smartphones of  this Budget segment  to be noted do not compare with other high budget smartphones camera ABOVE 10Kand in the last latest android 10 update Released in india & latest MIUI 12 is on its way in next month2GB variant performs well  Ram remains all the time under 60% usageThis is Good Buck Performs and Give features u cannot find in other smartphones , and other smartphones which are available i'm sure they are under preform as per the new smartphones of Redmi 9A, Redmi 9 they even also not has these features and comes with the DOWNGRADED REBRANDED PROCESSOR

"

  From a budget mobile battery backup and call quality are expected, call quality is pathetic, mic not clear, other party most of the times say that my audio is not clear. Further, earpiece volume is not loud and clear, I am not a power user, just some calls where it frustrated me and some youtube that's it, battery backup is good but what is the use of advancement in technology when it is not performing it's basic task, MI if listening provide good mic, speakers and earpiece for an overall good experience,

"
"

  I expected a little more performance from a redmi phone. It has the typical problems of a 2 GB RAM phone. Really slow. I bought it for my mother. For her use it is just ok. For better performance, a minimum 4 GB RAM phone is needed, no matter which brand you select.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my Father and generally preferred type c charging port which is provided by this 8000 rupee phone , although it has old processor but i must say optimization is good and also look of this is just awesome (not feel like cheap phone).Only draw back is miui which tons of ad but i find a solution to remove unnecessary apps which send anonymous notification.

"
"

  It have sturdy Build Quality . corned with gorilla glass 5 and The display quality is Good.Pros :-Nice Build Quality 10/10Good Camera (both front and back)8/10Smooth performance 9/10Face unlock is pretty fast ( never expected that ) 10/10Good for Mid end gaming 8/10Battery is an absolute monster 10/10Nice display 8/10USB C + fast chasrging 10/10Cons  :-No Finger print censorMy Rating is 8.5/10

"
"

  I don't like this.This is not a good product, I'm huge fan of redmi mobiles,i had also used the phone of this company and that was awesome but this is not good.I will just give only one 🌟 because the phone is not working properly and it is hanging

"
"

  When it comes to budget mobile phones with latest features u cant go wrong with Xiaomi phones. This model is  one such example. You get Good battery, Gorilla screen, big screen size (very big so some 1) etc. Overall value for money!

"
"

  I use this phone more than 5 months I buy it on 4 march 2020 this phone is very very nice 😊👍 in my favor because I buy this phone for my father and it is very easy to use for him and but i brought this phone at range of 6999 rupee and also I see that phone is not lagging and not get heated 🔥  and camera of phone is also niceBut 1 mistake is that his AI screen lock 🔐 not ❌ get open in Instantely but overall this phone cames with 24 hour battery life if you check this phone in volt 📞 and sync and volt to use without power savingBut i see this phone price is geeted increase from 6999++ that shocking for this phone love for people and for peoplepeople and i also play PUBG in a starting months to check the phone performance which is ossom his all sensor almost Avery was working but i don't play now because it my father's mobile 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯

"
"

  Best mobile in this budget, Great battery backup...Just once when mobile received, Pls Go in to settings - Accessibility - OFF will be done.Not any problem shown till now, I purchased this mobile 3 Qty for me - my sister - mh wife. (By different ID's)Not a single problem shoen till now.

"
"

   Hii Everyone...I received this phone in a brand new condition.Everything was fine but there is a technical issue in the software or might be in display....When i used this phone on the very first day i did not notice this error.But next day i saw this fault.The display of the phone was getting hang sometimes...Pixels was bursting also...And there were some glitches on the display when i was using it.So i returned this phone. You may also see the pictures and video which i attached here.It might be a technical error.Otherwise Packaging was good.I received this product too early.It was not a seller's fault.Amazon also refunded the total amount.Thank you Amazon.

"
"

  There is no finger print point,. Camera quality is very cheap & poor even 5000/- phone has better camera. If single camera is better, no need of such dual camera. XIAOMI just making fool. Screen is so so. Battery is good. Overall just 5 yrs back quality.

"
"

  All good, as per the cost, eveey this is appropriate but it could have the fingerprint scanner. Processor and ram is okay for this price... No over heating issue. Good and smooth running. Can play Cod or pubg in medium settings. Battery is okay.. 5 watt charger in the box,, but it supports 18 watt fast chaeger, at this price, in box 5 watt charger is okay but if it could come, it shall be a best option because battery is big 5000 mah. No back cover. All redmk phns come with a back cover. But this is exceptional in this phone. All over 7 out of 10. Performance is excellent but accessories could have been upgraded in the box.

"
"

  Firstly 5 stars to Amazon for delivery this mobile phone with in 24 hours.Coming to this mobile phone, my first impressions are it is working good and I liked it's display.  Especially this low budget phone has Vowifi ( Wifi calling ) feature.  Camera is not good ( don't except much for this low price).  Still review under progress.

"
"

  Nice phone in this price range except bit big to handle . I personally recommend not go for this screen size, as it is very difficult to handle or pick call using one hand (mostly during driving or doing some other work). it is quite slippery, so you land up with cover which makes it too big to keep it in pocket.

"
"

  This review is for REDMI 8A DUAL 3GB RAM 32GB ROM(for use 21gb)Nice budget product. Large battery life last 1-2days. Camera is of average quality. Dual 4g standby. Charger given is of 10 watt. Type c port otg support. No fingerprint . Has face unlock. No ir blaster. Good sound and its quality. Sim tray is risky to use very delicate. Very less heating if you use it continuous

"
"

  Not really value for money, a lot of bloatware comes pre-installed even in October 2020, many ads, faltu apps like hago, Zilli, etc. Are automatically installed within 24 to 48 hours of usage. xiaomi is cheating on everyone by showing they didn't give installed app but they automatically install it from their storage later. For specs you should go for other company phone this is overpriced by ₹500.Camera Quality is not even of 5MP. And front camera just exist for name. Once you see the quality you would not use it again

"
"

  Good phone and value for money, good at memory 3GB.. good response time, speed compared to other android phone with 3GB, may be its new 😊, if you have MI TV, screen mirroring is excellent on the full HD VIEW AND SOUND QUALITY. There’s no delay in streaming at allI bought it for online classes for my kid to use “teams” and “zoom” app streaming on big screen for better view and sound qualityAnd since a month the quality of speed and battery backup is good

"
"

  Thanks Amazon for being care full about your costumer products quality and delivery........ So i am writing an 30day long review.......... Redmi 8a dual is an such an nise phone...... I order it on colour white and ran 2gb rom32gb..... But i could not found any problem with this smartphone .......... I charge this phone for an 2houres just and it's chargeing is 👌👌👌👌very fast .,......... I am an free fire lover and I can easily play free, on this device........ I couldn't see any problem on this device camera quality is also good..,. I suggest all costumer go for....

"
"

  After using 10 days I'm writing this review, camera quality is very poor, display average, phone speed is okay, battery backup is very good, but charging time takes 3 hours, for old age people this phone is good not for youngsters

"
"

  Pretty Much Bang for The Buck if you are on a budget . You know the specs go for it . Don't expect higher performance on this budget . According to the budget Mi is delivering the best value .Now if you have some sentimental ego about Made In India products then my friend go and buy a Banana and pretend you are using a smartphone .Thank You.

"
"

  Budget phone for people who are looking to buy their 1st smart phone in life. I bought it for my mother and she is happy with it. Serves the purpose of a first time smart phone user very well. Ordered grey colour.. looks nice tooFace recognition works only in best light. Not counting it as a negative since it is not a must feature. Camera quality is good ( expect what you will get at this price)

"
"

  It was a good phone though it hs 2 BG ram but it looks was pretty good n battery was aswme whch was 5000 not even we get in othr top models and evn the fingerprint sensor r good but if u r buying thn buy wid 3gb or with 4gb wil more bettr

"
"

  Iam giving this review more than one month usage yesterday the phone have been dropped in to more than 6 feet depth water tank with in some minutes we took the phone nothing happened to the phone its working normally just we cleaned the phone that to after taking my phone from the water it didn't even turn off and perfomance wise its simplicity good for this budget this phone is more than enough

"
"

  On This Price Range Redmi 8A Dual, is best.I brought Sea blue colour smart phone grippy disign 👌. Redmi 8A Dual is best for biginners.Best camera smart phone under 8k.Main camera 13mp 👌,  secondery camera 2mp depth sensor.👍Front camera : average , It's not clicks quality pictures.👎Battery 5000 mAh : normal use 2 - 3 days battery backup.👌Display : average Lcd display.👍But display disign is superb water drop notch display.face unlock is normal but medium fast but good.Best stylish smartphone under this price thanks to Xiaomi.

"
"

  Good battery, just decent processor, can play pubg mobile only with lowest graphics only, if you want a satisfyingly smooth gaming experience, but for all other uses rather than huge games, it's best buy for this money except for moto g8 lite.

"
"

  If u want to buy a phone with ₹7000 budget this is the best phone....Awesome battery life .....speakers are good ....coming to camera I give 3.5/5...not too bad or not too good ...but money worthy

"
"

   1) Product is good but unforunately I have received this product where its Power key button not working, when i have pressed power button it shows FastBoot image logo , then again i pressed power button then it has been started.2) Also its Volume down key not working only upper key working.3) I have Taken Volume Key Button Vedio for your reference.4) If Possible contact with us because I need replacement not a refund, But when sending new device kindly check on your end all features and all physical accesseries (Like Button, Battery,Charger are in good condition i.e working properly)

"
"

  Really very nice and looks for this mobile but unfortunately thee mobile is not charging up. After contacting the customer care and they did test using the blancoo diagnostic app and confirmed the same. I have asked the replacement for this mobile but they are stated as this is service not possible & refunded the amount.Now I'm looking foe the new mobiles like redmi 9 but not able to place the order while flash sale time.

"
"

  Great value for moneyGreat battery lifeDoesn't hang in day to day tasksType c port with support for 18 watt chargingScreen is good for its priceCamera takes good pictures in day light but in artificial light and low light the quality is trash

"
"

  Very bad product, delivered on 12th July 2020 and I'm writing this review on 1st August 2020, the phone hanged, no app is opening, after restarting also same problem, I brought it for online studies now have to give it in service centre , very bad experience with this phone, recommend not to buy it for anyone.

"
"

  Please dond buy this...one of the worst mobile.keeps disconnected to the network and internet speed was very bad..same sim is working well in other mobile..When I purchased it was 7k,,that itself i felt wated money..Now they increased to 8200,,I dont know what makes it worth..Please dont buy this...

"
"

  Phone hangs and it behaves what ever way it want example it open wats app nd  clicks on Send nd send nd send... Without human intervention I am wondering did I bought mobile or Robot which is frustrated

"
"

  Thanx to Amazon for its fast delivery, in just 2 days..I love shopping on Amazon.One of the best phones under 9K.Redmi has proved its worth..a very good one for daily usage of social media apps like YouTube, Facebook, instagram, etc.. camera & audio quality is also very good..Also games can be played, design & midnight Black colour is simply awesome..Very good as of now I'll update after 1 month.

"
"

  If you are facing problems with the phone accessories, they do not consider it as a problem. If you want to return, they won't allow to do that. They just give chance for replacement and the replaced product may come even worse than before.The Adapter gets heated like a hair-straighter within 10 mins. I asked for a technician and they provided one after 3 weeks. I had to order replacement and the replaced product came even worse. The phone itself started heating along with the defective adapter.

"
"

  It is very initial review based on 3 days usage.First review for Amazon: Excellent experience with Amazon till date. Wonderful buying and up-to-date delivery by Amazon. Thanks.Now mobile: I purchased this redme phone for my wife by looking her usage. Handset is perfect for her and working as per the expectations. Detailed review will write after 3 months.

"
"

  1) Product- Product is good, value for money and handy.2) Delivery- Best delivery experience. Many times on time delivery followed.3) Service- Better service provided by Amazon and product seller. Nice...Keep It Up...Thanks to Amazon...

"
"

   Power button not working properly hence returned. Screen guard ordered separately there is return option. Amazon team i hope will help in this case.

"
"

  Nice phone good in 6.499 is realy nice but not so fast working when open lock it will take 4 to 5 I have to swipe than is open why this happen I don't know  n other things is battery drain fast just in 5000 mh so with use 12hr net than almost 1 day only

"
"

  Product is some what ok. Because my sister needed in this price. Seller APPARIO package is very worst. I give 1 star to seller. Just packed with cover.  No care. Worst packaging.

"
"

  Nice phone!!!In every segment it's best. display n camera quality is not very good,but in Rs-7499 price point it's worthy...  Specially it's back side texture n Redmi branding on frontDiL Le Liya yaar !!!!

"
"

  Superb phone at this budget and excellent value for money plus all the features built in with the latest version of technology and software, the only thing is that it is without finger print sensor, but at this budget it is acceptable. 👍👌

"
"

  Pathetic mobile phone in cheaper price. They are not only accepting return the phone but also denying to replace it. Still I'm keep on talking to their technician and they are doing their practicals on that mobile phone by requesting to install other app, switching on and off, updating software. I'm so exhausted now with the Amazon service. I had so much trust on Amazon now their representatives and technicians are forcing me not to believe in Amazon anymore.

"
"

  My Experience is...Do not buy 2 GB Variant mobile as now days most of latest mobile run on Andorid 10 which need minimum 3 GB to run all application smoothly. while i am using app its lack many time.. Sometimes its crashes.. its a worst experience when you are using New Mobile and it doesn't meet minimum Expectation..Don't Expect Good Selfie camera,  Overall mobile is Good.Its support Fast charging is quiet nice feature given in this Price price range.Pls buy Min. 3 GB Ram Variant

"
"

  As per add, it was 10v charger along with the box, but in box it was 5V charger...Due to this wrong charger it is taking over 3 hours to charge 100%.... Also this charge is getting drain before Eod..Absolutely unhappy..So I would suggest, pls pay extra and go for a better mobile than this low end models....

"
"

  I purchased mobile Redmi 8A Dual from Amazon, After one month mobile is auto shut many times.Whenever call is received phone goes auto switch & auto shut.Battery is also not good, discharge within 12 hours.

"
"

  Screen is LCD, not vibrant at all. Contains lot of bloat ware. One thing I liked are the alert tones. Better buy Samsung galaxy m series. This phone is good for gifting... Gifting parents or dumb girlfriends

"
"

  it's a very good product in the market at a reasonable and affordable price.  i had purchased it for my kids for online classes and it is serving the purpose very well.it's 5000 mah battery is good. overall its a best buy.

"
"

  It seems i received a defective piece and now after the purchase of 10 days the mobile works automatically ... When I call amazon they are saying return policy is over and they cannot do anything... It really lack of services and amazon should take action on this because they are the one delivering the product.. Really disappointed and helpless ...

"
"

  I previously gifted it to one of my girlfriends. Now I bought again for another girlfriend because all are equal to me. The phone is good because it has a good battery backup time and good performance. But only disappointed me because it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor. I compared the phone with my Galaxy S10 lite and found a huge difference. From the display to the performance, all feacher in the S10 lite is awesome.

"
"

  Overall, the product is as described except the charger, only a 10W charger is included in the box.I think the handset is bit heavy though I have not checked the weight of handsets of other brands in this price range.I will write a detailed review after using it for some time.

"
"

  Seems like software problems with deviceVery bad experience i had with mi really disappointed. Customer care not responding don't know what should i do now.. Request to amazon please find some way..

"
"

  Best in this segment in terms of battery life and other features. don't have IR blaster, camera is average. keep min 1GB RAM space empty to run high end games Turbo game booster option do the job.Need to see in the long run.

"
"

  Phone is okay, basic phone with 2gb, smooth UI, but I remember xiaomi came up with 5a it was smaller and weigh lesser than this. I purchased this phone for my dad, its too heavy and slips a lot other than that it's okay.

"
"

  The phone was bought for the daughter of an employee to attend online classes. She is extremely happy and able to attend online classes.hence the purpose & objective for purchase has been fulfilled.

"
"

  Product is all-over good but it will be helpful if seller provide the tax invoice or purchase bill in some hard printing material. It will be useful in future to us.

"
"

  This product is very good.But after 20 days the phone was 1st time hang.Now it takes almost 3 hour to be fully charged.Sometime the touch screen is not responding,after restart it works normally.Due to lockdown and current situation I can't go to the nearest service centre.So I am very upset.Please advice me what I should do.

"
"

  There's no fingerprint reader, it would be good if they'd have mentioned it, but i gotta say that I'm amazed by the face recognition reader, it's a lightweight gigantic phone with powerful processor.For the budget, it's a worth buying. Just go for it!!!PS - I just received it so wait for the further update.

"
"

  Bigger battery, nice processor, good camera. Budget phone in this price segment. It's quite ok for the daily staff. The build quality and the back panel is the main highlights. But quite disappointed that no back cover is in with phone.

"
"

  Just a couple of days latter, the phone started behaving abnormally. Application would open on their own randomly. Seemed liked some spot on the touch screen remain pressed and it kept opening up apps. Had to reboot it everytime to sort this out.The phone otherwise works smooth. But this above problem has occurred a multiple of time which has soured my experience.

"
"

  I have not tested the Mobile couz its a gift.But hats off to Xiaomi for bringing phones in this price point with so much specifications.Its a high time for Non-Chinese brands do something or loose the market to China !!

"
"

  Phone quality is good and battery life is also good ..in this range 7499 ... 5000 mah battery and dual camera all are best...Bt only a thing there is no finger print...... Only face lock.. bt it's okkk...It's best phone......

"
"

  This is my 3rd Redmi Phone. I had Redmi 2, Redmi 4, and this is my Redmi 8A Dual. The only drawback what Noticed is Finger Print Missing. I have  lots of apps which require authentication. In my Redmi 4 I had finger print So I unlocked easily all my apps without entering the password / PIN. But in Redmi 8A Dual, I have to manually enter all those keys. Its really pathetic sometime. But other than that I didn't found any other brand who is offering  3GB 64GB for Rs 8999.

"
"

  Superb Phone. Value for Money. MI is always a trusted brand in India. Excellent battery life, faster processorfor general use,  good call quality,  Camera is also good. Go for it guys. At this price level, no other phone can beat this phone

"
"

  Awesome battery backup...Best camera in this price ..Processor is working good not best above average..Overall best in price...

"
"

  wifi, every 1min disconnects even from 1mtr of router. Raised a complain. Service centre told factory reset. First time facing Such issue. Xiomi you Just lost a customer.Don't want visit considering current covid and  also stories from xiomi services.I gave video, log every thing to them. As I also work in Mobil domain, i know it is defect which they should know.before.

"
"

  It is a good phone and value for money. But itsCamera is not very good.It has high perfomance and great battery capacity.But it has no fingerprint lock system. The phone is very smooth and it has several other quality. The phone can duplicate one app to double.all over it is a good and value for money.I like the product because it is smooth,high battery perfomance and high phone performance

"
"

  Worst product. But more disappointing is Amazon service. The phone started malfunctioning after a few days. First it started hanging and then began off and on all on a sudden.  The problem started just before an hour of scheduled replacement. Initially I thought it is a temporary problem. But when I discovered that the problem is permanent I tried for replacement. But the return window had closed just 5 minutes earlier. Because of 5 minutes delay Amazon didn't care for my repeated request.

"
"

  When package arrived , got feared like this could be dummy item (junk) by the way it was packed , inside box edge was scrapped , In order to be safety measure , started recording for opening the box , phone was fine for price paid , packaging skills need to be improved by the retailer , when it travels long distance ,packaging matters all on the product.

"
"

  I am facing the screen flickering while using ICICI Mobile banking. is there anyone who is facing the same problem.and any guideline to solve this .so many unuseful apps are available.unable to disable like stock Android...better to go with stock android phone

"
"

  The phone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner but then again with this price range, I did not expect it to have one. Battery life is really good. Even with the dual camera, the quality of pictures suuck really bad. Using Instagram for pictures will help on this device. The 2 GB ram is not at all sufficient for a smartphone these days. If you're shifting from one app to another, the phone lags. Even when you back to home screen after heavy usage of any app, it lags.

"
"

  Nice product with good battery life.For normal use,browsing, you tube, and other uses it is good choice.Redmi mobile are value for money. In affordable prices you get much more.

"
"

  Display quality, camera quality are very poor. App icons on the screen appear hazy. I wasted my money.

"
"

  this phone is very very e nice and mid range is super best value for money phone redmi 8a dualthis phone in battery super charger super display sound quality superb but camera very very badspecial thank you For MI India and Amazon all team very very very thank youthis phone mid range very nice price and me e recommended this phone purchase you all of you

"
"

  This is a basic notch smart phone.... Good for middleaged useres or normal basic user...Front camera is good but rear camera is not that much good... but good for this price... Battery life is so good... but no fast charging... And finger print scanner( may be u will not get  finger print  with any phone in this price range )...  Bought it for my uncle... Look wise its soooo beautiful... Processor nad working is average

"
"

  Recently purchased a week back... Very poor battery backup... The company is claiming 5000mah... It will it is not even 2000mah....it doesnt even last for more then 6hrs...withour even usage... Very poor product... Please dont purchase mi products... Worst

"
"

  Its so worse that when product performance is not good there is NO OPTION TO RETURN. I couldn't even place return order on the day it got delivered. The reason given is so stupid: ""It contains battery, so can't be returned"". Come on, expected something better atleast. Worst ever experience to me after using Amazon for 5 years.Please think twice before ordering anything valuable on Amazon. This would be my last order

"
"

  This is defective products touch automatically worked  Amazon seller cheating a customer defective products send not purchase amazon and seller apprilo seller  you purchase other site I used this products 10 day but today hang automatically  I going to xiaomi service center but not accept it is defective  I blame you fell down this mobile but not fell down this is the modus operandi cheating a customer and Amazon 10 returns period end  seller repair products send me

"
"

  The build quality seems to be good. But the performance is nowhere near what it should deliver! Hasn't even been a week and it already is showing signs of slowing down...

"
"

  MI Remote not working. I purchased Redmi MI 8A mobile phone 8 Sep then replace it again i purchased same then it arrived on 20 Sep that same mobile's MI remote not working and some other was i facing then I raised the complaint. That also replace after it mobile arrived on 4th Oct. In this mobile phone also not working MI Remote.I would like to suggest you, if you are going to use all features of MI Redmi 8A then don't go for it.

"
"

  The phone is absolutely great. I got the phone in 6550₹ in Amazon independence sale. The camera quality both rear and front is great, 5000mah battery is a great advantage with fast charging. Although the processor is old but seems to be working smooth. The phone back panel matte texture feels absolutely great.

  After 2 month phone outgoing voice not working,And customer service is Redmi not proper responce, they provide only 10 day service not 1 year serviceI recommend don't buy this phone because of customer service

"
"

  Good phone for the price paid...budget friendly for online classes for students...But be aware...I bought it thinking that XIAOMI is making phone in india...but it's actually importing it from china...and further more only replacement option is available... no return policy..

"
"

  Good phone at this price with a large display and a 13mp+2mp rear camera and a 8mp front camera a 5000mAh battery. Big drawback is the absence of finger scanner. But a good product over all.

"
"

  The phone started acting up as soon as it was turned on--the camera doesn't work (as soon as camera is turned on the screen goes dark!), the phone wouldn't ring for WhatsApp calls, the WhatsApp video call function doesn't work as the camera would make the screen go dark. Do not buy from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd--I don't know why AMAZON allows these kinds of dishonest retailers who sell defective products on their site! Very bad experience.

"
"

  Great phone in this price range with sd439, battery life is good , it comes with C type charging facility it is a good pointPurchase only for basic use not for gaming.

"
"

  It will be in the form of brick in your hand, UI sucks to the core, still there are betterr options, face lock is a joke. the processor is way old could not handle multiple task. Does not able to support dual band in WIFI. Think before you guys buy it

"
"

  Battery is good but processor is slow work.Sounds quality is average.Wi-Fi connection is very bad. OTP generation is very bad ofter one minute late arriving OTP SMS.Finger print sensors not provide.First time users can take this phonePhone design is best👍 in blue colour.Overall good phone in this Price range if service center service is good.But I am not satisfied this phone.

"
"

  this mobile we have 3 pieces ay home, using since 8 months, and it works like a charm in all media, gaming also work without any problem. best phone in the market, USB-C is a bonus.

"
"

  Everythin is good...!!I got it @7649rs during primday sale...!!But processer is low i.e 439SDCamera is as per value of money...!!Battery is good...!!

"
"

  It is a good phone. Nice and superb in model, and long life 5000 mah battery, absolutely good for gaming. It provide full screen option and swith option is nice thing. Camera is not out standing but very good. Dual Sim, dual camera and smart face lock. Good in quality, power full glasses and smooth. Advanced features available  here. Not only is good phone but also it's helpful. Low cost but quality is very good.

"
"

  This device has great battery life.But it's volume buttons are not working properly, after a week.Full of ads.But other features are good.It has no any fingerprint sensor. As well as ""face unlock"" is very slow.Don't buy, if you are a gamer or college studend.I recommend you redmi Note 7s or 7pro, redmi Note 8 or 8 pro.This smartphone has very low RAM.which is not sufficient for a student ...(Multitasking)

"
"

  I bought this mobile for my Grandmother. As per her usage, it's quite good but when it comes to usage by me. It wouldn't meet the need. Camera quality is pretty average but it is decent as per the pricing. Battery life is good. It easily gives around two days for normal usage. It's handy and perfect for normal users overall it's a good mobile for normal users.

"
"

  Nice phone in such an economical range. Battery life and camera quality is good. Fingerprint reader is also quick and easily readable. Screen size and phone storage is also ok. What else could one get in such a price range.Nice phone for those who want in the range of below 8k.

"
"

  The phone is good for usual browsing or low end games. You can play high end games like PUBG on low settings still with a small lag. One of cons is it doesn't have a fingerprint reader but has a 2D face unlock which works fine. Camera quality is okaish, what you expect from an under 10k smartphone. Best part is its 5000 mah battery, also supports 18 W fast charging but comes with 10 W charger. Overall a good budget phone.

"
"

  Device is very good in this price. Touch is not that fast. Meets needs of basis Android well. Earphone and back cover should have been included. Sound quality is loud enough. Overall grade phone.

"
"

  Can blindly buy this mi product for the UI, looks, resolution, battery life and the economic price. We received 10% discount during the independence day sale. Cant be happier! Go for it!

"
"

  Lovely product at lowest price

"
"

  Waste of time money and energy. This Phone did not even last for 10 days

"
"

  Superb amazing phoneUnless sd 439 no heating issues not foundBattery backup is amazingBut it have 10w charger on box super phone but only it has 2 gb ram it is not enough for gamers  and also it a good phone for average user camera quality is super and face unlock is faster best battery  backup for normal users sometimes  it hang

"
"

  Redmi 8A dual is a better one but this time price is higher than normal. I purchase it Rs-8200/- which should be around 6500- 6999. Due to necessity i purchased it.

"
"

  Budget Smartphone, very good performnce, I booked for my relative. He is using it, no complaint from him. But camera littile bit dull.  Other wise great smartphone in this price. Go for it.

"
"

  I have been using Mi phones for couple of years and happy with my experience. So I blinday went for Redmile 8A dual which is really affordable with big screen long battery life and sleek design. Thanks amazon

"
"

  Phone us superb at this Price range. No phone is Better below 8k.Though it is a chinese phone but se Dont have any swadeshi phone in india. So Better to buy this phone if you have less money.Bought it @6500₹ at sale..Battery is super Awsome.. Camera is so so in this Price Its Very good.Dont think much just go fir it. You will Definatly love this Beautiful phone specialy blue one.

"
"

  The Redmi 8A phone's camera quality is stunning with long battery life. FM and sound quality are fabulous. Looks and ocean blue colour is better.The main thing easily changes with other Indian languages. No lagging for games.

"
"

  I brought this phone for my mother. The interface, sensor, camera quality is great and other features are also nice.  Easy to use.If you want a budget phone then you must go for this one.

"
"

  I am reviewing it after 2 months of usage...i will definitely say the battery life is amazing ..But the phone is lagging too much...even you cant play normal games like clash of clans, garden escapes ..also you can see so much lag while doing multitask...like whatsapp fb youtube..Camery is avg ..you cant expect great camera in this rangeBut i will suggest realme c3 ..c3 is way better than redmi 8a dual device..

"
"

  No fingerprint,. No infrared..OK but.. Given hardware is also bad.Camera worste.Sound quality is bad.2gb ram its my failure choice.Its just a phone with basic features.I don't why. Corporates finally blam customers. They want to enjoy the blood of customers to make money.Waste of money.Degraded features.

"
"

  While the phone is very good at this price, from processor and features perspective, annoyingly the charger came alongwith is pathetically slow....I had put my phone on charge for half an hour and the charge moved up just by 3%. Need a replacement of charger pls.

"
"

  Speakers are not powerful enough and call quality is poor .. returned product and got refund thanks to amazon

"
"

  No back cover, no screen guard, no fingerprint sensor, and no earphone in box, very bad camera, weak plastic backside. The screen broke after falling from 1 meter distance. I'm very unsatisfied by this phone. Also this is cheap china mobile. Avoid buying this phone. Don't waste money on this phone. Put some more money and get samsung, lg or apple mobile. You will regret after buying this phone.

"
"

  Battery is good enough. But camera is third class..camera is not as i expected in a 7500Rs. Phone. If you make call in speaker mode then the other side would not be able to hear you properly. One more..if you use few more apps then it's use to getting hang. Very disappointing..😣😣

"
"

  I was not fully confident to purchase phone on online. That too 8000 up to.. With Amazon I had a hope.. They are best and trustworthy.. Hence its proved.. .. I'm so happy..  I got sea blue. . I love the color. . Camera quality is sooo good.. Battery life is amazing.. I chargd 96 per onday before yesterday .. Yesterday full day I used my mobiles.. Today still have 38 percentage. . .im sooo satisfied with this product.. Thanku amazon

"
"

  There is no fingerprint reader but the battery life is amazing of thumping 5000mah and the camera quality is also nice with zooming capability up to 8x. Overall the phone is nice. It has a nice design and is large enough and I think it has infinity display and I think it is better than the price though I am reviewing it on the day I got it I will edit this review after 2-3 months of usage.

"
"

  Happy with the product.Look wise,function wise and battery wise this product is good and if you are looking for a decent phone for regular use then can easily go for it.It provides many features at much lower range than many others which are charging you higher for same stuff

"
"

  The phone is very good for single hand use.The screen size is perfect for watching videos.Design of the phone is also good.We r getting type C charger out of the box and it also supports fast charging.The camera quality is decent for the price range.

"
"

  Using it for last one week and performance is very bad. Can't even use the WhatsApp. Hanging regularly.

"
"

  Pros:Good Battery lifeCompact and easy to handleExcellent Design in its segmentCons:Little bit slowVerdict:If you are a basic user go for it.....If you are a gamer it will disappoint you...

"
"

  Worst product this is, hanging problem since purchase, I never thought MI phone has such quality. I never suggest anyone to buy this one. Processor is too slow.

"
"

  I would say the camera qaulity is better but not the best at this price Point. Battery is Excellent but sometimes it feels like that the battery is 4000mah and one Major problem is there is fingerprint however the face unlock is awesome all over things are Great but the price should be at 8000 not 8999 . I AM using it from 2months and there is no hang problem but android 10 update battery is running fastly

"
"

  No finger print reader.Very good battery life.Average camera( better with Google cam app than the inbuilt one).Truly worth money product in 7k range smart phones of all brands.I bought 3gb 32gb for 6999 don't know why they are now selling the same 8.3k .Any way good phone and not for high end gaming.

"
"

  The returned product has the same problem as before. Not a got phone to buy. This phone has a very slow and bad processor, it hangs or crashes ALL THE TIME. The plastic used for theconstruction of the back is very cheap. You cannot use this phone with patience or Calmness. It is a very bad phone. I do not recommend you buying this phone

"
"

   I ordered and got delivery.For first two days it worked fine. On third battery was at 10% and I opened the WhatsApp, then suddenly colored strips started appearing on screen. Not just WhatsApp, but for google also. See attached video for details.I asked  amazon for replacement but they are asking me to send it by courier in this lock down times.Pathetic product..

"
"

  During this pandemic, I had lost hope that I will get a premium smartphone under 9000 rupees but Amazon made it possible.  No doubt performance of this mobile phone is quite good. Battery life is awesome. Camera quality is not very good but if you look the price of this phone it's ok. Screen appearance and sound quality is also up to the mark. Fingerprint scanner is missing in this phone while fingerprint reader is working well.

"
"

  Worst phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎 not purchase it please..... Redmi is a cheap company fake battery performance and no chroma boostHangs a lot after few days of purchase ......, worst ever

"
"

  Superb phone. this phone I purchased for my 13 year old daughter for her online zoom classes. Two time she dropped the phone from her hand but thankfully nothing happens. This proves that this is quite hardy set too. She is happy with the phone because she don't have to charge it every after each class like before. One day full charge means no need to charge for nxt 2-3 days. Super.

"
"

  Very avg product. Got it for 8300 ..3/32 gb. Camera 2/5Display worst 2/5.Battery life 5/5.Performance 3/5.Audio (speaker)3/5.Overall 3/5.

"
"

  Don't be fooled this mobile isn't what they are showing!!  Battery isn't 5000 mah coz it hardly works only for one day...camera quality is not that good specially of front camera!!

"
"

  Best in this Price. Design is Amazing. I brought Sea Blue colour. Camera is Awesome, Portrait Mode is Outstanding. Battery Life is Really Good, easily last for One and Half Day even if you use your Smartphone Continuously.Now, the MIUI 11 is best SOS Based on Android 9 Pie.You Should Really Go For It.You will not be Disappointed.It is Best in this Budget.Very very very Happy...........🤗🤗🤗🤘🤘

"
"

  Before When I used redmi Note 5, I can't call any body at particular area...But now  BSNL tower is displayed and i can call everybody ...and camera is so good...Battery life i charged yesterday at 2:00PM 96% ... tomorrow till 10:45AM , 89% display , in Between cap i used data 2 Hrs, speak 1 Hr,

"
"

  All the phone specs in Redmi 8a Dual are great! but Redmi 8a Dual phone has a primary camera of 13+2 mp and  secondary phone camera of 8 mp. But the pictures clicked from the  primary camera are only 12 mp and the pictures clicked from secondary camera are only 6 mp.

"
"

  It's too good smart phone at budget price but there is no fingerprint scanner, slow processor but it's quite good at this price point and redmi provides type C port and 18 watt fast charging support, good grip design which doesn't come in other Brand smartphones.

"
"

  Good mobile but its made in china manufacture not made in india, so I am not satisfied. I heat china.

"
"

  I have already used redmi 4a which good for one and half year but after that phone started issues of touch problem and ghost touch problem, i frequently heard from friends who using redmi phones.Now new phone itself a problem though it seems not a great problem but led backlights in screen cleary visible in bottom. It seems okay now. But in future not sure about that. Will see for next few or i will return.

"
"

  Battery is average not good enough as given in specifications.As per specifications battery backup during video play back is 34 hours but I guarantee that you will have to charge it thrice in 34 hours.Charager becomes heat after 30 min of charging. And according to battery charger has low capacity to charge.I don't like this phone.I will have to return this phone.

"
"

  To be honest with you guys rhus phone is superbI am actually a heavy user an thus phone is perfectly perfect at this price. Battery is fabulous camera is just so clear (better then vivo and oppo) and display is also big but it only lacks at fingerprint by the way apple 11 series also doesn't have fingerprint so thisphine is perfect.Believe me guys this a smart choice and smart move too

"
"

  I am giving a Delivery day review!Looks good and I hope it'll work good as well! Used YouTube for a while and it got a little hot, I hope it's not a bad sign or something.And yaa it's a good phone at this range.

"
"

  User guide - Not able to read because of very small letters  and illegibleWarranty details not knownWhether this is having Finger print  identity>Detailed booklet on instructions and about REDMI 8A  dual 3 GB / 64 GB Storage not available  These items may be arranged for my referenceDisplay Brightness level  automatic adjustment  case is not clear

"
"

  I bought it on Apr.. now Jun 2nd... It's getting too heat... Not able to use it more than half hour.. it's getting too heat . Am not happy with the. Product. ....

"
"

  Phone performance good under this price. But the facelock feature is unlocking the mobile at a slower speed. Sometimes recognizing the face but not unlocking just shows facelock verifying, i need to enter the password to unlock. Facelock feature not working properly

"
"

  At 6500 price best phone I get the camera quality is also nic with this price and the over whole features is also nic.Night image is also ok ok because at this price we cannot except to much clearity but the image we can see is nic.

"
"

  Excellent product. Battery performance very good. Cleaner app effective. Feature of auto turn off at night and turn on in morning (savev on battery) effective. Camera is also very good.

"
"

  Battery and performance are good comparing to the price but 1 disadvantage is that this product came with 10w charger adapter this make it slow charging so you would prefer a batter charger adapter like 18w adapter but overall it is a very good product with less price👍

"
"

  1) Just its 2 days, now call center is saying hardware issue is there since it's not operating properly.2) Camera quality is poor3) Auto brightness mode doesn't work properly4) Wifi doesn't get connected, they are asking to check at service center.

"
"

  Very bad phone

"
"

  Pros:Battery life of the phone is good.Quick charge optionPicture clarity is good.Cons:Camera quality is not so greatLil heavierWith in a month , the power charger isn't working.All the videos are played in slow motion as there was no sync between the motion and the audio.. I had to install the VLC for playing the videos.

"
"

  On box the list of contains was there. In which gorilla glass was mentioned.. but on opening of box, we found only poly cover of gorrilla glass but gorrilla glass was missing.. which indicates that the item gorrilla glass was intensively removed from the mobile box before dispatched..  which is directly cheating with customer... not good... the dispatcher should be blacklisted..

"
"

  this is ultimate budget mobile in this range. and the battery life is just awesome. my mom use it . and she needs to charge it once a week. just a quality mobile

"
"

  Battery drains a lot. 5000 mah .is useless. even with average usage, it lasts only a day. Even in stand by battery drains.Its only the price and decent performance that I have given it 3 star else would have chosen only 1 star.

"
"

  Low Quality mobile...Don't buy  1).Sometimes Touch not work  2).Camera Quality is Average  3).Many adds are coming  4).App icon size are large  5).Does not moving files to sd card Overall this mobile is Waste...Battery only best but all performance are poor..touch not work,No sd card move i am very irritating...Choose another mobile at this price range

"
"

  Received the cell 8dual in proper condition. Thanks Amazon, but the warranty card, user guide and sim pin was missing. Please do the needful. Before dispatching please go through the item . Rest is fine

"
"

  This is my first time to order this phone online. It is really amazing. My friend told me not to buy phone online due to defect but i took a risk n i saved 1000/- bcoz market price is around 8500/-But they were wrong there's no defect.I really love it... N battery life is also very good... Thank you Amazon❤

"
"

  I was Micromax Q334 which has 5 Mp. camera which is far far better than RedMI 8A Dual 13 MP camera. Battery backup is good but it takes so much time to charge , approximately 2 hours for full recharge. and rest are good

"
"

  Pro- Slim and easy to handle- best in price- overall experience is goodConc- Mi unwanted apps-dont like MI operating that muchIt should be easy to use

"
"

  Battery back is very poor. It takes 3 hours for fully charge the phone and drain in 10 hours with normal use.Don not go for this mobile if you want good battery back up. The battery claim is false.

"
"

  Friends, never buy this mobile, it's a fault mobile. My mobille facing battery problem and display issue after 8 days of delivery. Both MI and Amazon refuse to replace. MI service is very poor and so guys never choose this mobile. MI service center informed me that 10 days replacement warranty is applicable for Flipkart only. I don't know what to do. Anyway I cheeted by MI and Amazon.

"
"

  Very comfortable product.  Good battery life also. They not provide phone back cover.  The fresh phone how to without use of back cover.  Please add back cover in this type phone.Camera clarity average. Face recognition perfect. Sound clarity, display size also good.  No fingerprint reader in this product then why you add  Star review on fingerprint reader in this page. I can't understand that.

"
"

  Good average phone little costlyCan get infinix with major upgradeCamera not worth itProcessor fineMemory fineIts averageIts too costly

"
"

  One of the worst phones out there, it started to hang in just one month I didn't expect that with a new device. All of a sudden the screen goes blank and keeps blinking battery is decent, camera is ok for this price but the performance is worst and one more upsetting factor that i did noticed after receiving no fingerprint sensor

"
"

  I loved the product battery life is good. Display and camera qaulity is ok.But I am very much disappointed with dilevery boy (Satish) he was very rude, even he was not following the rules for Covid-19. I have done shopping in past from Amazon and flipkart but never experienced this kind of behavior from dilevery boy

"
"

  I buy this mobile . battery  is awesome more than 1 day it's life.Battery charging time - 2.30 hrs with 2amp chargerCamera - averageProcesser - slow  while simple usage its frame dropTime for opening an app back to home screen is 2-3 sec which is very high. Some bug are still after update. Please resolve it

"
"

  Battery life goodPerformance not goodSome times it's not properly respondingCamera not a good oneAlways signal loosing

"
"

  Overall worthy smartphone• Battery life so good• Camera is good for daily need purpose• Display better result• fingerprint not available but faceunlock works.

"
"

  In this price range it is a good choice. Battery life is good. No lag till now. But camera should be better. Low light photography is very poor. Camera always suffer from low light. Selfie camera is decent. Overall a budget phone for day to day work. Don't expect more from this.

"
"

  If you thinking to buy a budget phone redmi 8a dual is great package.negative side-1)You don't get fingerprint scanner2)Even it is redmi phone you didn't get IR Blaster means there is no option of MI remote.3)camera is decent. Portrait mode is not that good.4)This phone supports 18w charger but you get 10w charger in box.5)you didn't get case in box.

"
"

  The display started failing 2 days after the return period ended. Started to automatically open and close apps. Screen would randomly go black, go to the lockscreen and unlock automatically. Since it started failing just after the return period ended makes it seem like this is a planned SCAM. I would recommend not to buy this phone.

"
"

  What a awesome service by Amazon!! Even in this pandemic time, really impressed.Amazon delivered the product on time.Phone is really good, I gifted this phone to my parents and they liked it. Reasonable price with all features.

"
"

  This phone one of good this price range, c type charger, dual camera 8 mp front, 5000mah battery

"
"

   Good battery backup, decent camera & bright display at this price point but there is no finger print censor and the other hand delivery time is also once again 60% faster than Flipkart.

"
"

  This is the best mobile I have ever seen under budget, ❤❤❤this mobile is good for all , easy to use, various themes are their . Good camera clearity. You can play pubg without any glitch. Two sim slot. And the speaker is owsmmmm.. The sound is tooo loud... Which is great for music lovers 😍😍😍😍. You can go for it.... This is like""CHOTA PACK BADA DHAMAKA""

"
"

  this is China product and take a lot of confusion while operating. Apps and software not updated as per new Indian rules. Getting confussion and delay in operating the phone

"
"

  No finger print available.Battery life is better.Camera is average. sound quality is better. Overall it's avg phone with this range of 8k.

"
"

  It has no fingerprint.Battery life is good.Camera quality for this price segment is very good.No lag.Overall it is a good choice for this price segment.

"
"

  No ir ,no fast charger in the box,but great phone with good processes and battery,camera ok ok, look great,in hand feel owsome

"
"

  At this price range this is the best phoneYou can do decenet gamingCamera is awesomeBattery backup nearly 10hrs continuous useCharges in 2 and half hoursPhone is very strong with tempered glass I dropped nearly 10 times from 5feet height no single damageIf your budget is below 10k this phone will reach your expectations

"
"

  Samsung m30 is best performer for a 10k phone. Camera is good and chinese phone cameras are nowhere close to it. Massive 5000mah battery with 15w fast charging. Only issue is battery heats even after a 5-min call. Samsung please bring some update to fix it. SAMSUNG is amazing.

"
"

  The phone comes at an attractive price yet offers good features, particularly the battery. There are many apps from mi that might get a tad annoying, make sure to switch off notifications, an easy work around.Camera and sound quality are decent. Phone performs and responds well.

"
"

  Display remain in that photo shownThat mobile does not any activities.Care persons not contact to that problem after inform to customer careVery worst responseCustomer care every time I call they told transfer to senior and after 5 mins call will be disconnected they rotene 5 times my money total waste.next time I don't buy on that website total cheet

"
"

  Best mobile in class because it has Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and type C port with 18w fast charge , and Qualcomm quick charge 3 support, it's better then redmi 9A, Redmi 9i.

"
"

  Satisfactory phone because of it's price!! A fine offering for ₹8000 phone but the issue of hanging continuously and the high heating problem makes me angry!!!No heavy apps are installed still after only 1 month of use such problems are arising....It's better to go for ₹10000 Or more but not this one!!

"
"

  I AM FIRST TIME USER OF REDMI PHONE.AT THIS COST THIS PHONE IS BEST.P-HONE IS WORKING SMOOTHLY.ALL GAME ARE RUN SMOOTHLY. NFS RUN OKAY.BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD.CAMERA QUALITY IS NOT GOOD. BELOW AVERAGE.FINGERPRINT READER IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS PHONE.

"
"

  Good product,only 2 colour variant only available to improve the colour variant and then,expand RAM space and ROM,Good looking,I feeling like heavy weight,Quick charging all very good working,No fingerprint,Good camera,Gaming performance was ok,Battery life good

"
"

  Mobile hanging intermittently, sometimes touchscreen not responding. Camera quality is not satisfactory. I was using different models of Redmi mobiles since last few years. But it's bye bye time... Amazon not returning this mobile within stipulated time frame 26/08/2020 from purchase date 18/08/2020.

"
"

  If you planing to get best looking phone for nearly 7000 redmi 8a dual is the best option to buy among all others. Display is right on part, battery is awesome, supports fast change 2.0 (18W), cemera is decent for video calls, and fells like durable device on hands.

"
"

   Mobile is so light weighted,and thanx to amozon to delivered timely. Camera picture quality very good and i give 10/10 for performance.

"
"

  Its a really good model at this price range. With good battery life and great camera quality. It also comes with 32gb internal memory and 2 gb ram which is also quite good. Fast charging and gaming speed is good too.And redmi is a very well-known brand.If you don't want much high featured mobile then its for you. Give it a try

"
"

  Pros-First look: Great built quality, looks like a 13k phone not 7.5k.Display quality seems like full HD.Camera quality (front and back) better than Motorola g5s plus(13MP) and portrait mode is great at this price point.Cons:Slightly lagging appears.

"
"

  Very bad. When calling the voice of other person is not clear. I think some kind of defect with my handset. Kindly guide me how to claim warranty?

"
"

  The phone was working well for a few weeks. Then suddenly started shutting down in middle watching a video or WhatsApp. It's been only 3 months since I have purchased this one. This was the first experience of smart phone for my Mom. Can't be a more pathetic experience. I need help to exchange this. I am unable to find a way to reach out. Please help.

"
"

  Noooo fingerprint s there..bt ask fr d ratings of finger print 😂..therz nly face unlock .... Mbl S gud enough with some latest apps.... Overall pick up some gud n reasonable..

"
"

  i bought it for my grandpa. this is good phone. not a gaming focused phone but will get your daily task fairly easily.it heats up during charge but its normal for 18w charger.if you want a daily driver and if you dont game that much then go for it. if you want a budget gaming phone then check realme c series.

"
"

   Hello Sir, We are buying a phone from amazon and it delivered on 10th sept,2020 and return timeline complete on 17th Sept, 2020 and today i found a problem like attached photo and videos. we are used this phone in my hand and  accidently stop working.

"
"

  Excellent phone in budget segment... Camera quality is good.. Battery life 52 hours and 528 hour standby.. No lag.. Good performance.. You can use Google lence without any app.. Good quality.. Dual volte and VOwifi support.. I loved it also thanks to Amazon for fast delivery.. Miui 12 update has arrived in this phone. The phone you should buy in this time..

"
"

  I am writing the review after 20 day use. This phone have no finger print sensor. But battery life is ok. Camera quality also good. Selfi camera not so good but budget wise it's a good phone. Everything is very good in this range.

"
"

  A mid-range phone with every necessary features. The design of the phone is superb. An all day use phone and you don't need to exercise regularly with charging your phone. The audio quality and mic works at par. However, if you are looking for a camera phone it may not reach upto your expectations. It's an ideal handset to gift it to your parents.

"
"

  As expected an Mi product of topnotch quality. Unmatched configuration and features at the price. Best value for money. MAde in India.

"
"

  I bought this product for my grandmother. She doesn't need high end configuration. It has been 15 days or so and she is very happy with it. Battery life is really good and phone is decent looking. Easy to work with. Nice for day to day simple usage. Cannot comment on heavy duty usage as my grandmother doesn't need it.

"

  Don't have finger print sensor. Battery life is good in new condition butI have listened that battery life will be degraded after use of some months.Also one bad thing is the poor quality of pictures taken by rear camera instead of having dual rear camera. Pictures taken by rear camera is too dark in quality.

"
"

  So i bought this phone on 5th march 2020 for my mother. It went smooth because anyway she doesnt use phone apart from call and whatsapp. Now since 2 days the phone is not starting. It hanged first, when i she switched off phone to restart and again tried to start, it failed.its been 2 days the phone is dead. Its hardly 2 months. Highly disappointed. Poor quality of product.

"
"

  This mobile is nice but there is a problem in it when I call someone it couldn't call then I have to reboot it and then it works I have to reboot it at least three times in a day . It's the major problem in it but the camera and battery life are superb. There should also be a fingerprint scanner. I give the mobile three stars from five stars .

"
"

  Great mobile at this price rangeAmazing look.. Love the sea blue colour.. Good Battery Life and Good Camera Quality.. It doesn't have a fingerprint reader but Face Recognition is available

"
"

  I ordered a 2 GB RAM version earlier for one of my family member that worked fine. But this 3 GB RAM version started giving problems after 2 weeks of use. The screen often starts blinking and the phone has to be restarted again and again. The return window was closed. I think this is pathetic phone. Don’t buy it.

"
"

  I didn't find a finger print reader in this phone it was strange for me , the battery life is good , camera quality is ohk ohk , the phone have a face reader for unlocking the phone , I didn't tested it till now I would update the review after testing it , but it's good for normal use ..

"
"

  After using this about 6 month. I got this for 6500.Its really worth it in this range. Except camera every thing is upto mark.Battery backup is awesome.Paisa Wasool.

"
"

  the looks from the front is as same as redmi note 8 u’ll not find any difference, battery life is fantastic, audio quality is also good overall good smart phone and in this price point u won’t get the phone like this.Bit first let i thank and appreciate the Amazon, by sending this phone within no time and in good packaging

"
"

  Dont go buy the review of other if you spend 7.5k on a phone and you expect a performance of a flagship phone than its your problem.. This is a decent smartphone works flawlessly.. Camera is ok ok not that great but overall I didnt feel any lag ot any problem till now its been more than a month... Recommended👍👍

"
"

  Very good phone this price and very good specification and features this price...But fingerprint sensor not......

"
"

  Phone battery is not charging. I kept the phone for charging like crazy,,, but it's not working. Even if I charge for hours, it'll be having just 20%-30% charge. I really need a replacement. Please someone help me. It's been just 20 days I ordered this and return data also crossed. I am so much disappointed with the product and return policy of this device. Someone help me...

"
"

  This phone is one of best entry level  smartphone under 10k with some valuable features like type c port with fast charging, Gorila glass 5 protection and Snapdragon processor better then P22/P25/A25 of mediateak .....

"
"

  Just waste of money. Worse experience with Amqzon ever. Display is shaking automatically after few minutes of using. Worst thing is that it charged 27% only after long 14 hours. I foumd no fingerprint whereas it's asking to review fingerprint.

"
"

  Its good in this price range and my cousins were using this from 2years,yet times it become slow but restart helps to fix things.

"
"

  First of all its chinese phone but manufactured in india and we indians have no option when we are choosing any phone below 10k so I found this redmi 8A phone. Phone quality is superb with 3 gb ram and 32 gb internal storage with Microsoft sd card and AI camera is awesome. no hang just use it and go for it.

"
"

  Good Phone at this Budget. Sound is clear and loud. Camera quality good at day time. 5000 MaH battery is better than other phone, may operate for whole day with good usage.Except for the chinese apps and update, not sure, it would update or not.

"
"

  After approx 15-20 days of use... It's screen start getting freeze and sudden shutdown unable to access anything further...When contacted to customer care... They just keep it for 7 days amd replaca as it is...It is still giving problem while using yet customer care doesn't replace or help with anything.

"
"

  The mobile was really good at this price.There is no fingerprint reader,camera quality is ok and the battery was awesome.It stays for a long.Budget friendly  mobile.It is not fit for gaming and it is a better choice for online class.Hope this review helps you:)

"
"

  (1) I guess camera used to be better in the earlier Redmi phones.(2) The buttons on the side (volume, power) gets accidentally pressed often. Sometimes fast boot opens.(3) Phone doesn't feel very safe to hold. I constantly feel like I'll drop it. Perhaps it's due to size.

"
"

  Within 3 months of purchase the phone crashes and hangs a lot . It’s used for only whatsapp and YouTube mostly. Such simple applications cause phone not responding and requires a restart . I bought this as gift to my mom who handles it so previously yet the phone is a huge let down my first redmi phone. Doubt if I will ever return Redmi. Hope some patch or fix can improve it

"
"

  3gb 32 gb : Without any heavy app. installation and even , phone get hang ,reboot is only option in such cases.Except above issue , battery, camera, sound ,design,display are pretty good in this range

"
"

  The colour of the ph is outstandingBut it's have only the outlook,Inside the phone is not satisfiedLittle bit of lag, 720 pixels regulation,☹️DisgustingOnly the battery is good but the charging time is 2.50-3 hours to get 0 to 100%Really not satisfiedBetter you can buy resmi 8a in less price but same phone

"
"

  Display is destroyed so not available this item when available

"
"

  Fantastic phone quality, great experience..First time i am using redmi and great performance at this Price..Qualcomm processor fantastic job and battery perform first class, camera also good job..And I would to true say the phone quality fantastic.

"
"

  #Desh ka Dumdar Phone by Redmi India.I suggest to you go for this. Amazing Mind-blowing Product. Also, In this phone fingerprint reader is not present. But for budget phone award goes to this under 7500rs. Superb

"
"

  Good Phone, so far working fine, in this price range you can pick this phone, has good quality camera and ram management is also fine.Best part its battery life. In normal usage may be 2 day backup

"
"

  MI phones are worst in quality. It's hanging too much even when I only have 4 simple apps. When in loud speaker mode, even speaker and Mike both seems to be not working properly only after 20 days. Phone is having heating issue & they are having worst service center as they never provide quality service.

"
"

  This is Really Amazing in this price point 😘It has recently received Android 10 update.Battery runs two  days while light usage.Camera is more than average.Long Shots are Awesome.It is enough powerful to run GTA SA, Free Fire on Ultra settings.In my opinion it should be priced around 7,000₹.

"
"

  I bought it for mom..c is newto andriod.. In this price.. Product is good.. Camera n fingerprint reader is good.. Battery depends on use.. Apps..

"
"

  I bought this phone for my dad he isn't a gamer so I tkoght 2GB RAM would be enough and yeah it's enough for daily useBattery stays for a whole day or two with full brightness YouTube streaming I don't know  about that..There wasn't a fingerprint reader that was a bummer but yeah for 7.5k it meets the requirements

"
"

  Very good mid range phone. But the camera quality is not up to the mark. Pubg and codm runs smoothly but gyroscope is not good.heats on charging like any other redmi phone.

"
"

  Awesome smartphone at this price range. Nothing beats it. Nice smooth processor for normal usage. Not for gaming though.

"
"

  Good battery backup and it gives more than 8 hours screeen ontime for one complete charge but in case you are interested in Wireless FM Radio then this is more than dispointment. Xaiomi should be sued for such wrong publicity about  wireless FM radio.

"
"

  this mobile is super everything is great battery backup camera display all is avesam and its design is very impressive I like this mobile very much in this budget is mobile is superb you should for go for it

"
"

  Picture quality is very much bad for the bad camera quality.I sugest try other option which is better then this phone.Most problematic MI stores also, every time required update.

"
"

  Nice mobile according to price, camera more than average, everything is good I am happy with this product. Only one problem at the time of incoming call, when we cover proximity sensor, screen turns off and only rings, we have to on screen from the side button, it's solution is you can on the raise to wake option. Thnx to Amazon

"
"

  I 1st time purchased mi phone & as I thought it’s exactly like that WORST PRODUCT, software issues as you can see in upload video, apps automatically start running, very irritating experienceRequest DONT WASTE MONEY TO BUY THIS PRODUCT

"
"

  Not good for long use, battery camera not up to the mark

"
"

  Its a good Budget mobile .Battery back up is good , it really is 5000mAh battery.Camera is Good but  dont expect High quality Pics .

"
"

  Goodphone

"
"

  First impression ,Good .I bought this for my mom(Amma). Detailed review soon

"
"

  Schedule power on and off and find device options are not working though I followed direction provided by mi customer care and factory data reset. There is a problem in software. Company should notice the problem and customer should notice. Thanks for the replacement initiation.

"
"

  It is lightweight and I like the look. Battery backup is nice. Camera is average. Not like dslr. 😁Processor is fast.

"
"

  Phn isntoo gud but amazon cheat me they cant give me charger.  Nd when I complained they said to self return this product

"
"

  Overall This Mobile is good.1. Bad Camera quality. Selfie camera is good.2. Good battery life3. Slow Mobile4. Back side cover quality is not good5. Better to have good quality pouchIt is suitable For normal usage people

"
"

  Very good battery back up. I watched You tube for 1.5 hours and only 10% battery consumed.Good mobile in such a cheap price.

"
"

  I will never suggest anyone to buy this phone. Now a days quality of mi phones are getting degraded. Phone is hanging a lot. Also some inbuilt feature like screen shot is not working. Not a good phone. Only plus point is battery life, which is good. But apart from that other aspects of a good phone are very poor.

"
"

  It's one of best mobile in low budget, but not good quality of camera. Good for online access, surfing. Not good for video game player.

"
"

  Excellent product ..!1) good touch quality2) HD screen3) Good camera quality4) nice design.Finally great product & affordable price.!

"
"

  I received a used device. The pin wasn't there, cardboard was broken.After switching it on, it didn't ask for my Google account. Home page ooened straight away. I cleared the data and it locked me out saying someone's MI account is already linked to it and now I'm unable to even turn on my phone

"
"

  Performance has been docile after 3 weeks of use.Battery is indeed exceptional along with several other features that make this phone distinctive in the marketplace.However camera quality could have been massively upgraded.Finger print sensor should have been present.Otherwise Okayish in the price range.

"
"

  India's most third class brand is Mi. Not satisfied with this product at all. From the very first day I faced issue. Recent app key does not work properly. Recent app areautomatically dilited. Poor camera quality. Setting is very complicating. Full of 3rd class features. The only satisfactory thing is its battery.

"
"

  Super phone with great look and battery back up. Phone pic and video quality is great.

"
"

  It's a very good product for budget price in lockdown,,battery very good, this is Speacilaty of this product,, over all this phone is very good,, I am very happy to get this product due to study purpose. Thanks to Amazon to gave cod on this product,.

"
"

  Product is good but it's not made in India .It's made in ChinaClearly written on boxIt's imported from China .

"
"

  Just after 42 days, the phone started misbehaving, from any section of mobile it is coming back to home screen automatically in less than a minute, MIUI experience is not good, faulted phone is sent by seller and Mi company, Amazon please look into this, please compensate, I am hurt

"
"

  Battery capacity given 5000maH but actually not like that, battery capacity actually proven for 3000mah. The draining speed is as same as 3000 or less mah. Overall the performance is good but in a term of battery capacity little compromised whether it's internal falut or battery problem that cannot be understand.

"
"

  I purchased 3Gb RAM Variant at rs 8500 and I think it is overpriced as it's camera, processor, screen quality is very bad.

"
"

  The screen of the Redmi 8a is pretty good under Rs 8,000 price phone.I've purchased it for my Mom🥰...She is very happy with this SURPRISE.t has a light weight,thin that you are very easily use for the daily life. 🙂But not really satisfied with the camera quality😢

"
"

  Sir product is hanging a lot from past 20 days . I reboot & updated it 5-6 times still problem continues.  Also there is no replace or warranty option given by you. Extremely disappointed from amazon service . Please solve my problem .There is something very wrong with the software of this product.

"
"

  Till date no issues, good working. I don't think there may be any problems. Good one in this range. No fingerprint reader. Camera is average.

"
"

  the phone is so much laaging .we cant play pubg ,ff  smoothly .the best thing i like  in this phone its battery performence and the back design .

"
"

  i dont why sellers took 8 days for shipping. what he was doing (preparing for refurbished?) i didnt get free basic transparent pouch in side the box. he is too late to ship the product. Apario pvt ltd

"
"

  This phone is good only very for normal user 2gb ram hang this phone sometime.but note its battery is awesome call quality is good speaker is average, design is also good not slippery camera is average, and what u get in jst 7499

"
"

  Best Phone in the price segment. Built quality, camera performance and battery backup is awesome. It's Redmi so we get everything best in affordable price.

"
"

  The phone is good but the camera quality is very poor. It has a written 13 megapixel camera, but it takes pictures like a 5 megapixel camera. No good photo can be taken at night. Overall a good phone, but not recommended for those buying for the camera..

"
"

  I have doubts regarding manufacturing and import date of product. As Date of manufacturing is June 20 and date of import is July 20 . How it's possible that phone is imported in India in July 20 which yet to be come

"
"

  I bought this phone on 3rd march. Returned on 7th march due to mal function. They sent me one more cell but im facing the sane problen. It always tell 'find device closed unexpectedly'. Due to this problem im unable to open some apps like whatsapp and youtube. Even im unable to open camera app some times.

"
"

  Best phone

"
"

  During incoming call display is not showing , we have to unlock the phone to see who is calling.we also wnet to MI center , they reported sensor is not working properly.Please don't buy this phone . Increase the buget if possible to buy other phone. my friend also bought this phone and also received defective one.

"
"

  It doesn't contains Fingerprint reader, Battery life is OK. Again We are so dissatisfied with the camera Quality. Overall this phone is not so satisfying but till it's ok to have this phone !!!

"
"

  Got the budget phone @7499 For 2 gb-32 gb , truly needed for Online Classes, I also suggest to sale at previous discounted price with more choices. Phone is nice, with clear display, Sound is good, Network connectivity is good. Basic needs fulfilled.

"
"

  I purchased it for my mother ... a really very nice product...cam quality with AI  is also good .....Battery life awesome... sound quality good...MIUI 11 supporting system....fast charging with 18 W plug....Go for it..best budget phone

"
"

  Dear everyone,Please don't purchase this phone. after 15 days of purchased, the display not working properly. Automatically many app opening and closing without touching phone. Some software issues is there. But they telling good option within the budget range. Totally waste of money...

"
"

  A budget smartphone , not expect much.Display is quite satisfactoryBattery lasts for one and a half day if you use constantly.No finger print sensorNo gravity sensorCamera is above averageLacks night escape modeCharger heats up a lot during charging

"
"

  Battery got discharged in one night. It was just kept aside without sim and wifi. Will check other features after the phone is charged.

"
"

  The mobile is only 7 days old & the processor is malfunctioning.The product could not be returned within 7 days as the return request could not be processed due to tedious policy of self check could not be materialized.Very very disappointed.

"
"

  Product and service of Amazon is good. I have purchased this mobile in Rs. 8299/- marginally Price is high.Drawbacks- Pre installed app like mi account, mi browser, mi store, mi video , mi pay, mi credit, shareMe and mi community. Which leads to unnecessary memory's cosumption.

"
"

  Nice phone at this priceProsBattery lifeGood displayGorilla glass 5 protectionSD 439 energy efficiency 12nmMIUI interfaceConsAverage cameraNo finger print censorOutdoor visibility in direct sunlightNo IR Blaster

"
"

  Bought this for my mom.  This mobile set is dazzling and has great appeal.  Such a good set at such less price!!

"
"

  It serves all my needs. Display, camera are satisfactory. Signal capturing capability is really good. Touch response time is normal. Battery life is also sufficiently good.

"
"

  The whole mobile set and its functions are very good as compared to it's price. The phone doesn't have fingerprint sensor but camera and battery life are very good. Satisfied with my purchase.

"
"

  Good product and worth ...ideal phone for only calling and whtsp ..since it has less ram and storage ... suitable for eldersAverage cameraBattery doesn't drain muchA bit slow ..not really slow!The back cover has a rough texture , better grip

"
"

  Product was working fine, with this budget got a 3GB RAM,32GB storage mobile and Camera pixels also more as compare to competitors products,It’s simply worthy. And Good product.

"
"

  This product is exalent. Mi 8a dual phone is very intalegent mobile, superb quality. Mi is company quality first rank really great technology, with dolby, dts sound in ear phones. Thank you amazon, ilke phone, one million ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,,,,,.....

"
"

  This is the best mobile I've ever bought. One thing that i like about it is... It never hangs and processor is damn fast mtlb amazing😍.  But the one thing only i dislike about this device is the design.... When it comes to its design its a Lil bit odd. But overall this phone is amazing.

"
"

  Dislikes: not two day battery, screen resolution Dotty, MI apps useless and can't be uninstalled.Likes: best option below 10k, better than Samsung, satisfactory ownership.

"
"

  Not expected this quality from MI, only after 7 weeks of using its sound speaker is not functioning, mobile also hangs frequently, also getting hot during long calls, worst quality got.As a true customer, If possible, request MI to change the mobile with new one.

"
"

  Budget mobile.....Worthy for money....Little bit disappointed by the processor ....Could have been upgraded but speed is very good for normal user rather than gamers......Especially battery is tooooo goooood .......Type C charger is an advantage..With 18w charger

"
"

  Ear Speaker noise is very less as compaired to Redmi 6A always need to use on speaker. Unable to heard properly so creating miss understanding. Good product in this Price. Battery life good but need to also improve. Selfies camera is awesome.. As compaired to other same specifications this is very good👍👍

"
"

  Good quality. Finger print sensor not yet used. Battery and camera are good. Pre-installed apps are a problem

"
"

  I would rate this product ZERO.. pls do not buy this product waste of money..After inserting the sim the phone is always switched off.  Due to this had got the SIM also changed but the issue of the phone continues.. same sim works on other phone perfectly fine.

"
"

  Budget phone under 10000 and specs are quite impressive but when it comes to camera it's almost similar to redmi 7a...and battery life is okay-okay...fast charging support with type-c charger...face unlock okay-okay...performance amazing...attractive look(sky white)..₹8299 is worth it..

"
"

  It's a amazing phone📱. It's battery has a great power which is long lasts. And fast charging is also super duper. There's no fingerprint reader but other securities performs there best. It's camera quality is good and best selfie it's auto focusing is fantastic. Loving it

"
"

  Battery - 10 marksCamera - 7½ marks.(In this budget price it's worth but the image can be more brighter)Performance - 8 marks. Has good dual 4G speed and shows no lags while playing games.Overall - 8 marks

"
"

  Don't know, but I ordered this phone and returned it.Received new piece again.But same issue with this phone as well , microphone issue,Not able to hear voice of person who is on the other side.Now going to return this phone and will purchase other phone but not Redmi 8a

"
"

   After 9 day phone display is flickering. When I called to customer care, they simply told me we can't help you, your return window is closed. No support received from Amazon.

"
"

  A good phone in this price range. Back camera got good quality. Front camera is little bit low quality.

"
"

  Backcolur is White & its awesome, camera is as always average for redmi products but processor is good compared to same range realme mobile.

"
"

   Very bad quality. Speaker and mic  Very bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and micVery bad quality. Speaker and mic

  Nice product by Redmi. A budget smartphone for everyone. Nice battery backup. Nice design. And Amazon service is also very good, delivery agent is very polite. Overall a good experience with Amazon Service. I hope Amazon will provide this flexible service everytime and to everyone.

"
"

  Looking great product 👌.I am looking back cover but hasn't in.selfi camera looking great.packing is good... delivery is well...it has 20 gb storage with phones applications... Snapdragon 439 good processors in the mid range....8300rs...thank you amazon....

"
"

  Hanging, screen not working properly. Didn't work any swhich at time of hanging.very bad feedback from my side.

"
"

  Good phone. Bit bulky may be because of big battery. Awesome back camera, average front camera. No lagging. Overall good budget phone. Ideal for elderly people.

"
"

  Pretty bad performance. Battery drains out in few hours (max 4 hrs) camera quality is not great could have gone for other brands with the same range.

"
"

  Basically A phone for Basic Usage.. If u are a Gaming person don't go for this one but if u hv to give it to ur parents or u urself has limited usage u can give this phone a shot.Totally worth it.Value for money phone.

"
"

  After using for 1 week, I am writing this review the fon is awesome, the battery is good and the camera is also good, mostly it is good fon for the parents.

"
"

   5 दिन में Redmi 8A dual का touch खराब हो गया । शिकायत पर कोई रेस्पॉन्स नहीं।मेरे खराब अनुभव के आधार पर redmi का कोई फ़ोन नही खरीदे। 0 स्टार

"
"

  Older text messages goes up. This phone has a limited memory for text messages. It approx saves 100 messages per number. Beyond a certain limit, older messsages diasppear. If I knew this, I never buy this phone.

"
"

  The phone was fine but the charger was not workingIt is a faulty charger. i thought the phone was fine but with a new charger too, charging is not happening. I realised too late that the piece is a bad one.The changing port of the phone is itself faultyIt is a diffective peice

"
"

  Though Phone battery is great , the internal storage is wasted by installing too many un necessary apps. the worst part is that the in built antenna stooped working within few days of purchase and now has to use head phones for FM receiption.

"
"

  Good one. Had ordered for my dad and he seems at ease using the same. Appearance, colour, display, battery are all fine so far

"
"

  2gb ram gets phone slow.

"
"

  Low in price, big screen, good for normal use. People who have low budget, this is very nice. Also got it on emi, it also went smooth.

"
"

  No fingerprint sensor, normal charging speed, camera not bad, pubg play with gfx tool in extreme setting smoothly but gyro repond veey slow (not work properly).This phone made only normal usage.

"
"

  Excellent phone at competitive price. Great value for money. People looking for low budget phone with comparable features of high end, can blindly opt for this phone and make it ranking no. 1 in mobiles

"
"

  I regret buying this after I got to know that I could have bought note 6 pro at slightly higher price, which is better phone then this one :(

"
"

  I gave this phone as a gift to my Sister and she loved the phone. The charger received along with the phone was faulty and did not charge, I called up Amazon however the entire product had to be returned and was also out of stock, there was no option to retutn the charger and hence I did not return it.

"
"

   Defective piece delivered and now not replacing it.because problem had seen in mobile after 10  days of deliverybso now they are not replacing it... Very bad service.. Not satisfied at all

"
"

  Damdar product at this price range. Battery is very good last long front camera is awesome, back panel and its colour looks very cool. Overall very best phone at this price range just go for it

"
"

  Liked display and notch area. Gives feeling of large screen. Happy about battery too. Cam is descent but could have been better for this price range.

"
"

  Battery life 3 days.smooth display. Classic look. fast charge. Good camera.average performence. 7500 price. Low padjet High range mopile

"
"

  Redmi 8a average budget friendly phone...i bought 2 redmi 8a dual.i felt some issues on automatic brightness .Normally it will be work under the light conditions but when i put it on,suddenly the brightness getting low then it will never back to normal light..both devices have same pblm..

"
"

  Good phone in this price range . Can’t expect much from the phone as it is sufficiently loaded.

"
"

  in this price range this is best smartphone for basic use.Its runs PUBG also on low settings but basically its not made for gaming purposes.This is best non gamer user like me who used only phones for calling and normal streaming purposes.And speaker of this phone is quite loud also.I likes this phone.

"
"

  A very good mobile, camera is not good,But performance is good,Recommended for day to day work

"
"

  I bought this phone for my momThe smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. Large screen good camera.

"
"

  Overall a good phone with quite interesting specifications but not for youth they need more powerful processor and other specifications

"
"

  Good mobile at this price I mean it's such a budget friendly phone. And it's battery backup is great.

"
"

  Finger print sensor not available

"
"

  Thank you amazon.time to time delivery super.packaging is excellent.redmi note 8Adual.3gb,64gb mobile is super.

"
"

  Amazing product at this range i don't have to say battery backup is amazing and cameras just do what they are suppose to do, don't expect much from them, overall quality is amazing i love it.

"
"

  Faulty Product - The charger is faulty and the phone does not charge at all. Unfortunately I got the product during the start of lockdown and now I’m stuck with a faulty product without option of being able to return! Extremely unhappy and feel cheated !

"
"

  Good phone in budget price. Need to improve camera quality. Especially front camera needs improvement. Can give silicone cover atleast and charging can be improved fast front

"
"

  I just bought 2 days back..phone is ok  . But they have sent corrupt charger which is not working at all.. please replace it ...it never get charges more than 2 %... or refund my money  .Amazon  should take care of the products before delivering it . We can't wander to courier office often n often.

"
"

  The product was of very bad quality. Tried to connect Amazon on call, but due to lockdown, it was not possible. When I was connected, I told them that volume button is not working, they said try after restarting the phone. That problem still persist and every time I have to restart the phone to operate volume button.

"
"

  This phone gives you a lot of features which doesn't come in other brands in the same price range. Battery is good, camera is okay and fingerprints works just fine. If you have low budget you can go for this phone.

"
"

  Redmi 8A Dual I bought this mobile some months ago & after using this I can bet this is the best mobile phone in such a cheap price...Battery life is good Camera quality is ok ok but only Fingerprint is not in this phone otherwise good for working people.

"
"

  Camera: The camera quality is not good when considered for portrait shoot. Images are not sharp, you will find the camera to be tiny and not a great build.Body build quality: Worth the moneyRAM: Okay, as its not a gaming mobileAI face unlock: Good

"
"

  This is made in China. Imported in 07/2020. Beware.

"
"

  Top class 👌spec's in it's price.well design 🤟by Xiaomi . Value for money.Most of the people who have buy a new phone in this price range they have one thing in the mind that's value for money. And it is that. 🙏Excellent 👍 service by Amazon .

"
"

  Basically  this phone is bought for my mom and she loves it .She is happy what is product  offer to her .But there is only issue with finger print sensor which is not given .

"
"

  Ok ok ,not soo  better go for samsung ...Nothing about this product 3.8 ratingopen light camera  is good 5 ratingBut inside house camera 2.5U decide

"
"

  The Screen starts flickering after use of a Month! Without any rough use of the Phone! Will suggest don’t do for this Phone Rather u can get better of it with MI itself! Such a fault in Screen not tolerable.

"
"

  Worst product. It's feel like brick in hand.. so heavy . Phone hangs a lot and heating issues are there. OS is not fast and remember it produces lot of radiation ... don't go for it.

  The product seemed to be excellent for one month but then began to restart frequently, redmi customer care executive suggested to visit service centre, unable to visit service centre during lockdown. Pathetic experience for the first time from Amazon.

"
"

  There is no warranty card inside the boxNo ear phones connector tooAnd these days a screen guard and a transparent case are given to customers but in amazon theres nothing

"
"

  It get hang up within 2 week. After rebooting by calling customer care it's running ok but risk remains

"
"

  Review after 3 month useNice phone in this rangeGood cameraGood batteryFeel very good and nice look

"
"

  Dislike  :  Not head phone available with this packing.Like  : we like RedmiUse  : for my daughter.

"
"

  Looks very cheap. you can buy an advanced/better mobile by adding two-three thousand to your budget.

"
"

  it's a good product. face sensor is work very good.  it's camera battery life and over all performance is the fantastic with its price. i am so happy with mobile . back cover is not given with  mobile.

"
"

  In my set I am suffering from lost of network, I don't know why this occurs. SIM is tested on other mobile instrument no problem of network. In this set spoken to various times on customer care all test done as per there instructions but all in vein. Kindly help.

"
"

   This phone is worst......the screen start flickering after three to four days of use.

"
"

  Phone worked fine for 10 days but now m facing problems. Apps getting crashed, Opened my  contacts, Screen was automatically running.  when i called someone, screen goes turned off and did not turned on even after pressing power button multiple times.

"
"

  This phone is great from every aspect.I bought this phone for my mom.She was amazed to see the battery backup this phone has.Camera is good too for the price.If you're buying this phone for your mom or dad, then it's a great buy.

"
"

  The product is delivered in good condition.I am satisfied with the packagingI bought this smartphone for old person who only needs it for primary use such as camera whatsApp and calling purpose. Whosoever is buying this for basic purpose can definitely go with this product.

"

I have to unlock my phone again for watching videos and calling. mobile phone has been format by me once but problem remain same. Kindly exchange my phone or refund my money.

"
"

  Product is good genium product but packaging is poor. But my best relation with seller I'm already purchased camera with this seller i love seller  genium product delivered.Thank you Amazon!

"
"

  to be honest best phone in this price range packed with a lot of features having long lasting 5000mah battery life and a real view giving camera systemoverall giving you an unbeliveable performacego for it.

"
"

  Awesome best value in this price range..Best part is its battery.. amazing battery life and negetive point is you will not get ir blaster in this phone no notification led..Also no phone cover..

"
"

  Network Issue, my area is not covered with good cell network, so in this scenarioRedmi 8A Dual is worst, it unable connect with 4G networkWhereas other band's (even Oppo) very low Price range handset also manage to connect Or work with 4G

"
"

  What a pathetic service by Xiaomi redmi.  India already banned Chinese app but they didn't remove app from phone till now I had to remove all banned app like helo app & also I can't uninstall clean master from my new phone. Seriously Amazon what are you doing 😠😠😠😠😠😠

"
"

  Its an Affordable Mobile Phone with all good stuff to operate for whole day the battery.Cons is No Video Calling, Gets somewhat slow after one month after installing all necessary application.

"
"

  Pros-best battery backup... Fast charging🔋... Good brightness... Big battery.. Can be used for 2 days for normal use.... It ruf and tuff use then it can get extended up to.. 5-6 hours.... Overall good budget phone.. #worthit.

"
"

  I bought it for mom as surprise gift.Speaker sound is not that good.Good battery life and camera is good as for its price.

"
"

  Defective product, all apps crash after some time. Cannot make phone calls, cannot see youtube videos. never had such worst experience in 15 days of purchase of a mobile.  Cannot be replaced. Did not expect such deal

"
"

  Screen touch sensor is vey bad quality

"
"

  Awesome phone for the price. I felt this to be more fluid than 7a. Nice in hand feel. But cameras are disappointing

"
"

  Actually i bought this phone my daddy. And he was totally love this phone. Value of money.

"
"

  Camera quality is very awesome battery life is also nice and delivered before the given time awesome experience 😃 I like this phone because of its colour camera battery and life which was really awesome ................must buy because it's really very nice

"
"

  Phone glass quality is very poor.Company says that this is a corning gorilla glass 5.My phone glass has broken when phone fall down from one foot.Very bad experience with this product.

"
"

  When we receive the product charger was not functional as I had some urgency I purchased another charger and using it after 20 days charging come down from 80 % to switched off status within 10 mint. And phone not taking charge it's really shocked wrost produxt for me. Total waist.

"
"

  I bought this phone on 20th August 2020 and after 8 days it's screen is not working properly Amazon gives seven days replacement guarantee which is already over I don't know what to do and if Amazon can not do anything in that then this phone and Amazon deserves 0 star

"
"

  Amazon selles a refubrired phone here. I doubted from the beginning but to be very sure now. If it is within return period I must return but i confimrd the same thing after one month usage. Please dont buy

"
"

  Speaker is not good , camera quality not upto the limit

"
"

  Product is good .only the product which provide type c charging cable and fast charge support. Processor is average .display and camera is good according to the price. Recommended for normal users not for gamer and camera lover

"
"

  This product is having poor quality. And if you buy this mobile you not eligible for refund. This phone Only having replacement option. Quality is really poor. Camera is worst and battery is over heating.Don't buy mobiles from Amazon, buy mobiles from flipkart.

"
"

  Budget cell phone for primary users or new users. Every technical specification is matched to other high end phones. Battery backup, screen size, fast charging every feature is good.

"
"

  Very slow, hanging started form 1st day. Worst purchase better buy a samsung or asus smartphone.

"
"

  Fingerprint Doesn't Here.

"
"

  MESSAGES AND OTP ARE COMING VERY LATE IN THIS DEVICE AND This phone is full of more than 10 GB of unwanted  Chinese apps.From other images of buyer i can see made in india logo on box but my device is not made in india.@Amazon specify it ASAP.

"
"

  Charging speed very slow, takes 3 hour 15mins to charge from 5% to 100%. Too many unwanted apps installed by default and you can't uninstall them. With default factory settings, I'm getting atleast 30-40 notifications per day, which is quite irritating

"
"

  nice android mobile with those features in this price its so cool go for it friends .gaming performance is medium to high ,camera is good ,sound quality supperb,screen feels like a butter slipery,

"
"

   Display screen keeps fluttering  occasionally and mild blinking  in screen. While fluttering  the screen it's  difficult even to switch off.And automatic loading of pages and apps without any indication and pressing.

"
"

  The Battery life on this one is insanely great. Best Battery phone ever under 10K. If you don't play games and just do normal day to day task. Go for 2GB varient. But if you play games then, pick the 3GB varient. Buy this phone you'll never ever regret.

"
"

  It's nice great mobile but,It's hang sometimes and glitche. I said that you want to buy it,you can because it's hang and glitche rarely so you can bye it. 😁😆😅😃

"
"

  Unexpectedly it is an amazing phone (although made in china).It's speaker is mind blowing.Front and rear , both the camera are awesome.Not a gaming phone , as RAM is only 2 GBIt would have been more better if their was a fingerprint sensor in it.

"
"

  The phone is good.The colour is very nice. I ordered a blue color. It is very nice.The problem was with exchange.The exchange person was rude and asked for phone charger and box.He said why will you not give charger.Give charger and earphone also.

"
"

  The product is overall good but you will get the issue while inserting sim by using sim tool ejector you have to try so many times and also.. Battery life is good but it discharges very rapidly overall the product is good and camera quality is also good..

"
"

  The phone is pathetic. I have to wait 30-40 sec to open any app. Camera is shutting down automatically. ALways phone gets hanged

"
"

  I bought in 7500 , worth buying smart phone in this price plus it gives you a real smart phone experience as you will get in any 15k plus phones . Thumbs up . Purchased 2 ( grey n blue ) .

"
"

  This phone has everything you need in a low budget phone. Awesome product. If you are looking for light to moderate use for a low budget phone then is product will sure make you happy. You can't play high end games though.

"
"

  I bought this phone for my Mother....... Phone is awesome for my Mother😍. Value for money.

"
"

  When the delivery boy came, he is not having the card swapping machine only.From the rules and regulations of the government every person has to do online payment but the delivery boy is not having the card swapping machine only although the product is very good.

"
"

  Ill give a fair reviewIt doesn't have finger pring senser and remoteCamera is average and no slowmo , lapse etcIf u are buying for gaming its worstAnd the main thing it doesn't have notification lightsOver all i recommend dont buy it

"
"

  Bought for my daughter for online classes. Considering its quality hardware and built quality and its price Rs. 7500, no other smartphone can complete it.

"
"

  Budget phone... Go for it

"
"

  Display isn't good when u 're in sunlight the display color changes and blink and sometimes touch isn't also working ....

"
"

  Good phone at affordable price . As always , Amazon delivered on time .Wonderful service

"
"

  The best phone with the best quality but i think the battery will start draining fast after sometime and my charger burnt out after two daysI would like the community to change my phone and the ir blasters also not working

"
"

  There is no problem with the mobile but this phone in sold in price by seller is too high otherwise I don't have any complaints about the service and product (mobile).

"
"

  1.) No fingerprint available in this phone but before purchase I have found available in seller post. 2.) And display start blinking problems within 15 days after received. 3.) On purchase time Items show this phone make in India but after received written made in china.

"
"

  Battery life is goodFreeze in some applicationsOverall ratings 4 🌟 out of 5

"
"

  All my friends are complaining that my number is not connecting after I start using this phone. What is the use of buying a mobile when it is not useful for phone calls?? Now I am again using my old mobile for phone calls...waste of money

"
"

  Very nice product. Iam very happy to see this product. quality of product is very good and packaging is very good. I am use this product after 4-5 days and results is very good. I suggest to all person to buy this product. Completely value for money

"
"

  Camera quality is good. Battery is far far better than other products like Moto-G Plus. Havn't tried fingerprint reader as i skipped at the time of setting up the mobile.Need atleast a couple of months for a detailed review on this phone

"
"

  Best phone in under 7500rs price segment.Build quality is good according to price and camera quality superb, battery life is too good 5000mah and also camera is very impressive. All over a good package.Processor is SD439 is best in this price segment.

"
"

  Its a fabulous mobile in this range . Great battery power and face sensor is very good ......over all loved this phone

"
"

  Great phone for the  amount being paid

"
"

  Product is good but fully disappointed with Amazon delivery. Delivery person refused to accept my call and product was showing delivered while I didn't get any product. I had to collect from hub. Please take care of your casual delivery facilities and delivery persons.

"
"

  Good ProductBattery backup is overall good but charging takes little more than usual timeAll other  features are goodCamera is goodPhone is little heavy but overall features of this phone is good.

"
"

  Very bulky handset and bad display. Doesnt feel like a phone more like phablet.

"
"

"
"

  Very very worst & defective product. No.1 fraud Chinese product.. Within month phone stop working... Recommended not buy....

"
"

  Worst experience from Amazon.Phone stopped working after 2 days of use.  I requested return of the product and the return guy came and tell it cannot return as IMEI no cannot be checked. Now the return period is over. I feel cheated.

"
"

  This sea blue smartphone looking is too good and fast working .Battery life is too good as compare by 4000 MAH battery. Front camera is awesome but rear camera little desopoint .Redmi note 3 rear camera is good as compare to Redmi 8a dual

"
"

  Overall good,  only have one problem charging is heating. After 2 hours COUNTINIOUSLY charging the charger is heating 🔥 otherwise camera, battery backup, look everything is awesome.

"
"

  Phone is average, I had gifted it to the music teacher for online classes. He recorded a few minutes audio and sent to students. The audio was very low sound and could barely be audible. otherwise an average phone.

"
"

  Everything is fine except , 1 issue.. Automatic Brightness feature is not working even after latest Miui update also

"
"

  It's a very good smart phone and budget friendly too. Camera quality is fine . I am using it since a week and there are no hang issues experienced. Good phone for self use and if you want to gift it to your parents  you can definitely go ahead👍

"
"

  XIAOMI MI IT'S BIG BRAND IN WORLD..N THAT PHONE ARE VERY GOODAWESOME MOBILE PHONE... THX MIN BIG THANKS TO AMZON. INCAREFULLY DELIVERY.. TO PHONE...

"
"

  There is no fingerprint sensor... But it's ok.. it has good build quality and awesome design... Still worth for 7500... But it is not made in india it is imported from China... Camera quality was ok...

"
"

  Best product under this price range, i order 2 of this for daily work use. As compare to flagship phones it has almost 60 % quality as if you compare on price...Best part of this phone is battery performance. You should definitely go for this value for money phone.

"
"

  at this price segment we could not expect more good features good battery camera is not good display very dull

"
"

  Dear Amazon team I have opened this phone today which was deliver 31 aug but phone battery in not being charged it has been 4 hours nd battery ℅ is still on 33 when I fix it on charged it was 33 battery is showing charged but phone is not charging please replace it soon

"
"

  I have not in mind to buy chinese phone, but samsung models are not good and costly too. So i buyied this. It has network connectivity issues. Lack of proper video call and network hotspot connectivity. Hotspot range is too low about 2-3 miters. Camera is also average.

"
"

  I have received reused phone as when going to charge for 1st time it's already 63% charged ! And there is many apps available one the device! usually those many apps should not be present in new device.. I have ordered new phone and received reused phone! Disappointed😞

"
"

  It's camera is badIn little dark it is unable to take photo13 mp camera but quality is less than 5 mpMicrophone also not working properlyWhile talking in phone callPlease return this order weast of money don't purchase this

"
"

  For common use it's best in the segment,regarding price range under 10000.no fingerprint senser ,only face detection for unlock is not working dim light properly,very good sounds,camara quality is also not very good but it's ok ,after all very good phone,

"
"

  Value for money.. Display and resolution just ok..Overall good buy given the budget

"
"

   Writing review after 1month, the phone was good first 15days, from there we have been facing lot of issues. Apps are opening and closing automatically, one if the worst products from amazon.please respond and what will do

"
"

  Product is value for money but the delivery boy was not so nice as the delivery was a day earlier that too without any prior info. Second the delivery boy not carrying POS machine, Third the delivery boy did not returned 500 Rs which were extra with him.

"
"

  Battery life 5/5looks 3/5performance 3/5built quality 4/5after sale service 4/5 overall Go for it!  good product in this range

"
"

  Superb quality phone as expected

"
"

  Waste of money. Do not buy. I've purchased this phone instead of Redmi 9a even having 700 costly as it's having 13+2 camera but quality is not even good.Amazon is also not ready to return the product. Very disappointed with Amazon

"
"

  The mobile was having sound connection and disconnection problem and device was rooted so the financial apps was not installing and threat to security.so returned

"
"

  The camera is highly impressive with a AI sensor. The battery is also good with 5000amh. This is one of the best phone at such affordable prices.

"
"

  Awesome look, good build quality, decent display at this price range, camera quality above average, dedicated SD card slotNo back cover, average processor, video recordings is not too good

"
"

   For low budget, good storage and high battery life this is the best phone.No fingerprint sensorCharger - includedEarphones - not included

"
"

  I am a great lover of redmi brand but redmi 8a dual disappointed me alot and also Amazon service because as I'm requesting towards my return the product thay are not responding well, Amazon please make sure that return policy to be well appreciate by customer experience thank you.

"
"

  Charger which i got in box is getting overheated while charging. Rest of the product is good.

"
"

  Product is ok, but the service of Amazon is worst. Customer care executive doesn't know anything. Stupid service by Amazon. That denies the offer.Don't go with Amazon cashback offer, they won't give cashback.  This happens twice to me.

"
"

  I dont know but the during making call there is disturbing voice received...no bill was there ...total regret

"
"

  Doesn't have any back cover.. in this amount realme 3i give an back cover and also have a finger print scanner but I don't found this in redmi 8 a dual..Performance is good but too good.. camera is poor quality 😠Overall in this price I don't happy 😑😤

"
"

  After inserting sim card network issue started.Internet is not performing well.Once touch screen automatically operating itself.. after restaring now doing good..but it can happen again.

"
"

  This mobile have 2gb ram. Last 1day i received from Amazon. I test the speed & satisfy very good performance.

"
"

  Good in budget segment.Internal storage should have been increased but worth the price

"
"

  Sometimes unable to disconnect the call. Only disconnect when other side call disconnected.Touch issue in the phone

"
"

  Product I received is getting switched too often. Looks like not a genuine one. Feeling cheated by the seller.

"
"

  I am use only 10 days the phone totally gang and so many processing problem auto video play and display is black very dad very worth don't have buy it

"
"

  This Smartphone Is Very Good As It Branded Company And It's Display Is Also goodCamera In Bright Light Is Fabulous But In Dim Light little bit badBattery life is wonderful normal uses it stays 24 hoursI am satisfy with this range

"
"

  It's ok but features are not so good as compared to other redmi phones. It could be better. finger print lock is not available. Accessibility features not good. In home screen, 3×4 app setting is not there.

"
"

  Good Mobile in its range...but very disappointed to hear that the company will not provide Android updates

"
"

  This is budget phone best for students who are starting online educationIn a country most parents worry that a smartphone is above 10000-20000But this phone is best rated with it's priceI recommend to buy this phoneFull ""paisa vasool phone""

"
"

  I am personally using this device since 3-4 months.Here are some of the key points I want to share.-Quality phone for price.-Camera quality is good-little bit lag while playing pubg-heating problem-display quality is also average

"
"

  Looks good and light weight. Display is colorful but with a prominent yellow tint. China made. Screen lags sometimes and flicker. Camera only good in light.

"
"

  A decent phone with an average specs.But i should say at this price point, its very very good

"
"

  Battery not charging properly. Hence raised a replacement.

"
"

  I am bought the mobile on July month only within one month of purchase network not shown even sim inserted.After mobile restarted only network comes.Regularly notification come that sim toolkit error.

"
"

  Wonderful, super, fatest delivery,i got it within 60 hours of oder,awesome looks nice ,slim,colour perfect .Best mobile .after 15 days i will  once again post my review about performance of the mobile.

"
"

  Battery life and finger print sensor is good but the camera isn't that nice. Built quality is also good storage is nice... Over all its a good pick at this price.

"
"

  In this price rang, this is a good phone. Snapdragon 439 processor is good enough for calling, Video, youtube and other processes.Dual rear camera is very good.Battery is also a plus point for this mobile.Overall its value for money.

"
"

  In a month I have order 2 phone and I am much satisfied with the phone.. Good smart phone in this  budget. I would suggest others too if you want to buy a phone under 8000 rps go for this phone..

"
"

  Power and volume button stopped working after merely 2 months of purchasing the product. Highly dissatisfied as I cannot even go for return or exchange or product after 2 months of buying as per Amazon policy. The phone was not even used much but still is giving problems.

"
"

  ₹75005000mah battery10w fast chargingSupport 18w fast chargingDecent cameraDedicated sim card trayGorilla glass 5Good quality2gb ram32gb internal is good for day to day usageProcessor is also good

"
"

  The touch screen is not that great. I used the phone only for 1 week and started having issues. The screen just doesn't respond to touch I have to switch off n switch on the phone for the touch screen to again work smoothly.

"
"

  Camera quality is above decent but pics come out quite good.Fast charging is helpful in daily use.Design is good.Sd 439 works smooth if you are doing daily tasks.No lag.Gaming is not preferred but light gaming can be done easily.Better than realme c3 or c11.

"
"

  I like this product very much because it gives me lots of feature in low budget.  My advice to others that if they are searching a mobile in Rangel 8-9. Then it is a great product. If fingerprint sensor is given then this will become awesome

"
"

  I got faulty piece because sim slot is not  opened i received it on 13 March and i was stuck in my family issues didn't open that and after 1 month when i opened it sim slot not opening tried several times, i wanted to gift to my mother but now it's useless... Don't buy it.

"
"

  Totally waste products..... Now I have to register on google meet on urgent basis but this stupid ph. Stopped supporting google

"
"

  Product received in good condition and the packaging has also been very good. Overall this product is great value for money. This is something which you can gift your parents in budget with some pretty decent high end specifications.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  This is a best product for a medium user . Great battery life ,great build quality.the only problem is the screen is not full HD . overall good product

"
"

  It's average products not too good or not too badIt's camera quality is poor than mi 5A both mobile 13MP but still this mobile camera is not goodBattery life is average and internal software is also goodWorth for money

"
"

  This is the worst phone, I have ever purchased.1- Since purchase the phone is slow and takes so much time to navigate applications2- Speaker is not working after 5 months of usage3- Camera quality is ok

"
"

  Good battery backup . Nice picture quality but little issue with charging , takes longer time to be full charged.

"
"

  Large screen, dual camera, screen quality not upto the mark but simple use ok....Battery nice....camera quality not great but ok for this price range...no finger print sensor...Overall a decent phone...For normal users Not heavy users.....

"
"

  Picture in YouTube or videos forwards itself, without pressing it, when dragged backwards, it again forwarded without any finger touch.Why type of inferior quality you have send me, it's ridiculous, Return window is also disable..

"
"

  Redmi 8a is a very good smartphone in this price range. I was very happy to purchase this product .battery capacity and all features are good in this price range.thank you for Amazon

"
"

  After 04 days it’s get switched off and it’s not working even now and when I approach to customer service for replacement so now it’s unavailable on that and no other option is their to solve itPlease first check it and then use other wise don’t buy

"
"

  Everything is good like basic usage phone but it has two better features are long battery life and second you can use 2 copy apps in this phoneIf you want it for basic usage then it is very better for you

"
"

  Good product in very cheap price

"
"

  Proximity sensor is not working properly. This is one of the basic feature. I don't know how it was missed

"
"

  Best product in this price but this made in China

"
"

  All good except no finger print and easy to work all good in phone super

"
"

  Good product from Mi.Value for money as every Mi products.Camera is good, battery life is excellent and all other features works properly. The features provided in the mobile is quite good at this price range.

"
"

  i have purchased this 1 week before. one of the better phone for a normal user at this price range, battery backup is awesome...sound quality is nice..and the camera performance is nice also . and thanks for amazon for delivering this with in two days...

"
"

  within this range of devices..it the best with specs and look wise as well..

"
"

  I had found in box _ mi 8a handset (1) _ adapter (1) _ usb type c cable (1) _ SIM eject tool (1)But I didn't get user guides & warranty card..

"
"

  Prompt Delivery by Amazon, this is not for the masses. A good Phone for regular or normal users, please dont expect much. Luckily got the 3GB/64B version.

"
"

  This phone don't finger security and it is not smooth processor ,keep hang,stuck. I don't recommend this model.

"
"

  There is no fingerprint reader.Videos are not opening in this mobile.Really disappointing from Redmi.It is a silly thing that the video should open which is not happening in this mobile which I have received.

"
"

  back Camera is very bad.Front camera is quite good comparing to back camera.Battery is good gives 1 day backup with normal use.Overall I give 3/5I recommend don't buy this phone if your budget is 9k.Purchase any other phones.

"
"

  The Phone Look and Feel does not fell like & 7500 Rupees.. Made in India and Looks are very good.  Matte finish in the back.  Pirchased for my father ans he is very Happy,

"
"

  Though Redmi advertises make in India, the product (3GB, 64GB) I received is Made in China. Also, there is no finger print reader. Otherwise, till now the set is working. Overall, average.

"
"

  Very good phone in a budget

"
"

  Good smart phonecamera goodPrice okBattery backup is goodApp management ok but not goodDisplay good

"
"

  Good, very good battery life.Let's see how long it stays that way

"
"

  at this price ,this its very good configuration.I really impressed by this phones look and working ability. It contain basic features which requires daily bases with quality.

"
"

  Worst mobile, got hardware issue within 13days of buying.. please don't waste your hard earned money on this 3rd class product. Worst experience.

"
"

  Display is averageCamera quality is below averageBattery performance is good as 5000mah 2 day life

"
"

  Touch is smooth and battery life is good . I bought it for my mom and she loves it. Overall camera quality is not that but for this price its reasonable .

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Don't buy electronic items from Amazon.The phone battery is not working .I buied this phone 2 months earlier and the battery is not working.don't know what to do with this.Worst experience of buying a phone from Amazon.

"
"

  I gave gift to my dad he used be mobile all day, the phone performance is really good. Worth for camera and battery life. Display is big in size.I suggest this mobile who not into gaming and photographyFinally thank you Redmi

"
"

  After 10 days it stopped working.. Got switched off and I am unable to switch it on again... Very disappointed, and I am unable to download its invoice, amazon says that it was in order details section but i have not found ...

"
"

  I bought this for my nani maa, it's her first android mobile. Superb

"
"

  Good phone under the budget of 8000 specially after recent price hikes due to increased gst .I havent expected that i could play pubg mobile in 2 gb 32 gb varient. but I am amazed pubg is running smoothly according to this price .

"
"

  It dosen't have finger sensor but face lock is very good and works in night also very effectively. Also it's has very good battery power.  And light weight.  And overall there good thing is it's low prise.

"
"

  The Power Adapter not working, which with the box. Defective product. Do not know how to replace only adapter. Frustrated & disappointed with the quality

"
"

  I think the phone is very good for its price. I got it for Rs 8300 during sale. Also the camera works really well for a budget phone.

"
"

  In this price this product is very good, Camera quality is good, Sound is also clear & Good, And Battery longer is unbelievable in this price.And the last one This White & Light Blue Coloure combination.......Ohhhhh just I Love It❤️  SUPERB👍

"
"

  Received a defective product. The lock button wasn't working properly.The phone comes with 3GB RAM, but it started hanging within a day of purchase, with no heavy apps running in background. Also the headphone jack doesn't work adequately. Please don't your money on this.

"
"

  Valuable product in this priceGood camera quality and battery backupAnd display size is too goodLarge phone in small price.. 😊

"
"

  This set shows good but works bad. Please send me immediately the Warranty papers so that I can go to the Service centre to check up why sound is heard only when speaker is on, as I can't talk to my office, friends and others property.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not there, net connectivity in this mobile is a issue. I checked with Vodafone also used the same sim in other device, it was working fine but in this phone the internet is slow.

"
"

  Exlent product and feture is also goodseller performence ,packing all too good.but Cemra quality is not better i am not happy.

"
"

  I tried the product today as for Covid pandemic, I generally open packet after 72 hrs. Charger is not working. Initially I thought it is issue with the power point. How to replace it?

"
"

  Awesome phone for Rs 7499. Used it 7 days and haven't experienced anything bad about it yet. You can play games Upto 1GB with ease. The Rear Camera is Okay but Front Camera is one of the best in Segment. Sound Quality and Call quality is good.

"
"

  Faulty product dispatched. Audio volume defaults to silent without even touching the device. My request for return has not been honoured. Now I'm stuck with a faulty product. Will be writing to Amazon about this product.

"
"

  Nice and cheap for the price range strong and fast and looks nice

"
"

  Very satisfied till date, but purchased only a month back.

"
"

  Good but not as expected. Little slow

"
"

  Awsome product of redmi 8a dual, because after 10 days used with best features in this range,Camera average good and 8x zooming performance very nice...Best selfie phone with 8 mega pixel..

"
"

  Uncle,We received the mobile.I was happy to hear that it was presented by you.I liked the mobile so muchyou have a kind heart . thank you so much uncle for the present you gave me.You left a big smile on my face😃.

"
"

  Very Bad product, Being a fast charging phone as claimed by manufacturer, it is not able to charge took three hours to charge 1%. Very disappointed by a product having Made in India (may be assembked in India using Chineese components) sticker.

"
"

  Have to exchange the product once , still facing the same issue which faced earlier.While in call, the voice is not clearly audible to the recipient.Used all types of network , but stll the voice is not clear.

"
"

  Speaker sound very good,  performance very good.Airtel sim network not good.Wify very fastCamera not good.

"
"

  Average Performance

"
"

  this product colour exchange company .l like navy blue but recived white colour. No  fingerprint medium camera  battery is so goodBut rate this product 8299 rate high .in this rate hieup best product.this is medium quality mobile phone.

"
"

  Its just not expected from this phone.I gifted it to my younger sister but it not working properly i brought last month. in less than 1 month it started disfunctioning , screen is getting stopped in between. all money gone in waste.

"
"

  Worst mobile in this segment. I bought it 10 days before. Camera is very poor. It hang very badly. Touch is not comfortable.

"
"

  Battery life is goodCamera is not that much coolProcessor is goodAudio level is little bit low...Overall really cool

"
"

  Expecting a decent camera from redmi. But it's worst.If anybody having ""least concern"" about the camera then you should avoid this

"
"

  cost wise it is OKMi apps consuming more spacecamera OKsound is gooddisply is goodgames like pudge, freefire is not goodlittle bit slowThe big disappointment was no charging indicator

"
"

  Nice products 👍Good delivery from Amazon 👍Camera is goodBattery usage is dependent upon personBattery backup is good for normal use.For pubg it's generate heat.For pubg buy 4gb to 6gb ram mobile 👍

"
"

  Good in battery performance look great camera birllent

"
"

  Nice budget phone!Camera is decent in this price range..Processor could be slight better....Battery life is just wow!Build quality just average!Slight gaming and day to day usage of are looking for..best one in this segment...

"
"

  Good product, bought it during amazon prime sale with the discounts. Quite happy how it has turned out to be

"
"

  Dont expect too much,This is a low-medium range phone with adequate battery, resolution and performance.Oaky with daily use.But not for heavy use

"
"

  It's very slow... Even slow than 2 GB. I used ealier redmi for almost 3 years... I purchased this one only on that personal experience. I think you should go with other brand available in market.

"
"

  It's good product to consider in this range.Useful for my dad.

"
"

   Poor quality mobile.

"
"

  Phone is hanging within 10 days, Sim card reader is also not working. Contacted MI customer care in city, they have updated the software but not solved. The worst product of my life. It is like total waste of 7499 to me.

"
"

  Good smartphone with 2D face unlock and it works flawlessly most time.Great camera for the price, could shoot decent images and videos. The phone works smooth enough and loved it.

"
"

  The product is not good. It is started hanging whenever gets the calls. Unable to receive the call we need to restart the cell every time. I tried for replacement but window was closed by 23rd. Kindly suggest and support for replacement.

"
"

  Wrong information given by Amazon that it support volte but I am using Airtel and this device doesn't support Airtel volte services..after cross check with customer care .redmi 8a dual not supported volte...

"
"

  All features are good, camera quality is fine , sound quality and battery backup is good delivery was also fast. I think Indian dealers have already bought products as even chargers had 'made in India' tags😅

"
"

  This is the worst phone ever used,  I bought this phone for my mom and she is not found of phones and usage of phone is very less,  however still phone hangs a lot sometimes it opens and sometime unable to start. Request to pls help in changing this phone

"
"

  3gb ram, 32gb storage, 8mp front and 5k battery.. What else u need in 7k.. Complete value for money and also the sea blue colour looks great.

"
"

  1)Battery life is extremely good2)Display is better in this price range3)Face unlock is very fast and accurate  even in low light conditions4) fast charging is extremely good in this  price5) overall good mobile  and value for money

"
"

  After using for a week, I can say it lags sometime may be due to only 2 GB RAM.

"
"

  I bought for my young brother. Back color is so good, battery and picture quality also good according to this range

"
"

  The product was delivered with mic issue.Calls could only be answered on loudspeaker.Needed software updation and mic settings were done.Now working fine.Headphones were not provided with the mobile.

"
"

  I just got Øne Phone. No dual phone Recieved as promised by Redmi and name tag. Now my friend is in anger. I have to give him my phone otherwise he will beat me to my end#RedmiGiveMeAnotherPhone

"
"

  Poor performance. Started hanging in 2 weeks. Worthless.

"
"

  Its very sad that it desnot support finger print but  ok ok.. face lock awesome.. camera ok ok.. at this prices but battery pickup was really very good.. ❤️ overall it is a best budget phone.. to buy for u mom or dad

"
"

  At Rs6499, you wont ever get this kinda screen resolution.The camera is decent,battery backup is very good. I'm VERY IMPRESSED for its overall performance.

"
"

  Excellent Phone.All functions working fine ...good camera both front & rear...pic quality magnificient..Timely delivery by AMAZON..THANKS.

"
"

  Very nice phone in this price range it's volte and Wi-Fi calling is also there to enhance the voice quality of the call. I like this product very much. nothing to worry just buy it. only camera have to compromise a little bit.

"
"

  Product is good. But did not find the user manual or the warranty card inside the package. Please help me to get these two delivered to me

"
"

  I buy 3GB RAM but some time it's going very slow and hang. All over medium mobile.

"
"

  Touch problem if we call for one person automatically calls other person's( ghost touch) worst mobile in my entire life and manufacturers are telling to go to service center that might be 40-50kms. Is this correct??

"
"

  Buggy softwareTouch not workingDo not even think of buying itLiterally nothing works on this phoneIt's been just 2 days and I'm having the worst possible experience ever.Worst phone ever

"
"

  Very very worst it's defect product send me I started the phone it shows fastboot all most 10 minutes more till waiting.very bad experience this time I will gift to my wife for birthday now I am very disappointed this very very very bad

"
"

"
"

  Recently 19th Aug 2020 Redmi 8A phone got delivered. Today 6th sep 2020 phone is completely getting hanged and could not able to operate the As per Amazon Return policy date is over a week ago. Very upset

"
"

  1. The camera2. Performance3.DisplayBest for the Price range..The speaker is super loud, battery backup is solid. You can easily get 1.5 days for average use.

"
"

  Phone work goodBut little bulkierNot every one wants such big battery phone .So it's suggestions to compony to atlestGive some phoneCompect and light weight for better user experience.

"
"

  Very poor quality product. Touch screen stopped working in 5 days of using. Automattically all apps are operating itself and cannot stop it as screen is operating of its own. Waste of money. Dont buy. Chainese product again proved ****.

"
"

  A little bit lag in phone every time day to day uses. battery life is good. camera quality is very poor am using same price range phone realme c3 . C3 is much better phone in every aspect

"
"

  Worthy for each penny

"
"

  Battery is not charging.Very dissatisfied disappointed customer service 😠

"
"

  Screen strength is a perfect gorilla glass 5 protection. My phone fell almost 5...6 times without by screen guard but still working fine not even easier scratch.  Camera is okok. Phone is a bit heavy coz of battery.  Overall guygug but not a camera phone.

"
"

  Physical appearance is good. Build quality is amazing. Although it is a budget smartphone still it's performance is quite impressive. If you are looking for a smartphone under 8k, I would definitely recommend you this phone.

"
"

  Product is good . Mi is endorsing product as Made in India in ads but this varient is made in china

"
"

  After a 10 days use, it started to hang a lot. It cannot multitask, worse it even struck every single time I opened any app and minimizes automatically. Worst product from amazon. The other things like battery backup and display are okay.

"
"

  Good phone in this price range.As all phone brand have increased price of their phones.But i found only this phone to be better. In this price range. It is a ok phone for normal usageI bought this for my sister

"
"

  there is a problem on sound, some times very low and voice message also.during call getting stuck and need to  restart again for resume call or video cat,there are so many technical issues facing on this mobile,

"
"

  No camera quality,no battery backup, hanging problem within 6days

"
"

  Amazing phoneAmazing perfomanceGreat Camera QualityOne of the Best Mobile at this price range.Loved it...Timely delivery.Well packed.

"
"

  This redmi 8A is really amazing,best battery back,camera quality at this price point is excellent,it would have been better if a fingerprint scanner option would have been there,but it's ok,very satisfying quality

"
"

  Camera quality is too poor as expected. Just like normal camera without pixels. Please do not buy from this seller. Mobile is looks like second hand mobile. Also didn't contain bill and warranty card with mobile.

"
"

  The phone is in frozen state since just 4 hrs of setup usage .... since then .. only freezed handset! Terrible .. terrible phone !!!

"
"

  I was using another Mi Phones and found that if you are buying this on 7,000 then you used probably buy Redmi Note 8Ease of use: 3/5Looks: 4/5My review: 2.5/5I think investing 2k more would be a better option 🤔

"
"

  Best Phone camera better attractive. must have redmi phone

"
"

  This price range good mobile, slightly stuck when multiple task running or playing pubg. But for simple task good.I have attached some photo see camera quality is good on high sunlight, bad on low light

"
"

  This is the most pathetic device I have literally used. This device is not working properly just after 20 days. Mobile network is not working and I am not able to use my internet. It also hangs a lot. Don't buy this mobile

"
"

  Best phone under budget. But camera quality is little dull at artificial light . It's processor is awesome because Redmi gives Android Pie v9.0 operating system with 1.95GHz Snapdragon 439 octa core processor at this rate.

"
"

  Finger print is not there only face lock is availableFinally mobile is good but much wait compare to other mobiles.Charging good.

"
"

  Battery is long lasting. I'd rather say this is the best budget phone and if you're looking for this, don't hesitate to buy it. Go for it! Delivery was well and good 👌Camera features are all average.

"
"

  This mobile is the best at this price the only drawback is that it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, but at this price can't complain

"
"

  Fp reader not provided.. A big drawback.

"
"

  Camera is not that great but phone is okay in this range. But bit slow

"
"

  Value for money. Good for daily usage. Camera is not good.. for some good lighting condition this is okay

"
"

  Very bad experience with redmi. With in a couple of months touchpad problem. I was using samsung galaxy much better than this. 2years used samsung phone is better than this bad box.

"
"

  Overall very good phone. But the name Redmi etched on the face at the centre affecfs the visibility of content. Surprised that a reputed brand has done such a foolhardy thing  inconveniencing the user

"
"

  Very good battery backup, gorilla glass & built quality is Awesome!Overall, the best budget Smartphone.Thank you Xaomi.

"
"

  Good one on this price range, I bought it for my mother and she is very happy and comfortable to handle.

"
"

  After reading all the reviews i booked this mobile for my mom . She loved it . There is little delay in delivery than we expected . The colour is damn cool .battery life is good . Camera quality is good.

"
"

  My product is  defected this phone speaker are not work 😠😠😠😠 amzone is not good sit

"
"

  I had ordered and bought redmi 8A dual mobile before an week.now the charger is not working.very very disappointed from Amazon.camera quality is also worst.personally I really disappointed with this product.dont buy this..

"
"

  very good product in this price .. nice camera .good sound quality .nd good battery backup also ...the package handover to me by amazon is fully sealed nd well packed ..

"
"

  Nothing special, rather in line with redmi 5, which I found to be superior in terms of pic. quality as compared to this 8a version. Screen saver is a welcoming feature with more screen used for display. Overall, a good handset!

"
"

  The phone was very good., and packaging was okay, also delivery was very good,It reached before the delivery date, phone's battery life was also good, and it charged very fastly. 🚀It is better to buy 3gb ram redmi 8A dual.

"
"

  It does not run basic business applications. Also the seller isn't ready to replace it with better phone even though I am ready to spend more. Don't buy anything from this seller.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is missing but face unlock was very much effective. Best for elderly person.Pros - ProcessorBatteryBuild qualityCons - Display (Average)Camera (Below Average)

"
"

  Very bad performance...  camera not good... some apps open automatically.. ..

"
"

  Budget phone with better battery life. takes more than 2.5hrs to full charge.

"
"

  1.Sound is good2.Camera is average3.Gaming experience is good4. Battery is good5.Video quality is goodNo finger print reader

"
"

  I am very much disheartened and disappointed with the performance of the device. It hangs frequently, even using WhatsApp. Either my device is faulty, or its just because of device configuration. 😥

"
"

  After using this phone for one month the main problem was after connecting to a wifi network the phone hanged a lot of times. Even while using mobile data the same problem arises irrespective that 14 gb storage is free

"
"

  Very bad mobile Quality redmi 8 a dual automatic switch on off disply wallpaper automatic change mi service center very very poor service only software update no complate register

"
"

  The phone is really good been using it whole day for work and gaming use it works great without any lack but camera is really not good dosent feel like taking pics from the phone rest all absolutely great even after heavy usage

"
"

  Mobile is very good, battery back up is awsm & highly appropriate your delivery service. During lockdown also I got mobile in 5 days... Superb..

"
"

  Value for money smartphone.

"
"

  The mobile network speed is very bad in comparison with other phones I have. I don't have a full range but still other phones are getting decent speed. But in Redmi 8A i felt the speed is very slow and youtube or Netflix never loads

"
"

  Everything is working, but camera Ducks at big LevelNever buy low graded Cell if you are expecting Good pictures ... At least you should Consider a mid Rangers Cellp..Anyways Sound delivery service by Amazon .. Cheers💓

"
"

   Dislike screen is shaking  as i hav uploaded video of tht....i wanna return the phoneCall me on 9900838222

"
"

  Not worth of 7,500/-. Waste of money. Display is not at all good in this price segment and auto brightness is also not working properly. Don't go for it.

"
"

  i love mi phones because it is always better then samsung, becuase samsung always get hanged i was using M20 got exchanged with this phone better then M20 samsung. go for if but camera will disappoint you little. not clear quality.

"
"

  purchase before 18 days.Only Problem I faced that its not actual work like fast charging other mobiles,It take more time to Charge as compared to Vivo fast charging mobiles,Rest I am using will review after more days.

"
"

   Phone is good, but in my phone display is blinking/flickering, i thought after updating the phone will get normal, but again its blinking. i have gifted this phone to my papa

"
"

  Design-GoodCamera-NiceDisplay-satisfactoryBattery backup-Up to the markOverall-Must to have phone for redmi lovers

"
"

  Worst mobile. China can not make any item which become life log....Samsung is best in comparison of China item.

"
"

  Product is good but charger is damaged... Harassment, at all...They should checked properly.

"
"

  There's no fingerprint sensor and the face unlock does not show up sometimes when I turn on my screen.Performance is kinda doable.

"
"

  Mobile is gud according to battery nd performanceBt camera quality is not upto the markI received mobile without charger

"
"

  Awesome experience. Nice phone. Recommended to everyone . Low price.Nice phone in low budget.

"
"

  Ok to bye, for regular usesg, long battery life

"
"

  Speaker is defective.  Voice output not clear.  Very much disturbabce in the seaker output.  Product need replacement.

"
"

  Nice product and cost efficient.  Correct time product has been arrived within 3 days along with no damage whatever the phne screen or parts so that things iam happy about Amazon. Keep it selling for more products as same as. Thank you.

"
"

  All is good but fingerprint sensor and iR blaster is missing

"
"

  Charging problem take 40min from 1-5%.

"
"

  Very good phone awesome battery life.I've ordered 3

"
"

  Headset port is not working properly...phone is getting heat if v watch YouTube videos...not upto mark .. disappointed

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not available nd camara quality is not enough  good but it's value for money phone in such low price range 😊☺️

"
"

  Got it for 4100 ! Super phone in this range! Super stuff! Does what you ask for! If there would have been any Indian brands in this price range with same specs I would have bought that! But it is still made in India!

"
"

  Every thing featured in the mobile is quite well but it should upgrade its picture quality by improving camera.. Battery life is peerless than that of any other mobile.. Sound quality should also keep in mind. Other wise it's ok.

"
"

  I have returned the 1st delivery for extreme slow charging. But the new one is behaving same. Unfortunately replacement date is over now. Total money is lost. Seems entire lot is defectiv.  Lost faith on this brand

"
"

  Phone is over heating fromvery first day, I am try to retum it to Amazon but the return process are so bad and irretating. I will never use this Amazon to buy anything in future ,first and last mistake done by me..

"
"

  Good

"
"

  No finger print sensor, face lock available. Excellent mobile for the amount paid

"
"

  Worst product with worst camera quality and it is the worst product i have ever purchased in Amazon and if i need a replacement or refund its the worst Customer service provided by Amazon you one Customer amazon.

"
"

  WasteDont buy.. jio sim totally not workAirtel sim also network problemDont buy this mobile

"
"

  I like the phone it is worth the amount, And the delivery is very fast

"
"

  No fingerprint reader. Refused to refund the money. Wrong description.

"
"

  Big display..For normal user not for gaming or photography phone..Large battery..U can call, msg, video call (through WhatsApp) ..What else do u want in 7000/-

"
"

  Overall Phone is Really Good considering the Budget..... No Fingerprint Sensor.... But Face Unlock is available.... Processing is Fast (3 Gb Ram)....camera is average..... Looks Good....

"
"

  I purchase this phone on 26/8/20.today the phone display is not working, just 15 days the phone display gone. Kindly please give me the replacement.

"
"

  While touch the icon for open app screen is minimisizng often.

"
"

   Redmi 8A has ghost touch issues and other touch screen problems.

"
"

  Mother using for 4 months. No issues so far. Camera very good.

"
"

  Very poor battery life this very poor phone I am do not like it this use not order  redmi  this phone very poor

"
"

  I have received defective product. Battery is not charging beyond 55percent .when I tried to replace it no pickup was arranged.instead I was told to courier it with hectic printing of labels and sticking it on return Parcel

"
"

  Network signal are catching very low in hyd city iam using airtel sim but I got 3to4 points of the signal and not that much of internet speed not feeling snapdragon processor cam clarity is not reaches the expectations.

"
"

  I have used this mobile for more than 2 months and I observed that it is a good budget phone. Overall the quality is acceptable and its price make it affordable to common man. Recommend to buy.

"
"

  It is a good phone in this price range.Battery life is excellent last full one day.Camera is some what good.Value for money

"
"

  Return back to my Exchanged product this product not working

"
"

  Firstly phone is good for the rate, camera is not too good compare to other Redmi phones,battery life is too longitivity which comes for 2days but for the rate the phone is good

"
"

  I didnt recieved the proper bill for this mobile i just recieved the carbon printed paper bill i should get my proper bill

"
"

  Don't buy Redmi mobile phones. full of the nonsense Ads

"
"

  There are lots of problem with the phone. Specially calling problem. Incoming call dont show every time. And during outgoing call it shows cannot call as there is a incoming call not answer.

"
"

  This is very bad really bad bad bad bad lroduct plz my dear friend dont waste money 7500 is also big deal.. Its better go for Redmi 9 which is just 6550 rupees cost and far better than this.

"
"

  The phone suddenly switches off twice a day, there is no battery issue, it is under 30 days warrantyBut I can't get any help due to COVID-19situation.

"
"

  By the way the phone is good battery life is also good display is also good . Both camera is also good the phone is value of money..

"
"

  Overall a good complete package. But this phone hangs sometimes. Yes it has this problem.

"
"

  Used this product for one week it's getting factory reset daily two times... every data is deleting continuously...wrist product from redmi.. customer service center is pathetic...they are not even responding..

"
"

  Value for money in this range. Long battery life with 2 n half days battery life.Dhakad look n dhakad body

"
"

  I needed a spare phone in this price range. Does it's job better.

"
"

  Thanku Amazon u never broke our trust on ur service. The product is excellent as expected. And best product in that budget. Thanku for your QOS..

"
"

  Basic phone with good specs for it's price range display could have been better, sound is good..camera is ok for the price... over all 6.5/10

"
"

  It's ok to use.Battery is fine.Made in China.

"
"

  What else can you ask for. It has almost everything except fingerprint scanner. That too without any major issues. Thanks Redmi.

"
"

  This product is really value for moneyEven a type C cable is given with itLoved the colours as wellReally a great product from Xiaomi

"
"

  Good looking, powerful phone with 5000mah battery power enabling to work seemlessly supported by MiUI11 .

"
"

  Fingerprint reader not available in this mobile. But mobile awasome.... Battery backup is too much 👍good

"
"

  Touch problem

"
"

  Processor is very slow.... Takws input with timr lag and hangs sometimes

"
"

  Both of Cameras wasteDisplay avarageGood mobile qualityBattery best...Iam not recommended this productIam sell this phone please msg meOnly hyderabad.

"
"

  Budget friendly stylish and up-to-date android smartphone, Battery backup is very good as expected, Camera is also very good, but there is no fingerprint scanner, though there is face lock facility available

"
"

  Been using it for a while. Good. Just good. At the price range. The NO FINGERPRINT SENSOR is a bummer though.

"
"

  The phone is really value for money but Amazon too it looooong time to deliver the product . I'm really upset with their delivery service but on the other side I'm satisfied with the phone costing me just ₹8000 ♥️

"
"

  Best in this price range. Thank you so much. It's a simple to use & understand...!!

"
"

  VOLTE NOT WORKING SOUND SYSTEM ALSO NOT GOOD

"
"

  Not value for money. In same amount Samsung is delivery very good product. Not value for money

"
"

  Within 10 days the mobile screen got blurred, when I thinking to return the product it is showing as only one week window for return the product. This is the Worst product I ever buy in amazon till now

"
"

  Delivery delayed by one day. Good product in this price range. Camera quality is satisfactory. Battery life is not very good neither unacceptable. Good network. Over all good product, you can go for it.

"
"

  Charging is very slow, &Charger is heating Very much when mobile phone is on charging. I want solution from redmi Or amazon.And one more thing amazon didn't give me gorrila glass with this phone.

"
"

  Got it on an exchange price of 4500 only....can complain works gr8....only problem is made in china....but in this range no other indian, korean company is giving the phones...so........!

"
"

  Dear sir, This phone shows abnormal performance. while working, tab automatically disappear and closes all tabs instantly.Plz suggest to return or exchange this product immediately.Brajesh8847498812

"
"

  Not worth it.

"
"

  It has a rubbish camera. Clicking very dull picture

"
"

  I liked all the qualities of this phone. Instead the sound quality. Its sound quality is not much as I've expected. Due to this I am unable to notice any notifications. Whenever I play music the speaker's place heats up.

"
"

  Hi All,Don't buy this redmi 8  , it's very worst phone, I'm facing So many issues1.camera quality ok2.Mobile hanging multiple times per dayThanksLokesh vemula

"
"

  Good for the price. Would've been a steal if it were around 7k

"
"

  No fingerprint. Thats not an issue since it has face unlock. Display is awesome as well as the battery. Sturdy design. Type c. I got it at rs6999,the very next day it increased to rs7299

"
"

  Poor camera quality, does not has a finger scanner which is offered by many brands at this price range.

"
"

  Hi there is no fingerprint reader and good think is that is has fast charger

"
"

  Don't buy this... Every time i m doing anything its showing me the home screen again and again.. Lagging within 20 days of buying... waste of money.. so disappointed..

"
"

  In 7000/-rupee it's a nice phoneBattery is very good 5000mahFingerprint sensor also very goodEverything is fine but camera is just okk

"
"

  Good product within the price range.Can even play PubG on this one. Value for money. Good display. Sound could’ve been better if you are playing something on the speaker.

"
"

  Finger print reader, full battery charge indicater and notification light not provided. It is a major draw back. Face reader is working. Battery life is good.

"
"

  Good phone, Nice and slim. Battery power is very good. Both the cameras deliver stunning quality.

"
"

  I purchased this phone 2 months back but there is some kind of problem with the Bluetooth. It starts automatically by itself again and again. It is still in warranty. Amazon please help me with the service

  I have complaint about software. I brought 7th sept. On 18th software crash. Rebooting fault. All my datas lost. I want to replace it. Even in service centre employee advice me that this device has problem

"
"

  The touch screen is not responding properly. It's a slow process.

"
"

  Camera quality is very good and easy to use and color is awesome, battery gets charged very fast.

"
"

  Absolutely great 👍 phone in this price range. Camera, Display, Battery all are excellent. I give 4 🌟. 1 🌟 negative out of 5 🌟 because there is no fingerprint unlock option.

"
"

  Phone quality is good, I'm facing problem with cast feature, even a downloaded video playing like buffer.Please sort it out in next update as I replaced mobile, still facing this issue in New phone as well.

"
"

  Be reminded that this does phone not have the common micro usb port, it has a different kind of port called type-c port. also you can not connect a micro usb flashdrive. Does not have fingerprint reader, but has facereader only.

"
"

  Really worth money phone this is. The feel and the comfort is really awesome. Grey colour looks nice and good.

"
"

  Average . price is too high. Very funny to note that amazon boy doesn’t accept my exchange mobile. Very small problem in mobile. Still he don’t agree. Little bit disappointed

"
"

  Super Amazing product with lots of features. Build qualify is super as all Redmi phones. No issues in using. Nice Camera in the prize range.

"
"

  Received a phone with manufacturing defect the battery was drained in less than 3 hours of usage even after 100% charge. I tried calling amazon customer support but their response was pathetic.

"
"

  Good

"
"

  Very worst experience. Charger is not working. This is the second time I'm facing same problem. Last time I ordered and replaced the item due to defective of charger and again the new one also having the same problem

"
"

  Phone looking beautiful 😍 Sea blue.Battery life and featuresDesign in this price segment are awesome 👍👌.. Go for it.

"
"

  Very poor quality of mobile. My mistakes for purchasing this product. Hanking issue, battery backup very low.I suggest no neet purchase this product.

"
"

  Excellent mobile under this budget priceSpeed performance and camera cleatity is extremely superb

"
"

  I brought 2gb 32gb varient a month ago,sometinn faceing slowness or hang issue.Battery life is goodCamera quatily so so

"
"

  Delivered phone not getting switched on. Amazon support not allowing me to return.  Never ever buy mi phones. i thought of buying MI phone for 1st time, but very bad experience.

"
"

  Camera good  no fingerprint battery fast charging mobile look good. Price affordable

"
"

  It's just a basic mobile at budget price. The features are so simple but quite niceAt this price point it is a nice phone by Xioami !!

"
"

  Battery is bad , camera and another function is ok.

"
"

  Good phone at its price in comparison to other brands.

"
"

  Battery backup is best in this phone. Volume is also loud. Finger unlock is missing in this device. It should be. Otherwise it is value of money device.👍

"
"

  As per price this is good. The only bad things is already instol some app which is not use by us and there is no any option for deleat this app.Battery good.Camera good.

"
"

  Moto phones have much better battery at same price...battery charging taking too much time  ..only 5%in 1 hr.. cant ask for finger print at this price...so giving 3 star.

"
"

  Battery life is good and the shape of phone is good but the camera quality is not bad but not very good and occurred ghost touching is the big problem.

"
"

  All features are good but camera little bit not good.

"
"

  We have facing lot of hang it issue with this mobile auto  display not properly work I think Amazon give me used mobile really disappointed Amazon ..At least not excepted from you really sad

"
"

  Good looking but no finger print scanner

"
"

  Battery smartphone this price range

"
"

  Recommended at this price range..the only problem is that the camera takes longer time to auto-focus & adjust according to the lighting.

"
"

  My new phone redmi 8 a not a good parfoorms, hanging problem, then display on screen top side show head phone symbolls but i can't connect headphone so no lissan sound without head phone. And very slow phone. i am unhappy.

"
"

  Best battery, decent camera, overall ultimate budget phone out of the box........Really  #Damdaar phone

"
"

  It is good smart phone that is why you have raised the Price 😂🤣 and if anyone wants to buy this go directly to the MI site and buy there is only Rs 7449... Good job Amazon

"
"

  Not as expected.. 6A is better than it

"
"

  Good camera...Good mobile if thinking to gift your mom and dad...

"
"

  Worst phone i have ever purchased bad quality camera and battery charging speed is very slow  full waste of money never buy this phone and Amazon is not going to return or replace this phone

"
"

  Buy 3 GB & 32 gb only and then you can add sd card of 32 gb

"
"

  Very bad quality

"
"

  Phone is good. Camera is very slow. When you click a pic, it will start to adjust the focus before capturing. By the time the objects will move and the image will be out of focus

"
"

  Features are limited compared to samsung in same price

"
"

  happy with the phone in this price range.

"
"

  Battery and signal and speed of phone working is good.  But one time  the phone display  was fully blanked,  looking fully white display.  After a reboot,  the phone was working normally.  It is a failure model?

"
"

  Mobile working qulity was worst because many inbuilt app forces u to download update them if u deleted that thane u r mobile getting start problems  so don't buy this mobile phone

"
"

  Excellent product.. .. .Ordered it before lockdown.. At only 6999/-(3/32 )

"
"

  Charger is not serviceable, unable to charge Mobile through this, same charger once used on other phone then also not working, means charger is defective. Please replace with new one and get old one back. Thanks.

"
"

  Brilliant updated mobile in an affordable price. Camera quality and battery backup is awesome. Screen colour, sound quality & charging speed is good. One must definetly buy this Mi phone for MIUI Globle version experiance.

"
"

"
"

  I received the redmi 8A mobile, in that instead of ""redmi"" name on front side, only ""redm"", 'I' was missed, this is a Big mistake in manufacturing Company. How that QC checking and passed.

"
"

"
"

  Very bad, Don't buy this specially from Amazon. They have very bad return policy. You can never retur it.Touchpad working automatically. This is my Last product from Amazon as well as Xiaomi.

"
"

  Best budet mobile for first Andriod users.

"
"

  Price is higher than Mi stores available at 7499/Seller is always quating higher rates  Thereis no prime sale benefitsUSB Charger is not workingCable is good s

"
"

  Only drawback is no finger print reader, rest all perfect phone

"
"

  NiceExcellent soundShort video recordingCamera clarity is very nice

"
"

  Seal already opened one side. Worst package. No cover seal for box. I think i got the used one.

"
"

  There should be a back cover given in the box.No ir blaster.No fingerprint reader.

"
"

  We have taken the phone on march1st2020 and within 1 month the display is not working. We are trying to contact the amazon but we are not get any response from them. The worst customer support which we seen in recent days.

"
"

  The battery life of this phone is horrible. Have to keep constantly charging it

"
"

  Nice product with great battery backup...

"
"

  This is worse phone I have saw, both camera quality is very very bad. THERE IS NO RETUND POLICY FOR MOST OF THE PHONE on Amazon, they making people fool so thinks twice if you wish to buy phone on Amazon.

"
"

  It's a very good phone for beginners to invest on a smart phone...also based on the same price features offered by Xiaomi is awesome.

"
"

  After 1 month some of its icons are opening without attempt. When You opened a App than another app start opening by default. What should i do ???Not a good phoneSuch a waste of money

"
"

  The product is good for this moneyGood camera and the phone is stylishI like this product overall it is a good phone for normal use and play medium games and to take medium photos ✌✌✌

"
"

  Great phone for the price. But the ram is a little low for 2020 usage. Safe delivery too. Camera is decent not trash not great either. Great for general usage.

"
"

  Just received new mobile, found battery damaged, it took more than 12 hours to come to 100% full charge.

"
"

  The phone is superb at this price range.there is no lags .I am use this phone from 2 weeks.the battery backup is good.the only problem with this phone is there was so many preloaded app

"

"
"

  Nice packaging, budget phone, thanks to Amazon.

"
"

  I like the phone.but I dislike that phonedoes'nt have back cover. Ear piece and warranty/guarantee card

"
"

  Overall it is a good phone with great battery life. I didn't like the camera quality, could have been better. But you can't expect much from 7.5 K phone.

"
"

  Very Nice Mobile in this Range. Serves my purpose... Good Advance and Basic both Functions...

"
"

  Its already hanging within 10 daysReturn window got closed 2 days back, otherwise we would have done it

"
"

  Battery life is very good....this phone will give lag if you play games like pub g and cod.... processor of this phone is not that good

"
"

  Camera quality is worst both front and rear camera are not too good. Display is average, loudspeaker are of low quality.

"
"

  Decent Mobile Phone,  Screen is not that good feels Little faded, go for another options if possible.

"
"

  Good set in this segment and prices

"
"

  Nice budget phone.. Battery backup good. Camera quality super. Little weight because of 5000mah battery.

"
"

  This phn comes with apecia feature of irritating inbuilt ads and lots of unwanted apps. The 2gb ram is not at all effective.Even youtube can't be opend sometimes.

"
"

  Nice Phone But price is increased in COVID 19 lockdown, before lockdown price was very much low.Phone is good, nice experience, value 4 money, nice camera, smooth running, no heating, battery life is awesome...

"
"

  This phone is really osm....with excellent battery life ever seen....nd good picture quality.... features are good...and stunning look...good processor also used for gaming.

"
"

  Battery goodcamera quality not goodGood perfomance

"
"

  I just received a half bill. I mean the bill is not complete. The Price description is just missed from this bill, plz tell how can I download the bill.

"
"

"
"

   I got this mobile on 23/072020 but this mobile was used since one year which is clearly seen in youtube history. Totally fraud I will complaint in consumer forum

"
"

  It is a good Budget phone for beginners. Can't expect much in this price range. Battery life is quite good but camera picture quality is very bad.

"
"

  It's been 4 months since I purchased this phone for my mom. From around last 15-20 days , screen suddenly blacks out and goes to home screen. Happens every 10 minutes. She's Kind of annoyed because of this.

"
"

"
"

  Not satisfied with this phone, performance very bad , camera is very bad, hang issues

"
"

  I think it should have the latest android version. There are so many pre installed useless app that can't be uninstall. This is annoying. Fingerprint sensor is not given. Otherwise its a good product.

"
"

  One of the best at this price segment. I'm using and i suggested for my 2 friends. Fast charging and good battery pickup. Mi ui. Very good mobile in this price. Tq

"
"

  Great selection . I liked battery backup.easy to handle and comfortable.i think there's no negative.awsome.

"
"

  App search and app menu is not available. Hangs when you play even the mobile default games back to back.Camera and battery is good.Overall okay product. Useful only for elders.

"
"

  Very bad quality. though Battery have 69% charge, but shows 0, Mobile set's temperature increasing. sometimes it hangup also. Please send some one to return this product. I need a good quality mobile.

"
"

"
"

  1. Camera is decent according to price.2. Battery is amazing.3. Speaker loudness and quality is good.4. Display is good.5. Phone looks good. Design is good.

"
"

  Not good not charging after 1month

"
"

  Fingerprint reader is very excellent & battery life also very excellent & camera quality is very good

"
"

  Highly recommended. It has good quality compared with its price

"
"

  Redmi smartphones are good but only one things which I don't like. So much annoying add pop up which I think Xiaomi can control.

"
"

  Get only 22 GB space instead of 32 GB as mentioned in product specifications. Is it the case same with all esdmi 8a dual or i am the only one to get a damaged one.Please replace it.

"
"

  I like it , it does not have any finger printBut face lock is very good . Its have  5000 mah long life battery and owsome camera quality . Its processor working very fast.

"
"

  Overall is good at its price. But camera is not good. Look like 2 MP camera. Not clear

"
"

  Phone is too good, no heating issue till now , but phone is little bit slow and some time hanged. Keyboard automatic start typing. You can not off that app and not start a new one

"
"

  Gud product but without fingerprint sensor battery is durable and camera quality is average gud....It's Good not best

"
"

  Phone became very slow. ordered the product for my father, delivered on 27 th july. return date is august 6th. but phone got slow after 10th. so not eligible for return.

"
"

  Totally Bakwash phone....... Plz don't buy .. while unlocking pattern lock it is lagging.... Garbage..?.!!

"
"

  The phone is best at this price point with its high battery efficient but the only problem is it ur made in china if it had been made in India it could be more effective at this price point

"
"

  phone built, display is good. call quality and loud speaker very good. camera is average. good for older people.

"
"

  Product is excellent like me very much. My relatives very happy with your product

"
"

  Thankyou Amazon for providing such an amazing phone at such a reasonable prize. I absolutely  loved it.I would suggest the prospective buyers to go for it without having any second thoughts.

"
"

  Redmi 8a is a very good  mobile

"
"

  After 1 month of use, the display had a problem and all the apps stopped working suddenly.Poor quality of manufacturing.

"
"

  Awesome phone!! Go for it if you are a basic user and does nt play games.

"
"

  Mobile hot spot automatic shutdown .Message displayed is your mobile got heat .Hot spot not work continuous 1 hour.It's very disappointed me.

"
"

  Good product , and till have no issues and have proper battery backups , and able to use multi apps with 3gb ram config

"
"

  It is a good mobile in this budget and nice respond is there so that people  can buy it . It is not very costly.I have used this mobile since 2 month. It is responding better.

"
"

  The best mobile is, it should not be forgotten, the most important thing is not to shop at Amazon at all, the product does not listen to Amazon at all after delivery, they also do insults

"
"

  I ordered this item and with in 2 weeks the phone is not working.  Its not switching on at all .  Intially it worked but with out any reason it stopped working and customer service is bad

"
"

  Everything is good in this phone . But with my set there is a major error coming and that is the phone is facing a severe network issue during voice call and video call

"
"

  I purchased oppo f1s @18000 3/32 gb on 6.1.17 till now I didn't purchase any mobile. Now I purchased redmi dual 3/64 gb @9000 on 14.7.20. I'm satisfied with this phone and with amazon. Thanks

"
"

  Bought as a gift for my mother....she needed all basic & smooth smartphone functions so I opted for 2gb Ram. Its really good with in the budget range. Looks very cool.

"
"

  The specs deliver their best performance in a budget phone.Happy with my choice and love the color.

"
"

  The exchanged Redmi note 8 smartphone now working properly... software is very vital to operate smartphone ..all we need it  perfect.

"
"

"
"

"
"

  Very dissatisfied......after 1 month it's not working, screen touch is  very bad ...I am very disappointed.. it's defective product and they do not return or replace..

"
"

  phone is hanging

"
"

  I have purchased this mobile after lockdown & it's price is 1000 more but the phone worth the money. speakers are of good quality. If you have budget of 8000 then go with this mobile.

"
"

  Poor quality phone not advise to buy

"
"

  I am very very dissatisfied with the product. Would never suggest anyone to buy this ever. It hangs so much that I can't even do simple things on it. I want u guys  to replace it anyhow. Or give me a refund. Plz I insist

"
"

  Mother board dead within 15 days of purchase

"
"

  this phone comes with very nice specifications under this prize rangeBuilt quality is very good midnight grey colour looks richBattery is awesome , display is good and camera is average

"
"

  In between 8000 range its a perfect quality mobile.. In day to day life there is no problem. Battery performance good n you can play free fire on ultra mode no issue.. Go for it

"
"

  Phone touch functions without actually touching..Automatic opening apps.. and we can't do anything unless we restart. The problem started after just 1 month from the purchase date

"
"

  Battery life is very poor in comparison with 5000 mah, and all well

"
"

  The phone always hang ,screen is zoom in or out automatically sometimes automatically keypad is working.And sometimes screen is off abruptly.Don't waste money on buying this product.

"
"

  Very, nice phone. This phone is very good. Runs smooth but sometimes not I think it's my problem. Everything is nice. Esay to play free fire no lag. Trust me go for this. Charing is also very good.

"
"

  I was purchased this phone on 2 week ago, but this phone is quite good and budget phone also. This phone is amazing quality and good camara, with handy feature phone. I like this phone

"
"

  I got this phone only for Rs 3200 after exchange of my old phone . Blue colour is amazing. It looks like premium phone .I bought one back cover and display glass for Rs 70+80 =150 from local market.

"
"

  Now the product working nicely

"
"

  this phone is awsm look like this price awsm deal quality is better for this rate screen size is good nice product

"
"

  Voice always breaks when we turn on speaker on calls, we made service also even though it is working same, now we don't have warranty also on that, first time disappointed with MI mobile

"
"

  Dear Team, Thanks a Lot. God Bless.

"
"

  I am writing this review after 1 month  of use this phone, it is not a good phone,Hanging problem, camera is also not good, TV Apps not working properly, some time speaker problem

"
"

  Ten watts standard charger that is received in the box is not charging the phone properly. It charges for sometime and stops. Otherwise every other phone functionality meets expectation

"
"

  Even the display light goes off and on, Music stops.. Now I cannot return this piece as there is no return policy. I think, I need to take it to the service center, which is a big pain.

"
"

  Decent phone if you don't play games or do high performance tasks, as all redmi phone it comes with a lot of bloatwares,Battery life is good, charging speed is nice,Camera is decent

"
"

  Very good mobile. Excellent features in this range.

"
"

  Worth product for the money

"
"

  Great mobile for value

"
"

  This is a pathetic phone first they said they will take it return if there are problems now they are saying return window is closed. Very bad product hangs everytime.  Doesn't work at all.  I want to return this item

"
"

  Mobile cant detect any hotspot..wifi problem..heat problem...gets hang many times just in week..fraud product

"
"

  This is a good product and thanks to amazon delivery, before one day than expected the product was delivered.

"
"

  Overall for day-to-day task this phone is good but processor is slow not good for the one who is looking to play games on this mobile. Sound quality is great.

"
"

  Nice product. You can buy it. I like this phone very much. Camera is also good. Battery life is very high. I love it. It is good phone for this range of money.

"
"

  Under the budget phone quality is excellent

"
"

  Nice product to gift those parents having habit of keypad phone. They can understand its functions easily.

"
"

  The phone is truely amazing. It's look is mindblowing i have it's sea blue colour which really looks owsme. The only problem with the phone is there is no any back cover with it......

"
"

  I bought this last month. Camra quality is very bad and when hanging problem also. When I using something automatically come to main screen...Not satisfied with this product.

"
"

  PROS:1) Good Battery Life2) Good Looks3) No heating4) No hanging issueCONS:1) Camera could be a lot better, doesn't live up to expectation

"
"

  please don' buy this phone.the ghost touch you will feel when usingitem defective received

"
"

  Should have provided back cover & fast charger. Good for normal usage. Not for the gamers. Build quality is good. White colour stands out.

"
"

  Nice colour,nice phone display touch nice value for money but slow delivery it's takes delivery timeline 15 days but it is is near but not come phone is nice but delivery time is slow

"
"

  Headset profile is selected automatically, sim card do not catch range need to change slot.. these problems faced within a month of purchase.Either battery ok

"
"

"
"

  Very good performance of the phone and 🔋 backup also very good thank you for giving good product Amazon

"
"

  Product is ok, but there was not clear hard copy invoice of it with the phone pack. I even can't find any option on Amazon to get a print of it. How do I get an invoice of the same?

"
"

  Mobile is good .best battery back up .find no issue after using more than 3 months.Main issue is privacy, some application ban by the government but it is not remove by company

"
"

  First time i was very unsatisfied with redmi brand. Very poor camera. And 18w charger not included in pack.. No back pouch.. Which was provided by another brands..

"
"

  No fast charging options only fakeCharging time 2 hours or 30 min hWeight is very high

"
"

  Worst Chinese Mobile

"

  very nice phone but lacks fingerprint scanner only

"
"

  1)Facelock is not working properly2)Unlock with any other face 😂3)Phone is bit slow4) battery backup is good but charger is slow in the box ,it takes too much time to fully charge

"
"

  Best budget range phone..... Not for pubg but other games working smoothly.... Camera also good..... Best battery life ever😍😍😍😍💞❤️ best for everyday usage...

"
"

  It's a very basic phone to be used for just calls and a little bit of social media, you cannot use this for gaming purposes because of the ram but it still has some hanging issues

"
"

  Very bad👎 mobile automatically, stuck and screen change and number immediately and names changed,and automatically names big sige wrost

"

  Awesome buy at given price, mi phones are really value for money.

"
"

  It is a good mobile for the price paid. Happy with it.

"
"

  Very bad mobile phone, facing signal issue everytime, when I change my sim to another phone it work well, but when I insert in this phone, no network. 📡Antenna of this mobile phone is very week.

"
"

  Charger cable is not universal. Rest all good

"
"

  Good mobile in the budget.

"
"

  Reversment your product,redmi8A product is a bad products, Some hanging not good networking.

"
"

  Finger print is not given but shown in the picture.Colour has changed of phone which I have ordered

"
"

  Very disappointed with this product.Basic need is to make a call and that is only not fulfill in this product.Not able to call from my home, that is not an issue in my old mobile.

"
"

  Brought for my sister she is satisfied,  Good mobile in this price range for normal use, u can go for it

"
"

  Pretty decent product for normal users, not recommended for power users. Not the best phone out there, but it will get the job done with a good pricing as well.

"
"

  Finger Senser is not Available in this Device as a Security purpose.But According to price this Device is better.Good processor & work is also good.

"
"

  Best phone in this price range.

"
"

  Charger very low quality ans solo

"
"

  I bought Rs.6500Very good productBattery lifer AmazingNormally usage 2-3 days

"
"

  So talking about phone it's great...... It's very usefull for those people who generally travel because it consists 5000mhap battery..... OP phone in 9000 well xiaomi...

"
"

  No problem with the product but price matters

"
"

  Camera quality very good Battery back up up to the mark over all very good product value for money

"
"

  Mobile is good....but really upset with delivery.... They didn't come on time, didn't answer the call, we went to him to take our package... First and Worst experience with Amazon delivery...

"
"

  The product is good with very good battery life.

"
"

  Look like designing good inThis price really I appreciate the xiaomi phone

"
"

  This mobile is good for average use.Battery backup and camera is quite good.Snapdragon Processor is also fast. Faced no problem as of now.

"
"

  It switched off after using only 2 days without any battery issues. Face lock not works properly. It switch off 2 times between 18 hours with battery percentage above 40℅ . Worth of money

"
"

  I got default piece.only used 15 days.phone got hanging,processor problem.

"
"

  Best gift for my mother.....❤️

"
"

  Very nice purchase, worth for money. I miss only fingerprint scanner and the IR bluster here. If they were present in this device this could be the best phone in this price segment.

"

  For this range it's  very good phone.

"

  Front camera is poor as compared to latest version phones. Not so clear video calls..looks and feel is awesome.One of the best phone under 9k for 3+64 version.

"
"

"
"

  The phone has everything yku could ask in this budget...Budget friendlyNice battery backup

"
"

  Budget phoneFor beginners they can buyDisplay clarity not good as expectedSimilarly camera also need to be improvedBattery life is goodHeadphones not included

"
"

  Entry-level smartphoneAvarage quality

"
"

  The touch screen is not working from Day1. No option to return the phone. A grand fraud in the name of Grand sale. Selling faulty goods in the name of deals. Hopeless

"
"

  Worst product received from amazon blur camera , lines coming on screen & mobile hangs after every 15 min . All this problem starts after 15 days of use so now I can not return product.

"

"

  Good use Redmi 8AThanks Amazon.

"
"

  Received a Damaged Charger (it wasn't charging) I had a bad experience with the Amazon team for the first time.The product sent back to the Amazon Address and waiting for further actions.

"
"

  I just bought this phone 1 month back and all of a sudden finger print sensor is creating problem. Without even touching the screen it clicks on it own and opens any application.

"
"

  My mi 8a phone, display ghost touch problem, automatically phone touched.This products Amazon site not replace.Amazon worst online shopping site

"
"

  Very poor performance, product name Redmi fixed at the centre on display, 'mi' on right side corner, self not happy with this set, better I'll go for higher rate mobile by returning this

"
"

  Got this in 4,800 in exchange offer. Everything is perfect, there is no lag. Display is very good. But battery drains relatively quickly to redmi 7a. Everything else is good.

"
"

  Worst Experience.I'd bought this product on Aug 7, 2020 and today(Aug 8, 20202) facing display issue.Even I can't replace this product as cancellation time period is over.

"
"

  Redmi 8A is a good quality mobile. Thanx a lot amazon your service is very fast.. i  am very appriceat... your service......... 😊  😊THANK YOU AMAZON😊

"
"

  Battery life is not as expected. It lasts one day hardly.

"
"

  This phone is just amazing.Touch is tooo good. A best budget phone with 5000 maH battery. At first battery will drain., but after 2-3 days battery backup will be gud

"
"

  Good mobile in budget category

"

  Display, performance, battery, camera everything is good. I don't wanna gv 5 ⭐bcoz dealer will increase the price

"
"

  Nice camera qualityGood battery lifeNo fast charger provided need to purchase separately.Normal charger provided. 5v 2A charger only.

"
"

  Too many Useless Apps coming inbuilt which cannot be uninstalled. After seeing those many Apps, I decided not to buy any of the Redmi brand phone.

"
"

  It very good product for the price, only fingerprint sensor is missing in its feature, battery life is very good and camera quality is not that bad overall the product is satisfied

"
"

  Simply and awasome products.

"
"

  Budget mobile

"
"

  Bought this for my mother , she loves it and also i have checked the camera quality and battery charging ..totally its good and budget friendly..

"
"

  It is a good mobile for normal use but if we do some heavy work so it starts to lag and by the company its given 3 gb ram but the performance is not up to the mark

"
"

  Good for basic work , not for heavy uses

"
"

  It's good not for gaming purposes

  Low camera quality ....can't say it has 13 mp camera 5 mp camera even better than this.Even Battery is only to say 5000mah.I am very upset after purchasing  this phone.

"

"
"

  A descent product with amazing style.It has awesome features and mind blowing battery life.picture quality is average.

"
"

  Based on good review of redmi 8 used by my spouse I have purchased this redmi 8A dual and it seems to be a good deal.After using for some time actual review may be given.

"
"

  Its a good product. But there is no finger print sensor.otherwise battery life is bestIf are you want to buy this product.. go for it. In this price range its good.

"
"

  Not as expected like earlier models

"
"

  nice product, value for money.suitable for limited use and for parents as it has a larger battery life ... got it as an exchange for old mobile

"
"

  Best price and best phone but I face battery issues and I change some settings and it's solved and lot of mi apps.over all good and value for money.

"
"

"
"

  Received the item with different charger set. It has quick charging but not showing with its charger. Quick charger shows with the different charger.

  Please take back the phone because when phone put charging it take hours to recharge i.e it take one hour only 36% and also getting to much heat producing

"
"

  Nice mobile

"
"

  No fingerprint readerBattery life bestCamera quality is good

"
"

  My phone was delivered on 21 Sept 2020 and suddenly it went dead shutdown on 26 Sept. I complained of the same to amazon and still waiting or its inspection from amazon.

"
"

  Liked the product great exchange value on amazon

"
"

  Overall good phone but slightly expensive. I bought redmi 7 last year with 3gb Ram 32gb rom and SD 632 for the same price. Not great for moderate use.

"
"

  This handset is using our daily data without even informing us . It is totally ridiculous to use such a handset which ends up using your whole data that without even informing you!

"
"

  Awesome

"
"

  Seller has sent me mobile with software problem.You can not download YouTube also.Phone is good but seller is not good

"
"

  No fingerprint facility,it's very disappointed, battery life satisfied &camera not a HD.

"
"

  I'm quite satisfied with the product however my suggestion would be that the camera quality can be improved further.

"
"

  There is no fingerprint scanner

"
"

  Very good product

"
"

  Best performance

"
"

  All is okay

"
"

  awesome value for money

"
"

  No finger print reader and very heavy as compared to other mobile with same battery and price.

"
"

  Very good productNice appearanceGood quality and big screen

"
"

  There is no bill with itFor warranty issues

"
"

  Under 10000 best phone, value for money product highly recommended go for it don't buy another like realme c11,c3 because processor is worst helio over heated processor

"
"

  Hitting the mobile when calling

"
"

  Type C Fast charging support with bigger battery..... Thats what u all need for ur basic daily work in this price range. In fact talking about camera, it is quite good

"
"

  Sorry but the cell delivered to me is not as per expectation. Device is not charging, there’s extreme lag in processing. V poor experience overall, might be manufacturing defect in my device.

"
"

  Value for money product.

"
"

  Fantastic phoneAt lower priceAm impressedUI  might not be acceptable .Overall good product.

"
"

  Fingerprint sensor is not available and the camera Quality is not as too good, otherwise this phone is this range is Simply Good.

"
"

  Under 10,000 this mobile is good.Value of money.Quality (display,camera,battery,) too good.Overall mobile performance is too good.

"
"

"
"

  Camera quality bad no biuty camra battery backup two day  torch Light is normal no led Light,fingerprint not available speaker big sound. Purchase 8999/-

"
"

  Battery is just normal...for a normal user one day battery backup is enough.... camera quality is not soo good in 7500 price of mobile.....for rough tough use..it's nice one..

"
"

  Good product at this price.... What else do you need.... Can play any game in it.... Pubg... Mobile legends... Review after using 8 days...

"
"

  I bought this phone in July, not even 2 months in and it has already started hanging. Even the storage is not full yet. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this phone.

"

  I bought this for 7400 and I didn't expect much frm this but as I use it it is very smooth and camera quality isnt bad....u can play pubg also and it doesn't lag much

"
"

  Redmi 8 A Dual is not worth in buying with a very poor quality /functionality.it hangs most of the times and it ill not pick the location even when the GPS is on.i will not recommend to buy this.

"
"

  Good product but redme has increased the price of the same quality mobiles

"
"

  Good phone, good battery, camera is also better than other single cam phones,Portrait mode  depth effect is a hit or miss, rest photo mode is good and great.

"
"

  In the product specs screen is mentioned as AMOLED but actual screen of this mobile is IPS LCD.

"
"

  Wrost product, amazon customer service support also Wrost . Amazon not accepted return this item. This product performance not good. Don't waste your money.

"
"

  Good one. Balu for money

"
"

  Worst product, Worst Amazon service, it not working properly, automatic type and autuomated many functions, no hard reset function available on this phone and Amazon has not returned it. 😔

"
"

"

  Excellent product, looks great and is very smooth. Good build quality. Great value. Super fast deliver by Amazon.

"
"

  Phone hangs alot. Camera is too bad. Only battery backup is good. Face recognition is not good in low light. No fingerprint. I will not recommend you this product.

"
"

  Charge very slowly

"
"

  The Phone Takes Messed Up Photos. It Lags while Scrolling, the funny thing is all this is happening in the first day itself. I'll Recommend You Guys To Buy Realme C series.

"
"

  Cannot except much from this price. Not functioning as mentioned

"
"

  Its battery is good you can exhaust but its battery cannot exhaust but its camera is not upto the mark at this range this phone is the better option

"
"

  Not satisfied because this mobile network signal strength is very low ,internet connectivity also compared to other same brand mobile other options are normal

"
"

  Product is good at this budget.. camera is good ..battery stays for long.. but gets a litte hot.... And the charger too..

"
"

  It's very nice my daughter loved the phone she is so happy her happiness make me happy😊😊😊

"
"

  Don't buy this productI bought this product just Before 5days it's really disappointing the touch function doesn't work so please skip this phone and chose a better phone

"
"

  Very good Mobile.

"
"

  Ok

"
"

  The quality of the camera is very low, the backup of the battery is also not good, because the phone is very hot due to running 2-3 hours of continuous operation.

"
"

  Battery backup good

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  I had planned to gift to my relative. Received Samsung charger in the box. The return window is closed, what to do?

"

  this phone is perfectly amazing but there is one issue with it is that it is not having a fingerprint scanner but it's ok because it is having face unlock feature.

"

  A good phone for day to day use.

"
"

  Battery life is awesome and build quality is also good but the look and feel is fantastic. I bought this phone for my father and he love it.❤️

"
"

  I faced problem with its charging.

"
"

  Excellent

"
"

  Very disopointed ... Bad product receive ... So much error in operatting system .. faulty piece ... Amazon this is not excepted from you 😡😠

"
"

  I am charging it from last 7-8 but the battery is only 8%  . I want to replace this product there is some defect in it . In 7 hour of charging only 8%

"
"

  Back camera is not good. My previous redmi model 3s prime gives much better quality than this phone camera. This product doesn't meet my expectations.

"
"

"

"
"

  Nice in 9000 rs

  I am sad because this product is made in China.I considered buying made in India.

"
"

  Very useless mobile this second replacement but this also defective .. suddenly its touchpad is not working...very very very useless pls dont buy this product

"
"

  When I get the phone it's speaker not working properly. I want to replace it with another one. So I am not satisfied with this item.

"

  Worst product, within one month start problem of hang. 70% of ram and rom are free although it hang

"
"

  Received defective adapter not even charging 1%.. Phone is absolutely fine later went to mi care centre to get new adapter.

"
"

  Decent camera and battery life. You get what you paid for. Microphone seems to have some issue. It's not picking up the sound properly when using loudspeaker.

"
"

  7499

"
"

  It's very good phone

"
"

  Mobile is best in this segmentBut fingerprint should be add for next modelsWithout fingerprint It becomes incomplete

"
"

  Some hanging problem this phone.......Delivery is have a handsome just 22 h

"
"

  Do not buy this product if you want a good camera quality, storage and battery life is good, there is no fingerprint feature available on this model.

"
"

  It took 4-5 hrs to get full charged. I replaced once but i guess all the phone have same issue, and i have to compromise with the product.

"
"

  Phone get hange within one weak of purchase and speaker is loose so i am not able to listen when someone call....In short worst phone dont buy.

"
"

  Very bad no fingerprint reader camera very poor battery life good

"
"

  Value for money, mobile is good for normal usages like watching YouTube videos, reading news, & social media's. Iam ok with this...

"

"

  Superb smartphone .

"
"

  Honestly I'll suggest that don't buy it, A lots of hanging problem, overheating problem, most of the time you need to restart/switch off this mobile

"
"

  The phone was good but its charger has occurred the problem in a few days only.its charger having bad quality.. And the exchange phone price is high

"
"

   Ghost touch problem...app crashes so many times...camera app crashes, youtube app crashes....hangs a lot.

"
"

  Great

"
"

  Nice phone built quality, battery also good, camera normal .... Overall budget phone ... 3gb/64gb internal storage..This phone batter for only normal users...

"
"

  Ordered this one and it wasn't charging. Thank you for the replacements. So ordered one more and that too isn't charging. You just earned this review.

"
"

  It doesn't have fingerprint, camera quality is okay not good but as the price it is okay.... Battery life is best

"
"

  Nice mobaile but Amazon delevery time so long

"
"

  First of all i found a defective product and from last four days I am trying to make it return ,No customer service executive is able to help me with it

"
"

  Received some refurbished product, when tried to put on exchange Amazon itself says IMEI number not matching with brand and model.

"
"

  Battery life is great,it will last upto 2.5 days if you use it for normal work.camera is ok.overall performance is great.

"
"

  Good one

"
"

  Not happy

"
"

  The smartphone is very good for those who don't do heavy gaming and for me it is very good but the only downside is the camera. The camera quality is very very poor.

"
"

"

  Budget mobile

"
"

  Good product. Worth for the money

"
"

  Camera quality was dissapointed, extremely poor👎👎Battery was OK,Sound quality was good ✌

  There is a lot of software glitch and the phone started hanging a lot just after delivery. The hardware is good though, although it's just been 21 days.

  Absolutely rubbish, lots and lots of hanging problem, apps not working properly at all, after visiting service center also.

"
"

  Display is Good, Battery life is Awesome, Audio output is good, Build quality is Very good, Processor is Average, Camera quality is average,

"
"

  This range Better deal to other brand, Great deal

"
"

  The colour varient of blue was awesome but the cameras are literally worst and the colour mostly for women not for men I buyed it for my sister

"
"

  This phone is not good I have just buy it 2 weeks before. It's apps are itself opening and phone is getting hang. It's waste of money.

"
"

  Overall the device looks good based on its price but there is no finger print and only face lock and password/pattern is available.

"
"

  Weight and no smooth curves,redmi 6 pro was good.

"
"

  Nice Smart Phone

"
"

  Very good product, but my redmi 8A is having power button problem.Automatically it is getting on/off/power off

"
"

  This is a fab product... delivered by Amazon...!!❤️❤️This phone has everything expected...!!

"
"

  My battery is draining fast than the same phone purchased from store😒not sure about that

"
"

  Good mobile...especially in this lock down period when other mobiles are either too costly or out of sale when try to purchase them.

"
"

  Mobile is getting hanged oftenly since 2 days after buying it and also battery gets discharged soon not as effective as 5000mah. Would like to replace the product.

"
"

  Awesome smartphone at low cost. 8 MP front selfie camera is very nice and 13+2 MP rear camera is awesome. Battery backup is also good.

"
"

  Photos quite opposite

"
"

  According to price this phone is good but not the best. I suggest you to buy 3+32gb segment phone rather than this phone.

"
"

  Chinese product

"
"

  Phone constantly hangs and full load of bloatware is installed.. even after clearing everything it's not at all fast..

"
"

  Very good product..happy with it...very good experience with the service of amazon...delivered on time...well behavior....thank you amazon

"
"

  Good phone.Only finger print sensor is missing in this...If was available would have rated 5

"
"

  Great

"
"

  I buyed 3 phones the same model all are same issue there is very poor network. The same sim I used different phone means it's work propely.

"
"

  USB TETHERING IS NOT SUPPORTED and TOO EXPENSIVE. REDMI Y2 HAVE 3GB RAM IN 8000, HERE YOU GET ONLY 2 GB RAM, ALSO CAN'T PLAY PUBG LIKE GAMES

"
"

  This is worest mobile. Don't buy this. Amazon service also too bad. Please don't buy the phones without observing the ratings and reviews

"
"

  Very nice phone with all the required features in less price.

"
"

  No notification light indicator/battery indicatorCamera quality 3/5Battery 4/5Face unlock is good

"
"

  This product is full value of money.I don't think that you will find any other Phone under this price range with so many latest features.

"
"

  Best in budget... Battery is awesome, camera is beautiful, but pixelete in night when using portrait. No lag, best for daily use.

"
"

  Super cool  design

"
"

  Phone is good but camera is not even satisfactory, don't buy this phone if you take photos often.

"
"

  This does not have a fingerprint sensor..but best budget phone one cannget under 7k

"
"

  Phone automatically switch off and automatically switch on

"
"

  The OS installed is worst and it has hardware issues. With in 6 days the mobile behaves crazy..

"
"

  Nice phone it is very reasonable product back camera is very good front camera is above average

"
"

  I am using from 1 month and I got really nice results from this mobile . Battery backup is so better and also camera .

"
"

  Internet stopped working after one month of usage. Long waiting at service center. Pathetic experience.

"
"

  Totally waste of money, I have purchased it before one month, this phone has hanging problem, too slow on performance, never go for it.

"
"

  Phone was working  fine for 10days. After that it stop working  all off sudden.  Any application cannot  be opened. Just waste of money
